								<h2>Riku, Charlotte, and an Evening at Hampshire Street</h2>
								<p>Quiet morning at home today, catching up on a few emails, reading the paper while eating breakfast, enjoying Judi's blackberry jam on Acme bread. This is one of the things I will miss most about the Bay Area... this wonderful bread always available! </p>
<p>I called Denver to speak to Uncle Frank in his new rehab centre; he was a little dozy but had his physio this morning and a good hearty breakfast. As soon as he finds out what is causing the dizziness and pain in his groin, he will be a happy camper, as he is so keen to get on with recovering from his surgery and getting out of the hospital setting. We didn't talk too long today, but he was happy to have a call, and filled me in on his treatment and better meals there. </p>
<p>Akane had called to suggest that today would be a good day to take Riku to the movies; "Charlotte's Web" was on our list. I spent an hour going through bags of clothes, and giveaway household items for the Goodwill, and packaged up five full bags ready to leave the house with us. This is the first of a major cleaning out I plan to do in 2007. </p>
<p>We picked Riku up at 12:45 (Bryn was tucking Mirei in, but she was up for more food shortly after that; this is a girl who wants a full tummy before she goes to sleep and makes her needs known too!), and I had lots of fun with Riku displaying his sunglasses on top of his head, pretending to be a "dude", making me laugh. Parking was easy, and Riku ran down all the hills on our way to the theatre. He stood with Doug buying tickets, looked at all the movie posters with great interest, and found seats with Doug while I bought the popcorn. There were lots of trailers, which Riku enjoyed, with questions about whether they looked scary to me, or OK. We munched on popcorn andate a couple of Twizzlers; I had apple juice with me for Riku. The movie was just great. Riku sat on his own seat for most of it, really taking it all in, and paying attention. I got a little snuggle in too, for a few minutes halfway through. </p>
<p>After the movie we raced each other from one tree or post to another, uphill to our car. Riku was tired but happy, and we dropped off the bags for Goodwill and then went off for some gelato near Amelia's old school. Riku and I had coconut, while Grandpa tried the strawberry. Yum! </p>
<p>We thought Bryn, Akane, and Mirei might be home, so we stopped in there, but headed for our house to wait for them when we found the house empty. Much to our surprise, they were already here, so we had tea and gingerbread, Riku played upstairs with his cars on his own, and Mirei made us all smile. She was sitting at the table, having polished off two jars of fruit and some veggies I heated up for her as well. What a grand little eater she is! </p>
<p>Doug and I had a light dinner at home, finished off a crossword puzzle, checked and wrote some emails, and headed over to Hampshire Street at 7:45 to babysit while Akane and Bryn went to a concert, a Christmas gift to Akane from Bryn. </p>
<p>Riku was already tucked into bed; this is his third night of falling asleep on his own and he didn't call out once... just two nights of trying and he's got it down flat! He did waken with a dream once and twice more, but for just seconds, before rolling over and sleeping again. </p>
<p>Mirei and I listened to a little music box from Japan, inspected the decorations on the tree, and I watched her explore the living room while waiting for Doug to come back from driving Akane & Bryn to the concert. She was soon rubbing her eyes, but once again made it perfectly clear that she needed more to eat before settling down for the night. </p>
<p>She ate a big bowl of oatmeal with blueberries, polishing it off in no time, while sitting on Doug's lap watching the tree lights. She looked so darling in her little sleeper blanket, putting her index finger to her mouth to let us know it was sleepy time... "shhhhh". Mirei also made it clear that she wanted to go right into her crib, and not be held as her dad had suggested. It's interesting as she just may know that is not how we do it at my house with me; I simply lay her down and put a hand on her tummy or leg, and then she figures out how to slip off to sleep. I was out of the room in less than five minutes this second time. </p>
<p>The rest of the evening was uneventful; Doug and I watched two episodes of a popular TV show we don't get, and then watched most of a wonderful British movie called "Goodnight Mr. Tom" which we had seen years before but enjoyed just as much the second time around. I had a little trouble staying awake during the cops and robbers shows, but was wide awake for the last of the evening. Doug picked the concert goers up at 12:40 and we were home just shortly after 1, and watching the last half hour of the movie. Bed at 2 A.M. for me. </p>
