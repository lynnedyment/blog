								<h2>"Dude... Let's Go!"</h2>
								<p>Oh, it was an early arising today. Doug woke me at 4:30 for a 4:45 departure for the airport. He is off to Kansas where it is very cold... just at freezing. Well, it's cold from our west coast viewpoint! I was back home and in bed with my warmed up bed buddies by 5:30 and asleep within minutes. I was very happy to get an extra two hours sleep in. </p>
<p>I had a very productive day at home. I answered a couple of emails but was determined to get birthday and anniversary cards organized for December through mid-January, as well as do the usual Monday washing. The cards take a long time, as I tend to write notes in the ones with whom I am not in touch via email... mostly the cards for the U.K. but a couple of other friends as well. The time flew by, as it always does; I took a quick walk to the mailbox to mail the ones for next week. The day had warmed up from the chilly morning; our temperature in the house hovers around 64F overnight, but with the sun up and shining brightly I don't need to leave the heat on for too long. </p>
<p>Akane arrived with Mirei at 2 o'clock as usual. She was a bright perky girl, having just awakened from a one and a half hour nap. Not that she doesn't smile her big smiles even when she's tired, though! First on the agenda... lunch time. She ate cereal and veggies, finished off with bananas and pears, and about half a teething biscuit; this kept her busy while pushing things off the table, one of her favourite things to do! Mirei made me laugh today, doing something she hadn't done here before, but apparently has been doing at home... she puts her head down on her arm,  which is lying flat on the table, and then looks up at me grinning away. It was obvious she wanted me to do the same thing and gave me that sweet Mirei laugh when I did so. Today I pointed out my ears to her and then took hold of hers. Then we did the same with the animals in the bedroom; she must be bored with touching noses so onward we go.  </p>
<p>We spent a little while upstairs in the master bedroom, just for a change. The room has lots of toys in it... a big container of plastic blocks and animals, Bryn's farm from when he was two years old, a Fisher-Price trailer of the same vintage, and another basket filled with children's books and stuffed animals. Mirei's favourite things to play with? Glad you asked. The phone with the seek button is what she heads for first! It drives her grandfather a little crazy as he can here it down here too, but my oh my, it makes her happy. What power! And today she learned how to turn it off too which is so very handy. It means she can make it ring over and over and over, and she does! </p>
<p>Grandpa's books on the lower shelf are of great interest to her too, but when forced to move away from them, she is quite happy to try to unplug the tv and/or music equipment instead. Now she can open my bedside drawers as well, all on her own, with some brute strength, but she does it, and there are all sorts of great things in there... little pots of lip salve, wooden rollers for my back, hand cream in tubes, a scented candle which used to sit on top until she discovered it tasted quite good. The room takes much longer to tidy up these days then it did just a week ago! </p>
<p>Then it was time to get up and move around. Bryn had mentioned the other day how fast Mirei is at getting around now and is she ever. One minute she is in the kitchen pulling herself up on the play kitchen in the eating area, and the next minute she has rebooted my computer and is on her way to the living room to stare at the folk art chickens. Mirei continues to purse up her lips in a tight little "oh" movement, and point around at whatever has caught her eye... the clock, the gum ball-like container that she is used to Doug shaking at her, or the frog perched way up on the hutch. Mirei is used to Doug being here to show her all these things, as he carries her around.Today I asked her where Grandpa was and she craned her neck around to where he usually sits at his computer.. and he wasn't there! I'm sure she wonders where he could be. </p>
<p>We left the house at 4:15 to meet Akane and Riku in the playground. He came running over to give me a hug, and when Mirei woke from her short nap, he gave her hugs and kisses too. He is always so happy to see her, and it's adorable to see her happy response to seeing him. Akane left to prepare dinner, Mirei didn't stay sleeping with the noise from playing children, so soon she was happily sitting in the sandbox with Riku and a little girl just over one year old. Mirei used to put everything into her mouth, but now only the interesting things go in... not the sand, but any little found objects... a stick yesterday. She responds very well to being told no so it's fun sitting there with her as she plays with the coarse sand and lets it run through her hands. She and the other child touched each others faces, and held hands, and looked at each other. Riku entertained us by running and then leaping into the sandbox, being careful to avoid coming close to the little ones. He is attempting to climb up the high dome there now; he really wants to do it and I think if his cousins were here he would be up at the top in no time. </p>
<p>At 5 P.M. it was getting cold, and so we left, strolling home slowly, which gave Riku lots of time to explore. He peeked under the bottoms of the new garages just built at the complex that has been going up for months and months, stopped to run his fingers through the lavender planted along the sides of that building, dashing to me to let Mirei and me smell, and checking out anything new along that street... a contrail today, and the comment that a dog that usually barks from behind a gated door was not home today. I explained what "strolling" was, dashing with his hand in mine at first, and then slowing way down so we could "stroll", a much nicer way to get home. At some point on this walk Riku looked up at me and said "Dude, let's go!" It was so funny and made me laugh out loud. He drags out the first word so it sounds like "duuuuuuddde," and then of course we both then started saying it, sometimes at the exact same moment, which made us both laugh out loud. What a funny boy he is. Bryn said later he learns so much from the children at school and this is one of them. I now hear talk of "power rangers" which is what he already plans to be for Hallowe'en next year. </p>
<p>The evening with the children and Bryn passed quickly... Riku played in the kitchen while I fed Mirei; Bryn came back from dropping Akane off for her 6 P.M. Chinese class, and we all sat at the table while Riku ate his dinner. He and I had some time playing on his bed with a sticker book; he was putting together a train scene and really enjoying it. Then it was PJ time, teeth brushed, and into bed for a long chapter in "Walter the Lazy Mouse". Bryn thought since it was so early he could hear two chapters tonight but it was obvious he was fast ready for tuck-in time. He was asleep before 7:30 but woke an hour later, possibly with a bad dream, so I snuggled in next to him for about ten or fifteen minutes until he was deep asleep again. </p>
<p>Bryn had cleaned the kitchen, tucked Mirei into bed, and had tea ready for us when I walked out the second time. He showed me some of the vintage Christmas tree ornaments he had just put top bids on through EBay and even managed to find a tree topper just like the one we have! It was never my favourite but both Bryn and Doug think it's just perfect. </p>
<p>We had a little time to chat about their trip to Ontario, although only got to the end of the first few days when he left at 9:10 to pick up Akane.  I did a little annotating on Amelia's online birthday photo album, and then walked home in the crisp cold but clear night, thanks to the full moon. Just gorgeous! </p>
<p>I had spoken with Doug on Skype this afternoon, just as he settled into his hotel room. He no doubt went off to bed early too; I was up the stairs with lights out by 11:15.</p>
<p>P.S. I remembered the next morning that Mirei had her first ride on the round-about at the playground and quite enjoyed it. She also managed to climb up two of the stairs on her own going up to the second floor! When I caught her at it, she turned and gave me a big smile as though to say "Just look how clever I am!" </p>
