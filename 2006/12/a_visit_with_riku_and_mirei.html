								<h2>A Visit with Riku and Mirei</h2>
								<p>Bryn dropped Riku off here this morning, later than I expected, as Riku had gone to bed later than usual lat night, and had slept in a bit today.</p>
<p>We were heading off to the Bay Area Discovery Museum with Susan and Amelia, and there was time to get a nice big bowl of cereal into him, especially good as it keeps him happy when he is a little short on sleep. Both children are ready for earlier than usual lunches too. after running around the playground.  </p>
<p>It was <strong>so</strong> cold here today! The temp' in the house was down to 60ÂºF this morning again ... brrrr! There was frost on the car across the street today and yesterday too; if it had rained we would have snow! Crazy weather for us to have here and I am not used to it.</p>
<p>The children had lots of fun, as always, and kept so busy with the inside and outside activities. They kept warm running around, and thank goodness the sun came out and warmed things up on the other side of the Golden Gate bridge. A big cup of hot tea helped while the children played on the boat. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I forgot my camera at home this morning and so only have shots of the children at home today. I'm hoping to get some from Susan from our outing, though, as she always takes great shots of them. </p>
<p>Despite the busy hours there, Riku stayed awake the entire way home; I couldn't believe it, especially after all the food he ate! However, three minutes from the house his eyes started to close. I played a little "windstorm" game by opening and closing the windows in the car. It worked; he was giggling away and we made it home. I could have put him down for a nap but it made more sense to me to have him ready for an earlier bedtime.</p>
<p> I picked up Mirei, leaving Riku with Doug for a few minutes. Doug has been really busy  working on a project for work today, so it was good for them to have a little time alone together, before busy Mirei arrived. She and Riku had some time to play together. How this little girl loves to watch every little thing that Riku does, and tries so hard to do whatever it is along with him. They played in the living room, in the bedroom with the cars, and then shared a gingerbread cookie in the kitchen too. Mirei spotted Riku with one, and not willing to be left out, went up to him making it clear she wanted some as well. Riku is always very generous with her, and happily broke off a piece for her. </p>
<p>Mirei looked dressed for the holidays in a gorgeous little pair of pinky red silk pants of Amelia's, which I had never seen on Amelia. Mirei's big smiles and happy demeanor make every day feel special, though, even without the festive togs. </p>
<p>Riku put together two puzzles while I fed her and tucked her in at 4:30, later than would have been ideal, but she napped late with Akane this morning at home. She has a little cold and certainly needed the extra rest. She slept until 6 P.M.</p>
<p>As soon as she was asleep, Riku and I went upstairs to watch "Charlie Brown's Christmas", which arrived in the mail today along with the others we had ordered.<br />
 <br />
Bryn told me earlier he would be running some errands, and would be later than usual picking Riku up, so I asked if Riku could just sleep here. I really wanted him in bed at 7 as he was tired, so this made sense for all of us. Mirei would have been full of energy just when Riku was flagging and needing the house quieter. After a good dinner, and a long fun tub time Riku was asleep at 7:05! Good thing too, as Bryn is taking him for breakfast at Jim's at 8 a.m. with Brent and Mari. </p>
<p>I made up a new batch of gingerbread and worked on writing messages in our last three Christmas cards. </p>
