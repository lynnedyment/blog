								<h2>Mirei Lunches at Green's</h2>
								<p>Susan phoned this morning to see if I would like to join her and Kevin at <em>Green's</em>, the wonderful vegetarian restaurant located on the waterfront at Fort Mason, with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. I haven't been for a couple of years and eagerly accepted the invitation. Today was to have been my full day with Mirei, but she nodded off for her morning nap before Akane got her over to me. Of course my morning flew by, filled with all the bits and pieces of random chores, a long chat with Neal on the phone, and then it was time to pick up a well rested Mirei at 11:50. </p>
<p>Our dining companions were old friends of Susan's, who first befriended one of their sons at art school in Halifax. She has kept in touch with them over the years and they manage to get together once in a rare while. Ike and Diana are the parents, and their friend Irene is traveling with them from their homes in Alberta. They are just the loveliest of people: world travelers, very interested in art, and so very warm and friendly. </p>
<p>Of course they all thought Mirei was such a sweet girl; she sat in a high chair ever so nicely for most of our two hour lunch, although she also had Susan and Kevin holding her in between courses. On the way out of the restaurant, the hostess made it a point to comment on how well behaved she was. </p>
<p>We all started the meal with a wonderful kabocha squash soup; Mirei had some too, along with crumbled nori, which I had taken along. She daintily ate small pieces of Acme whole wheat bread; what good taste she has already! I had my very favourite vegetable and tofu brochette with a green salad, and two wonderful desserts were ordered for all of us to share. Green's makes its own ice cream and today's was a fresh mint ice cream, sandwiched between meringues plus a fabulous pumpkin brulee with sweetened cranberries. We were treated to the meal by Ike and Diana, even though we protested in vain. It was such a treat to be at Green's again and especially with such good and interesting company. </p>
<p>Mirei had napped for an hour and a half at home, dozed off on the half hour it took me to get to Green's... traffic was terrible and I took a much longer route than was ideal... and then she napped on the way home for about twenty minutes. Not good. I fed her, and hoped she would drift off but soon realized she needed to have time to explore... too much sitting for her so far! </p>
<p>Riku and Akane were home from school early; Riku came in bearing a birthday gift from the school... they hold a birthday party each month for those children born that month, and the gift was a big scrapbook for their school years. There was a gift for Mirei to open as well, which she did on her own!, and it was a lovely soft pink hand-knitted scarf that Susan's mother made for her. It was a thank you to me for having taken care of Amelia while Susan and Kevin were away two weeks ago. It is really lovely with strands of pastel wool knitted through the ends of the scarf. </p>
<p>Susan had loaned me their copy of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"; Doug had ordered a set of three Christmas DVDs this morning, but I thought watching one today would be a treat for Riku. Akane and I had our tea upstairs, Riku had his snack from school, and a plate of strawberries and grapes while we watched the movie. He quite enjoyed it, although he didn't want to hear so much singing (it's Burl Ives singing and narrating), as he wanted to know what was going to happen with the snow monster wandering about in the country! </p>
<p>Mirei was very happy sorting through my bedside drawers and pressing the ringer on the phone to locate it! She was mighty pleased with the results but Grandpa less so. Akane was heading for home just before 5 P.M. to prepare dinner so I suggested that she leave the children here. </p>
<p>Bryn showed up nice and early at the end of this work week, and off he went home with Riku, as I thought it might work out for Mirei to have her (late) afternoon nap here. However, she slept for only a half hour and then wakened crying and inconsolable until I gave up and dressed her. I think she might be teething, or perhaps she was thrown off with the twenty minute nap, so after a little more crawling around, Doug and I walked her home. I knew if we put her in her stroller she would be asleep in minutes so Doug carried her home in the dark. What a treat for her: he stopped to show her neon lights and the cars going in both directions on the highway below the overpass, touch leaves, and look in brightly lit store windows. </p>
<p>Susan called to say that Amelia has a fever again and had a not so wonderful afternoon at school today; it was such a shame as she was game to go this morning and was back to just not feeling well at 3 P.M. I'm so glad it's the weekend and she will have two days to recover from whatever is going on with her. We've had our fair share of fevers in the family this week! </p>
<p>Doug and I had a light dinner upstairs while watching a taped show; I tidied up and sat at the computer while he watched another show. It feels like the end of the week to me too, and what a lovely way it was to end it. I just totally relaxed and didn't do a productive thing after my lunch out... until this evening. Hard to believe it's Friday already! </p>
<p>P.S. Bryn IM'd tonight to say that Riku is starting piano lessons next week... Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:15 until 1:45. One of the mothers from his preschool will be the teacher. We are all hoping he enjoys them! </p>
