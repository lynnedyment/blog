								<h2>An Amelia Saturday</h2>
								<p>Our day began at 7:30 when Amelia rolled over, smiled at me, and then leaned over to give me a kiss, telling me she loves me. How very sweet; she had rolled over about 6:30, half sat up and looked around the room, and then cuddled in again next to me. I woke up at 7:15 and lay quietly waiting for Amelia. We did just what I had promised her last night would happen, starting off our day by reading in bed, and then when we heard Grandpa, we covered ourselves completely with the duvet, and waited for him to "find" us. We had deliberately left the monitor running so he would hear us, and he went through the routine of coming in to see if we were there, checking out the bathroom, then the kitchen and on to the front door to see if we were downstairs. Finally, hearing some giggling, he came into the room again, hearing some little giggles and/or seeing something moving. Amelia gave out a big shriek when he discovered us and pulled off the cover. We read three more books before getting up. </p>
<p>Oh, one funny thing happened... I was all stretched out with my ankles crossed once we had pulled the covers up again, and when Amelia was getting out of bed she told me I looked just like a carrot! </p>
<p>We had a nice quiet few hours at home this morning with no rushing about, and no hurry to get out. Amelia played happily at the desk, drawing pictures and sorting through the rubber dinosaurs and other tiny animals. I checked my emails, and then dashed upstairs to shower quickly, before joining Amelia for breakfast of eggs, "sausage" for her and "bacon" for me, plus toast and juice. I had time to read the paper too, while Amelia entertained herself in the bedroom with the stuffed animals and with more drawings. </p>
<p>Finally it was time to go off to the playground; the day was warm and sunny early today and there were lots of children there with their dads. Amelia found a three-year-old boy named Cameron to play with; we may have met him before. They are just a couple of weeks apart in age, and played well together. Amelia was sad when he finally had to leave, but there were three other children still there over the noon hour to play with. I chatted with a young mom and dad who had an eight-and-a-half-month-old daughter named Zia; she was a smiley girl like Mirei, only much bigger... St. Bernard hands and feet. Her mom thought she was big and laughed when I mentioned the size of her hands especially! </p>
<p>Amelia came running over to tell me she had pushed a girl off the climbing structure; it's interesting that she doesn't hesitate to say what she did. We sat on a bench and had the lunch I had packed; I decided it was nap time with no extra time for playing and after a stop at the library for a bathroom break we were in the car and driving. Amelia was asleep in less than fifteen minutes and slept for two solid hours. Once again I napped while we were parked in a fairly quiet shady spot, although Amelia had no trouble with the big service trucks that rumbled by occasionally. </p>
<p>Home for some playtime here; Amelia took great delight in using the grownup scissors to cut paper. She hadn't quite managed yesterday but today made a fringe all around her drawing! She did four drawings today and of course they all go up on the windows. Sometime soon I must take photos of them all and take them down so we can see out to the garden! </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin called to speak with Amelia; I held the phone to her ear and she answered Susan's questions about her days, but then passed the phone to me telling me it was my turn now. They had just eaten dinner and been bowling, relaxing and enjoying their time together. I was hoping to hear that Susan was sleeping through the night, but it didn't happen. Too bad... but too many years of waking frequently in the night have created a pattern that is hard to break. </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin had told us to treat ourselves to Amici's pizza, delivered, as their treat, and so we ordered it at 5 P.M. I had asked for take-out though; Doug thought it would be good to get out anyway, and just as we were getting into the car, along comes the Amici delivery car! It was our order, delivered at 5:20(!) and I was delighted not to have to go out after all. It was delicious; we had a salad too, and Amelia ate a whole piece as well as some spinach and rice. </p>
<p>While I tidied up the kitchen, Amelia played more at the table (she has really entertained herself so well today and yesterday!), and then I ran the tub. All the plastic and rubber animals went in, Amelia had a grand ol' time, and I sat on the floor with my tea, playing the part of King Kong wanting to be friends with a little blue turtle. </p>
<p>Of course we did the usual wrapping in the big warm blue towels, which both children love, and Amelia knows the massage routine oh-so-well, thrusting out one limb to have rubbed at a time. Tonight she asked me to put my fingers between her toes and fingers, even though the toes tickle her a bit.  </p>
<p>Doug read her one book again tonight, and I the second, and then came a few tears. She and I snuggled in while we talked about our day and what we might do tomorrow. When I was going over the day with her I deliberately left out the fact that she had pushed a little girl, but she prompted me immediately when I went on to our picnic on the bench! </p>
<p>I had turned out the light at 7:45 tonight, expecting it would take me forty-five minutes to settle her in, but it took an hour and a half! I was very surprised as she was tired and relaxed after her tub, happy to get into bed for stories, and settled down very quickly... but not to sleep. I kept thinking she was asleep too... nice even breathing, not moving an inch, but three times when I tried to get out of bed Amelia was promptly up asking where I was going and back we would be at step one. </p>
<p>Time for emails and a little bit of sorting of the baby clothes, now pulled out of the chest of drawers in the guest room and piled on the living room sofa! </p>
