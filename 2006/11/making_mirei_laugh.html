								<h2>Making Mirei Laugh...</h2>
								<p>I woke up today with no sinus pressure; what a relief; that little Neti pot of Bryn's did the trick! More sleep would have been good, but going to bed after 12:30 does not guarantee that. I woke at 6:45... too early, so vow tonight I will be tucked in by 11 P.M. </p>
<p>On with my day... I finished the ironing! Yahoo! I must, must, must keep up from now until forever, as there is nothing I dread more in the housekeeping mode than a rack filled with shirts and slacks needing to be pressed. </p>
<p>The rest of my morning was as usual, and at 12:15 I went off to pick up Amelia from daycare. When she was saying goodbye to the other children, she went behind each of them, put her hands on each side of their heads, and leaned over to kiss them on the top of their heads! It was adorable. </p>
<p>She will soon be moving to a five-morning-a-week Montessori program, closer to her home, so we won't be stopping for our coconut gelato any longer. It was a treat to do so today, another warm and sunny one here, once the heavy fog lifted, and we sat on the sidewalk chairs talking about contrails (none spotted today) and the tall steeple we can see from that vantage point.</p>
<p>Amelia did a couple of drawings for me, which are now hanging on the kitchen window, and played on her own until it was nap time. I wish I could tell you that Amelia had a lovely long nap, or even a short one(!), but again today she was determined not to sleep, and that was that. She allows herself to come close, cooperating after a while and closing her eyes, but just as she is close to dropping off, she senses it and sits right up. Today, however, I left her three times for five minutes each on her own, hoping she would drift off, but each time she called out. She agreed to stay in bed for ten minutes, not crying, and not getting out of bed, and she kept that promise. Up she got; we will try again on Thursday. It is so obvious that she is tired, but it's mind over matter and Amelia has her mind made up some days that it's not going to work. </p>
<p>She was delighted to find Mirei here when she came out of her room; the feeling was mutual. They sat together on the floor, playing with long necklaces and flashlights. At one point Mirei was in the small bedroom, while Amelia stayed outside in the hallway, playing peek-a-boo with her. The laughing went on and on, with Mirei having that wonderful belly laugh babies have at this age, and Amelia taking such pleasure in making her happy. </p>
<p>Amelia is always game for playing outside, so off we went at 4 o'clock to meet Akane and Riku at the 23rd Street playground. Riku came barreling up to me when he spotted us and asked, "Why were you not there when I got here?" I guess we usually are first, and I'm sure he had been waiting all of five minutes at the most. Nice to know I'm missed! </p>
<p>Akane had been chatting with a young mom named Kim, whose daughter is just ten days or so younger than Mirei. Her name is Vivian, not a typical name for these times, and she's very sweet. She too is standing, and doesn't want to sit down; she was trying to get her little leg over the edge of the small wall we were sitting on. Both girls have four teeth, and are at the same point of standing/walking, so have lots in common. We hope to see them again, as they live just a block from the playground and go twice a day. </p>
<p>Amelia and Riku had a great time together; they climbed on the open dome, took turns pushing and being pushed on the round-about, kicked a ball back and forth to each other, and played with the sand toys for a bit. </p>
<p>Mirei sat and let the coarse pebbles stream through her fingers; we must do this more often with her, as Riku was an old hat at it by this stage. Of course he was not a child who put everything into his mouth the way that Mirei does right now; she's bound and determined to taste everything! However, she really didn't try to eat it today, so we will do more sitting in the sandbox in the coming months. </p>
<p>Akane and Mirei left when it got quite cool, and Akane kindly lent me her scarf. It was so warm in Potrero Hill, and so cool in the Mission District... brrr. Riku and I kicked a ball back and forth for a while, and then he and Amelia played in the outside area on the other side of the playground until Susan joined us. We said our goodbyes and left at the same time. </p>
<p>Susan wrote later to let me know that Amelia did fall asleep on the way home; not a surprise at all, as she was tired when she was fighting sleep here four hours earlier. One day she will realize, I hope, how good it is to allow herself to drift off. </p>
<p>Made a cup of hot tea, ate a light dinner, and had planned to watch a movie with Doug once he got home at 7:30. However, it was a samurai film called "Harikari", which was too dark and depressing for me to watch after a busy day. We saw it many years ago at UBC in Vancouver, as I recognized bits and pieces of it while putting the laundry away. So down I came and got lots of emails answered instead, although somehow my inbox is filled to the bottom of the "page" again! </p>
<p>Up to bed at 11:30 P.M.</p>
<p>P.S. Election day and at this hour the Democrats are in the lead by a good margin!</p>
