								<h2>A Busy Saturday</h2>
								<p>Mirei arrived at the door today with her dad at 11 a.m. this morning. It is such fun peeking at her through the glass and seeing that big smile as she recognizes my face. Her parents and brother were off to Japantown and to run other birthday-related errands for Riku's birthday party tomorrow. His actual birthday is on Monday, but friends and their parents are invited over tomorrow from 11- 1p.m. </p>
<p>Today when Doug was carrying her up the stairs, Mirei was craning her neck to see the bird that hangs on the back wall. She is at such a sweet stage as objects become familiar to her. She likes me to pull the broom over to her when she's sitting at the table so she can touch the bristles, always points up to the large frog from Mexico in the dining room, and now is moving her fingers back and forth to indicate the clock bonging away. </p>
<p>Bryn had told me that she was tired and ready to eat, so after a bowl of cereal and two little dishes of pears, she waved bye bye to Grandpa and off we went to bed. Such an easy routine for this girl... wrap the soft blue blanket around her firmly, start the bird swinging, turn on the sound machine to the waves, and rub her tummy for just a very few minutes. Two weeks ago she started making lots of noise is she lies there settling herself... big loud grrrrr's, patting the back of her hand against her mouth so she makes the "ba ba ba" rhythmic sound we all know so well, playing with her hands and fingers, and finally starts to drift off by rubbing her ears and her head. Riku rubbed his head as well when he was settling himself, so it's fun to see his sister comfort herself in the same way. </p>
<p>She slept for two hours and forty-five minutes! At the hour mark I heard her make a little noise, and she smiled at me, making me think for a minute that her cat nap at home and this nap was all she needed. However, as I was pulling her shirt over her head she started fussing, making her tired sound, so the blanket went back 'round her, and she was asleep two minutes later... for an extra 95 minutes! </p>
<p>I made a carrot cake and then called Don to wish him a happy birthday; my baby brother is 53 years old today! We had a very long chat; he has no special plans for dinner but he and Beth were going out to see a puppy for the second time. This will be the first dog they have owned but it's a little house dog and won't tear up his carefully tended and lovely gardens. </p>
<p>Mirei likes raisin toast, and sat at the table feeding herself little bits while I spooned in lentils and veggies. She was playing happily on the floor when Bryn and Riku came in for a little visit. Riku wanted to paint, after he had eaten a snack... juice and raisin toast with cream cheese, and Mirei was busier than I have ever seen her pulling herself up on the kitchen chairs and carefully lowering herself down again. I worry when she does this on the wood floors, but she is so controlled now. I worry more about her pulling the plastic play kitchen over, but for now she is very happy pulling all the items from the top of that shelf down instead. Oh, I took some photos of her feeding her dad; he just has to say "ahhh" with his mouth open and she will pop some food in for him. It's a game and she takes pleasure in it. I remember Riku doing exactly the same thing, although he learned eventually to pull it away at the last minute, and then laughed so hard when Bryn looked surprised to not have it! How the time has flown! </p>
<p>We all left the house a 5 p.m. Riku waves and blows kisses each and every time, and it's lovely to see. That little family of three went home to join Akane, while Doug and I went to Safeway for a few groceries. Then it was time for dinner at Cafe Gratitude, our second visit using Doug's birthday certificate from Akane and Bryn. It was already very busy at 5:45 but we shared a communal table, as we did the last time, and once again enjoyed our dinners so much. I could easily eat my way through their menu, although the amusing thing is, that whilst eating my main course tonight, I realized I had ordered the same dish as I had in August! It was a "warm grain" dish, called "I Am Grateful", consisting of steamed quinoa, delicious small fresh tomatoes, and a fresh basil-almond pesto. It is so good and I ate only one third of it; I'll happily be eating it again tomorrow, and perhaps on Monday as well. Doug and I also shared an appetizer called "I Am Insightful"; it was "live samosas-two spinach-wrapped samosas filled with almond sesame pate and marinated veggies, served with a spicy fresh mint dipping sauce.  There is no flour used for the samosas but only pressed spinach that has dried. It's amazing how good this all is! Doug had one of the specials.. an spicy enchilada served with fresh dressed greens, and quinoa. One day I am going to order one of their salads as they look so wonderful. In the evenings I always am drawn to the warm dishes. </p>
<p>I cleaned up the kitchen, and we went upstairs to watch a movie, with no internet for five hours at that point. Doug was told there were problems with the phone company and that they expect to have it fixed in the wee hours. Bed at 11 p.m., a good excuse to get up there early, with no last messages to write. </p>
