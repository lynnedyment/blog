								<h2>Jody Leaves for Snowbound Vancouver</h2>
								<p>It looked this morning as if Jody really would be leaving San Francisco, after her canceled flight to Vancouver scheduled for last night. So we had a bonus day ahead of us, which flew by as quickly as the last eight days. We had oatmeal for breakfast, later than Jody would have liked it, I'm sure, as I slept in until almost 8 A.M. today. We sat in the living room, enjoying the sunshine while reading; I was determined to read the morning paper before leaving the house today. </p>
<p>Finally, at 11 o'clock we headed off to Noe Valley for some leisurely window shopping. Chilly day despite the sunshine... brrr! However, It was a neighbourhood we hadn't explored this trip, and there are many interesting independent shops there. We oohed and ahhed over darling baby clothes, admired the antique-looking Christmas hanging mats, and found some very funny Christmas and birthday cards. We sampled various creams for our hands, with vanilla and shea butter combined to make us smell very nice indeed. We spent quite a bit of time in the knitting and wool shop too, admiring all the gorgeous yarns. It has been a long time since I had the time to just meander like this in San Francisco, and it was great fun. </p>
<p>I found a few Christmas gifts as well, and a heavy stainless steel container that sits in the corner of my sink. I always hoped to find an antique enamel one like the one we had when we were kids, but I have almost given up hope of finding one that isn't too rusty. </p>
<p>We stopped at each posted menu we passed, and I finally realized I was hungry. We held out, though, until we had explored each store that interested us, and instead of coming home and eating some of the leftover Chinese and Thai food we have in the fridge, we convinced each other that it would be a long time before we could just sit and enjoy a restaurant meal together. Part of this was due to the board menu at <em>Pasta Pomodoro</em>, stating that the special of the day was penne with lemon sauce, and soup or salad. The salad was just great with mixed greens, freshly shaved Parmigiana cheese, bits of blue cheese, and a perfectly light vinaigrette. We were both hungry and enjoyed the focaccia with pesto alongside it, but the pasta was divine! </p>
<p>And of course one can't leave Noe Valley without buying a coconut macaroon at the local bakery. I had ordered three topped with chocolate but discovered they were sans chocolate once we got home. Oh well, they were still moist and delicious. </p>
<p>We went directly over to "Little Angels" preschool to pick up Riku. The small foyer at the school is wonderfully decorated with a huge Christmas tree, with tiny Ultramen on it as well as all the usual baubles... Riku was thrilled with it when Bryn dropped him off this morning... and we stopped to admire it on the way out at 3 o'clock. </p>
<p>Mirei has a fever still today, and Jody wanted to see Amelia before leaving, so today worked out well for us. Akane stayed home with Mirei and we made plans with Susan to meet at their playground at 3:15; we all arrived at the same time with Amelia and Riku spotting each other from across the park and waving madly to each other. It was very cute to see. We went upstairs for a few minutes, put an extra layer of clothing on each child, plus mittens(!), and off we went to the playground for an hour and a bit. I got to be the monster again and chased them merrily around the slides and swings, while Jody and Susan chatted; it has been almost two years since they last met. Jody of course sees lots of photos of Amelia, but it was great that we managed to get them together before another year or more passes. </p>
<p>Riku was a tired boy as we drove home. He had a bag full of art projects with him, and had shown them all to us when we picked him up; there were autumn leaves cut from orange, yellow, and green paper, which Riku held up while singing "Autumn leaves are falling down... " to the tune of "London Bridge is Falling Down", a very colourful and beautifully decorated Indian headdress, and the cutest Thanksgiving turkey, done up in a paper frame complete with a wool hanger. Riku's eyes were closing, closing, as we pulled up in front of the house at almost 5 P.M; he still has a cough and is obviously still jet-lagged, but what a trooper he was, giving his sister a big hug when he went into the house. She was happy to see him too; Akane says she is so happy to have company and is a happier baby with lots of people around. It was hard to just kiss and run but we did. Jody had a date with an airplane! </p>
<p>We had just enough time for a mug of hot chocolate and a half macaroon each, Doug had put the bags in the car before he left for the bus to T'ai Chi, and we drove off to SFO at 5:35. Traffic was light, and we had Jody checked in and heading for Immigration and Customs by 6:05. The week together flew by and we packed lots into it. I would never have gotten so much of my shopping done if Jody hadn't been with me, and now I must get busy for the following week and wrap it all up. It seems strange to be mailing gifts to Toronto, but the earlier the better. This will be my first Christmas ever without Kelly, Brynnie, and Caillie. It's hard to imagine, but I also know how lucky I am to have spent so many with them; some grandmothers aren't nearly so fortunate... but still... </p>
<p>I had forty-five minutes in the house on my own before leaving to pick up Doug from his class. It ran long tonight and so he didn't get to eat dinner until almost 8 P.M., but he enjoyed the leftover pasta and bread as much as we had; I added fresh tomato to his to make it stretch further and we both had a tiny sticky bun Susan had kindly handed over to me at her house. Yum! Warm with butter... oh yes! </p>
<p>We went upstairs to watch a rented DVD of an Eddie Izzard concert filmed in San Francisco; I thought he was a singer, and was quite delighted by the humour of this very funny comedian. We were laughing out loud at so many parts of it; I know he wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea, but we were entertained for almost two hours. </p>
<p>Time for a blog finally(!) ... and reading a few emails too. Bryn IM'd to say Riku was asleep at 7:45 and Mirei tucked in at 8:30. I hope Amelia was snugged in early too; she was as pale as Riku was at the playground, although they both had such fun together. Riku calls her "Melia"; I thought I had better make a note of it in case we forget. They are growing up so very quickly... </p>
<p>Bryn IM'd me with a photo of Mirei in Japan, being admired by a group of nurses at the clinic where Akane's grandmother lived. I got to see those very chubby cheeks of hers again! My favourite current thing of hers right now is the way she says "Oh!" when she spots something and then points to it. That little mouth just puckers right up! What a darling baby girl she is...</p>
<p>And then Bryn wrote: "Riku is sooooooo silly... was having what seemed like a half-dozen or so parallel conversations with himself. " Almost every day brings something new with one of the three children here in San Francisco. How lucky I am to be here with them all!  <br />
