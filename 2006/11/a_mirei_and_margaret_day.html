								<h2>A Mirei ... and Margaret Day!</h2>
								<p>Well, this was another busy day that just flew by. Doug and I were both amazed to find it was 1 A.M. when we turned out the lights! My day started off by picking up Akane, Riku, and Mirei at 9:15 for the drive to school. Mirei promptly fell asleep, and Riku entertained us with making body sounds, naming them in Japanese and then giggling away! I told him he was "sooooo four year old male" and he liked the sounds of that too; kept repeating "soooo four year old" and making me laugh. We know where he gets his potty humour; I laughed when his dad did the same thing... something I lived to regret by the time he was seven. I can't take all the credit though; it does seem to be a boy thing.</p>
<p>Akane was going to a pot luck gathering at the home of one of the "Little Angels" preschool group; it was a chance for the adult group to get to know each other, and lasted all morning and up 'til 1 P.M. when many of the children get picked up. Akane had a great time, and stayed in the area until 3 P.M. when she met Riku. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mirei was here with me, making as big a mess as she possibly could in the time she had between eating and napping! She pulled herself up on the play kitchen again today, but this time decided she could reach the top shelf and pull down all the little plastic cups, glasses, and plates too. They came crashing down all around her and was she pleased with herself! Oh yes! And then it was on to the big basket, where she pulled out everything she could find by sticking her hand in and wiggling it around until hitting pay dirt. Of course, in between these two occupations, she was busy trying to reboot my computer or, at the very least, try to get behind the sideways placed rocking stool that Doug puts in her way. All those blinking lights, though, just catch her eye every time she is on her way to Grandpa. This little girl just doesn't give up! We now clap our hands and/or say "No no!" to her, which makes her smile her lovely smile and get back to it as fast as she can maneuver under and around the seat! What a gal!</p>
<p>Doug has been very busy working at his computer this past week, but Mirei knows he needs a break now and then. Using that little finger of hers, she goes in, plops herself beside him, catches his eye eventually, and then points... to the chiming clock (she's opening and closing her fist now for the tick tock), or to the giant frog on top of the hutch. Doug walks her around the house, strumming the strings on the various instruments hanging on the living room walls, stopping to show her the photo of her Daddy and Auntie Kelly from fifteen plus years ago, and letting her check out the bird in the downstairs hallway. She's very appreciative, as she wants to see them every single day, if not more often. </p>
<p>When I'm feeding Mirei her veggies, fruit, or cereal at the table, she will use that finger to point to her water glass when she wants to drink. It's time to get out the baby signs book and start teaching her those. Amelia had a huge vocabulary long before she could talk, and it was the most amazing thing to see. She has been pointing for some time at the brooms when I ask where they are, and is quite intrigued with the "Aunt Jemima" bank and the twirling wind-up duck on a bike on the bookshelves too; she makes it quite clear that she wants to have a closer look at them. What a fun time this is; her world is <strong>so</strong> exciting! </p>
<p>Mirei napped for only an hour in the car and so was ready for her afternoon nap right at noon hour today. She slept for an hour and a half, and then had a lovely long warm bath with lots of water in the tub. At home she bathes in the sink still, and it's such fun to her to be able to be "floated" along on my hands and arms. She puts her head back and seems to really enjoy that sensation. And of course splashing hard on the water is huge fun! She blinks the water away from her eyes, leans way over to grab a duck or spinning toy, and wasn't all that keen to get out of the tub even after a good half hour. I wrapped her in the big blue towel, warm from the dryer, which Amelia and Riku both like so much as well. Mirei enjoyed her massage with cream, just as they do, although she was less patient for getting her back rubbed. </p>
<p>On to food! She ate three times today; can't believe how that little mouth just opens for the next bite even after she had eaten a good sized bowl of whole grain cereal and a lot of fruit and/or veg! Of course she is burning a lot of calories just trying to keep my house in chaos, so I shouldn't be surprised. </p>
<p>Off we went in the stroller at 3:45. Usually Akane takes Mirei home  in the stroller while I take Riku to the playground; often Mirei is having her afternoon nap then or just waking, but today Akane and Riku met us there. It was such fun to watch Mirei watching the world out there! We stopped on the highway overpass, as we always used to do with Riku, so she could see the cars speeding by under us, and of course I stopped to let her smell the flowers and touch some leaves and vines. That little back was just so straight, taking in the world in the ten blocks or so between us and the playground. </p>
<p>Riku was as delighted to see me as Mirei was her mommy! Mommy means nursing and Mirei has no patience at all once Akane is within sight; just pass her over and let her settle in and you have a happy girl. Riku is delighted to have me sit in the sandbox with him, and bury each other's feet. He seemed very tired to me, and later Bryn said he was awake at 6 A.M.; that hour, and sometimes an hour and a half, less sleep showed in his white face and dark eyes. He did lots of running and jumping though, but was not happy to leave the playground so soon. I decided a slow walk home for him would work better than a fast one today, but I ended up carrying a very tired little fellow all the way home! </p>
<p>Doug was there promptly at 5 P.M. as we planned; he carried a sleeping Mirei up the stairs in the stroller... full tummy, plus nursing, plus fresh air equals sleeping baby. Off we dashed in heavy rush hour traffic over the Golden Gate bridge to Corte Madera to get decent seats at a book reading with Margaret Atwood. We lucked out and managed to get third row seats (the first two were reserved). She is a tiny woman and so interesting... witty, wise, and of course such a wonderful writer and reader too! We had an hour to wait for her, and I found a special event taking place at the used book store across the way; I had a glass of red wine and some St. Andre cheese with crackers... yum! and sat reading my own book until the reading at 7 P.M. Susan had seen her many years ago at university, but this was both Doug and my first reading with her and how pleased we were to finally see her read in person. </p>
<p>We grabbed burritos at "World Wrapps" before heading home, eating just half of them and saving the rest for lunch tomorrow. It was delicious... mine was grilled tofu strips, carrots, lots of broccoli, and terkyaki sauce with jasmine rice on a whole wheat tortilla. Yum! Kelly would have loved it; this particular chain moved out of SF before her last visit, much to her chagrin. </p>
<p>Home around 9 o'clock, watched a couple of taped shows, although I fell asleep while Doug kneaded my back for me during the last one. No problem; the show couldn't have been better than that back rub!</p>
<p>p.s. Mirei learned how to let herself down from a standing position today! She will stand for ages against a bed, the little kitchen, or mirrors, but go get down always lets out a little whine, indicating she needs help. However, today she was on the carpeted floor when I checked on her. So I stood her up again and just a minute later, bent those little legs, and ever so slowly lowered herself down. I gave her a big clap, she gave me a big smile, and she repeated this several times during the afternoon. Yay!</p>
