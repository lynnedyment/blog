								<h2>"Be Careful With That Hot Tea, Nana!"</h2>
								<p>Yes, Amelia's home! She and Susan arrived back from their eight day trip to Vancouver Island and Vancouver late last night. I wasn't sure if Amelia would be going to her nursery school this morning or not, but phoned last night, letting her parents know that I was looking forward to our regular Tuesday afternoon together. </p>
<p>Riku was indeed awake right on the nose at 6:30 this morning. We stayed in bed until 7 A.M., snuggling, hiding under the covers, pretending there were monsters "out there!", and cuddling some more. Riku always starts our day together by whispering our "nonsense" language softly near my face; it makes me smile every time, and he laughs when I come right back at him with the same. </p>
<p>He had some apple slices while sitting on Doug's lap watching the videos I took yesterday. I dashed upstairs to shower while they were busy with that, and then made Riku a big bowl of oatmeal with almonds and blueberries. Doug had made himself toast soon after and of course Riku wanted some. He ate a half a slice along with a full orange while he played with his big basket of toys set beside his "desk". I cannot believe how much he eats, now that he is really well. </p>
<p>We were organized enough this morning that Riku had some time in the back yard to water the garden with his little watering can, load more stones in the wheelbarrow, and do a little drawing with chalk at the front of the house before Bryn arrived for him. </p>
<p>Doug and I were both busy at the computers, but dashed off to San Mateo to pick up a free Graco booster seat which Amelia and Riku will be able to use once they reach 40 pounds and a certain height as well. I'm liking this freecycle group I joined last week, managing to donate a pair of shoes to someone who wears exactly the same size. </p>
<p>Amelia was all smiles when I picked her up from school; I got a nice big hug. And then the funniest thing happened... all the children were sitting at the table when I arrived, and as soon as the teacher left that area to get Amelia's sweater the children all started making a lot of noise. Amelia's first thought was that they were protesting that she was leaving so she walked over and announced, "It's okay children; I will be back another day" and as we went out the door she said to me, "Those children are very sad because I am leaving." </p>
<p>Amelia has a cold and a bad cough; poor wee boo. She coughed and coughed all the way home and was ready for bed as soon as she had a big drink of water. Doug had bought a children's book for her about the Sylvia Hotel where she and her mom always stay when in Vancouver; it's about a cat who moves in from the beach, and even though Amelia listened to each page, those little eyes were drooping. </p>
<p>I had the monitor on and Doug was amazed that she wasn't waking with each hard cough we heard; finally. after a half hour, she did awaken. I went in and lay with her for fifteen minutes, stroking her forehead and doing her pressure points as well. She was making little murmuring sounds and was soon asleep again, but twenty minutes later, at the hour mark exactly, she awoke and told me she was ready to get up. </p>
<p>We spent most of our time upstairs in the bedroom, as she wanted to ride the train with her babies... the snowmen she had taken up with before she went away. She had slept with the baby, and then we joined the mommy snowperson upstairs. Grandpa had to go up and put the train together but alas, the battery needed recharging. While they were busy with that, I made tea and took Amelia some yogurt upstairs. She was waiting at the top of the stairs for me, and as I started up, with my very full cup, Amelia said "Be careful with that hot tea, Nana!" I was, but she watched me the whole way up and to the bedroom. Since a train ride wasn't a possibility for the babies, instead we dressed and undressed them (I had put aside some wee socks and nighties for the dolls last weekend) and watched a "Little Bears" video of Bryn's and Caillie's. Amelia was sniffling away and coming over for periodic nose blowings. </p>
<p>At 3:30 we got ready for the playground; I had come across a sweet flowered denim vest of Caillie's and Amelia wore that on top of her pink top and striped pants. She looked adorable and the temperature was just perfect for the outfit; the sun was out and it was lovely, with a little breeze. </p>
<p>We had such a good time at the playground; she pushed me on the turnabout when we had a chance on it on our own. I sat on the edge with my feet up and Amelia really pushed to get me started. She reminded me to "hold on with two hands, Nana", and said it very seriously too ... such a little mother she is! I could tell she wasn't feeling quite up to par as she spent more time in the sandbox than usual, but had a little climbing time towards the end of our visit there. </p>
<p>Susan came by to pick her up at 5:15 or so, bearing gifts of course! I have two "Tea at the Empress" tins of tea and Bruni kindly tracked down some wool I really liked.. Susan brought back five big skeins of it for me... a lovely dark rich blue which is perfect with my winter coat. </p>
<p>Doug home from T'ai Chi bearing burritos, so we're off to watch a rented movie... more emailing later, no doubt, and bed... at the end of a busy and lovely afternoon with Amelia.</p>
