								<h2>Hot, Hot, Hot!</h2>
								<p>Whew! It is hot and muggy here, and quite a change from foggy San Francisco and dry Denver. I slept until 9:15, as it took quite a while to settle down with the house so hot last night. Once we awoke, we had the house shut up with blinds closed, but the front and back doors open for some light. The office and bedrooms were comfortable, but the kitchen and rec' room are chilly; hard to keep this house evenly heated/cooled. At one point Uncle Frank put his shoes on just, as he told me, to get the circulation going in his feet! </p>
<p>We had a busy day: after a light breakfast of cereal, toast, and juice, Uncle Frank busied himself with mail sorting, going through seven plus weeks of mail, flyers, bills, etc. He was also on the phone a lot as there are many projects around the house he wants to take care of before the fall.</p>
<p>While he was in his office with all of this, I unpacked my bags and his, did some laundry, pulling the sheets off Neal's bed as well, so his room is ready when he comes to visit, and generally got the house in order after all the time away. </p>
<p>I called Beth in the morning and had a long chat. It's hot at their new house with no air conditioning; I can't imagine how she is managing as she is used to having it and it really is so hot and humid out today. She plans to go in the pool for a while before going to work this afternoon. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank was hard at work in the office all afternoon, so I had some reading time in the living room... feet up, the house finally cooler, and I dozed a little too. In the late afternoon we finally left the house to run some errands, with a trip to the bank, the drugstore, the cleaners, and a final stop at "A Fine Kettle of Fish" for their Tuesday night special, a favourite of ours: one piece of fish with chips, all wrapped up in newspaper. This has a take-out special price of $4.99, and we enjoyed it at home, sitting in the cool kitchen. </p>
<p>Glenn and Wendy had called saying they would be over for a visit and bringing dessert with them. We had a lovely visit with them with tiny cheesecakes and tea; Glenn and Uncle Frank had chatted for a long time this morning as well, but I was glad to see him as I had called and been unable to leave a message. </p>
<p>After they left Uncle Frank got busy on the computer, so I made some phone calls... to Geraldine, Ian (whom I won't see until next week as he is off fishing on Friday), and Marie.</p>
<p>When Uncle Frank was finished on the computer, which is acting up and causing him no end of frustration, we settled, opened up the lovely port he had bought before he went away, and sat ... are you ready???... with a fire going in the rec' room for an hour. Actually, we turned the fireplace off after a half hour or so but Uncle Frank was feeling chilled, no doubt partly because he is tired and did a lot of sitting today as well. It was lovely to get back to our familiar quiet end to the evening.  </p>
<p>I had time to write to Virginia before heading off to bed at 12:15.</p>
