								<h2>An Amelia Afternoon...</h2>
								<p>I slept in until 8 A.M. today, much to my surprise. Doug headed off for the bus soon after that, I answered a few emails, and then called Judi Speirs for a long chat. She is off to Spain and Greece with Brooke in a few weeks; we caught up on lots of news but really need some one-on-one time to really catch up. We're hoping that might be in July. </p>
<p>Off to pick Amelia up at 12:20. She was disappointed it wasn't her mommy there to meet her, but was soon planning which "babies" she would sleep with for her nap. I knew she hadn't slept well yesterday afternoon or last night, and the teacher confirmed she was tired, so it was no surprise that she was asleep before I finished the first song. We did read two short books, "I Am a Bear" and "I Am a Mouse" though... it's a given. </p>
<p>Amelia slept for an hour and a half. I made a big bowl of miso soup with some veggies and tofu added to it, and sat going through a magazine while I ate. </p>
<p>Kelly IM'd from Savannah, Georgia while I was picking up Amelia. She and Gregg are there on a five-day trip she earned from Creative Memories. Kelly had just finished with the only training session of the trip, and she and Gregg were heading for the ocean in just a few minutes; she said it was hot hot hot there! </p>
<p>When Amelia woke I asked her if she would like a snack. With no hesitation at all she said "I would like a sausage" and told me cream cheese on toast when I offered her toast with that or butter. This girl knows what she wants. She made me laugh out loud when I agreed to go upstairs with her so she could give her babies a train ride; she looked at me and said "Nana, make some popcorn and tea and we will go up." This is just what I did on Tuesday afternoon with her! Doug always says she has a mind like a steel trap and I agree with him. Before we went upstairs though, Amelia did some finger painting and made three drawings, each designated: one for her mommy, one for her daddy, and one for me. Today she told me she had a very nice mommy, and a very nice daddy, and I was very nice too.  :) </p>
<p>She blesses me when I cough or sneeze, says "I see, Nana" after asking a question and being given an answer, but mostly she just has a certain grown up little attitude in the way she asks and answers questions. It's really adorable. This is a little girl who is very sweet with her babies too. After carefully tucking them in under the  pink heart blanket she uses here, she noticed one of them had his foot out. She immediately said "Oh, look, his foot is sticking out; it will get cold. I will cover him up." Murmuring away, she did just that. What a mom! </p>
<p>We sat upstairs and read about five books, including "A Big Ball of String" and a pop-up book, which she and Riku still enjoy very much. Amelia chose the first two and I chose the next three or four. Once they were done, and we had both finished our snacks, we were ready to head off to the park. </p>
<p>At 4 P.M. we were off to the playground; the sun had come up and the playground was busy! Just as we pulled up, Alexander, a special friend of Amelia's, was there in his stroller with his mom, Susan. They were delighted to see each other and went running off. Susan and I followed them about, both a little nervous about having them climbing so high on the rope dome, but of course they did it successfully, and were off to something else. </p>
<p>We had a nice chat together while they were busy with sand toys and the climbing structure. She has invited me to Alexander's third birthday party on Sunday at noon. Doug will be in Boston, but Susan and Amelia will of course be there, so I may join them for an hour. They're just a few blocks away from us. </p>
<p>Susan soon joined us, bringing me ribbon wrapped Canadian chocolate bars and Smarties for a little treat. Doug was very happy to see them when he got home! </p>
<p>Kelly had left another little message for me, saying they had a great day at the seaside, and were just back at 5 P.M. with a nice terry blue CM jacket for Kelly and a sage green non-CM sweatshirt for Gregg. They were going to meet "the gang" in half an hour in the hot tub. Sounds as though they are having a great time; what a wonderful trip this is for them. </p>
<p>Jody had called while I was out, so at 6 P.M. I called her and we chatted for twenty minutes or so. Her B&B is booking up nicely with rooms already reserved into September. I hope to see her in July as well, if Doug isn't fully booked with classes that month. </p>
<p>I also called Riku to say goodnight; he told me he was eating dinner... kabocha, carrots, rice, some noodles, and water. When I told him I would see him tomorrow and said I loved him, he ended the call by saying, "I love you very much too; see you tomorrow." ... and ending it with an over-the-phone kiss. </p>
<p>Bryn had tucked him in at home, after picking him up at 1 P.M., and it sounded as though that had gone successfully.  </p>
<p>I had arranged to pick Doug up at 7:10, after his T'ai Chi class, rather than have him deal with another night of waiting for the bus; it took him forty-five minutes of standing last night which meant a short evening at home. Tonight we also dashed to Trader Joe's for a few grocery items, had an Italian dinner at "Roccos", the place we ate brunch on Sunday. The food was fine, but a little salty and overpriced for what we had, and Safeway was our last stop on the way home. </p>
<p>Virginia wrote to say that Uncle Frank had had a very good day... another hour at Barnes and Noble, and despite a little pain was feeling well and was stronger. So good to hear... </p>
<p>We watched a taped TV show, Doug did his monthly invoice for work, I answered a few emails, and am ready to turn in, and read my new book from Susan. </p>
<p>Woke with a sore throat yesterday morning, it went away during the day, came back last night, and repeated the same thing today... arggh! Gargling with salt water and hoping to chase the bugs away.</p>
