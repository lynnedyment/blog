								<h2>A Busy Day and Dinner With By' and Jo'</h2>
								<p>I woke at 8:20 this morning; a full eight hours sleep feels very good after the past few busy days. UF had set his alarm for 8:30, something I hope to talk him out of soon. However, he showered and after breakfast of poached eggs, turkey bacon for UF, juice, and tea, he was once again busy in his office, today going through over 200 emails and deleting lots of jokes, and junk emails as well. </p>
<p>I spent the time transferring UF's summer clothes into his room and moving the heavier winter clothes out. I did a couple of loads of laundry so that everything is ready for him in the fall when the cold weather arrives. </p>
<p>The time flew by again today, although with UF in the office I am getting behind in emails and blogging. I am keeping notes until his busy time is over, and meanwhile am plowing through my latest book faster than I have in months! It's quite a pleasure to sit in the living room, all caught up with the tasks I had set for myself, dozing off a bit and reading.</p>
<p>We had lunch at home at 1 P.M. and, wanting to stay close to Virginia's light but tasty meal plans, we shared a can of mushroom soup, made with half water and half 2% milk, a few California pistachios for dessert, and some hot tea.</p>
<p>Midday I took one of Jo's delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies into the office for Uncle Frank, with a glass of juice. </p>
<p>We had planned to go out this afternoon to buy fresh produce, and a few groceries, but waited in for a fellow coming to see about the eaves troughs. We had hoped he would be here at 3:30 but he didn't make it until after 5:30. No visit to Beth's and Paul's new house once again, as various tradespeople were around today. I'm amazed at how much UF has managed to get done in these two days since arriving home.</p>
<p>We had the AC working all night, and decided to turn it off this morning; it was 69F in the house when we woke, and so with the fan blowing and the outside air heating up, we were much more comfortable than yesterday. </p>
<p>We had been invited to By' and Jo's for dinner tonight; we set off at 6 P.M. and dinner was on the table just a few minutes after we arrived. Lesley was there with us, and we had a delicious dinner and a nice evening with them... grilled chicken, green salad, potato salad, mashed potatoes, whole wheat bread, and a tasty asparagus and mixed vegetable assortment. Dessert was low-fat vanilla ice-cream with strawberries and blueberries atop a small shortcake. We had homemade strawberry wine with dinner and tea before leaving for home around 9:30. </p>
<p>The A&P grocery store, just over the bridge from UF's, is open 24 hours a day, so off we went for our groceries. We picked up two lots of already prepared frozen fish... breaded tilapia, wild salmon in dill sauce, lots of fresh fruit, and a few canned goods as well. </p>
<p>I got everything unpacked while Uncle Frank checked his emails; he was having trouble with the computer so was ready to take his break with a glass of port in the recreation room. This will seem hard to believe but it was cool enough down there that UF turned on the fireplace for fifteen minutes until we were both comfortable. We sat and chatted for a long time but still managed to get to bed before midnight. </p>
<p>Candy arrives tomorrow!</p>
