								<h2>Ahhhhh!</h2>
								<p>I had booked a massage for this morning at 10 A.M., with Tricia, the most wonderful massage therapist at the Kabuki Spa. This was a combined Christmas gift from Kelly, Gregg, and Doug. It was a great massage and I was relieved to hear from her that I have very tight muscles in my side waist area; it's not a kidney problem as I have suspected. And it makes sense as I often carry the children with that hip jutting out; must learn not to do that and to get back to my stretching exercises too. She did a great job with me, and I was a mere puddle walking into the bath area; I soaked in the hot water twice, did a nice salt scrub in the steam room after I had lain there for twenty minutes, and had a leisurely sit in the sauna while I conditioned my hair. All in all, it was just what I needed... </p>
<p>I picked Riku up at 1 P.M. and we ran into Sophia's mom for the first time; I told her Riku quite liked Sophia, and she said that perhaps he could come over to play one day. I knew Riku was a very tired boy when he instantly said, "I don't want to do that"; even when we reassured him it wasn't to be today, he emphasized very clearly that he wasn't interested. He drank all his soy milk, was very quiet, and I really had to work at keeping him awake. Poor little guy; those eyes were so heavy and he finally just gave into it, just as I reached the garage door! I carried him upstairs, undressed him, sat him on the toilet and lay him down. By this time he was awake enough that he wanted a story; a very abridged version of "Love you Forever" was just fine. Riku was asleep within two minutes of lying down. </p>
<p>I ate some lovely fruity bread I had picked up at the bakery near the school, made some tea, and answered a few emails. Riku slept for just over two hours, although wakened twice very briefly. He was still not himself when he woke; usually he is ready with a big giggle within minutes of waking, wanting to snuggle first, but today he didn't want to do anything... no play-doh, no magnets, no painting, no building, no playground. He was happy lying in my arms, covered up with his spotted blanket, so I finally suggested going upstairs and watching Pingu. </p>
<p>He sat on the stairs waiting for me to make a snack for us; normally he would have gone up to wait, and played until I got there. He had some veggie & noodle soup, strawberries, and a half slice of Grandpa's special bread. He was a hungry boy, even though he had eaten all his lunch. Instead of Pingu he decided to watch "Curious George", a tape he hadn't seen before from Bryn and Caillie. It was just what he needed; we sat side by side, and before long he was laughing out loud at George's mischievous behavior and chatting away happily. </p>
<p>I ran down at one point to put some laundry in the dryer, and as I left Riku called out "Oh, come back! Keep me company or I will be lonely." I assured him I would be just a minute and kept my promise. He was playing with the blocks and farm animals by this time, and we recreated "The Farmer in the Dell" using many of the plastic and wooden human and animal figurines. Too bad we don't have a mouse and some cheese, but we pretended and had them all fall down at the end. Lots of fun. </p>
<p>We ended our day together by going outside with the chalk to wait for his dad to pick him up. The nice man with the little dog we see frequently on our street came by to say hello; Riku pointed out the sign for the lost cat and they talked about that, and then Riku let his dog sniff his hand. Riku knows how to carry on a conversation, and will initiate one with strangers. They waved goodbye to each other and Riku said as he left, "See you another day!" </p>
<p>Bryn pulled up about fifteen minutes later, with an almost asleep but still smiling Mirei in the back seat. She and her mom had been at the studio all day, and Bryn had dropped Akane off at home. Riku was happy to see Mirei and took her hand as soon as he was in his own car seat. </p>
<p>I had made cauliflower soup for dinner, and it was ready as Doug walked in the door. We've lost our warm weather; it was foggy all morning and quite cloudy all afternoon, although the sun peeked out for a bit in the late afternoon. I'm so glad we took advantage of the beach weather and went! </p>
<p>Read through a magazine after dinner, and then got busy cleaning all the kitchen counters thoroughly; the house next door is under construction and things are dustier than usual. Too tired to watch a movie tonight, and was pleased to get something accomplished today.</p>
