								<h2>A Boy... and a Blue Bow...</h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 7 A.M. today, convincing me to stay in bed with him so we could snuggle and hide under the covers. Mouse and Skippy the dog hid too, as we could hear Grandpa come down the stairs. Riku had his finger to his lips, and the animals kept perfectly quiet, but Riku's giggling drew Doug to the room, where he whipped off the covers and discovered us!</p>
<p>We only had an hour before he was picked up for school, but we packed a lot into that time... more hiding, apples and strawberries as he drew, and play time with both his Easter containers. He loves to open all the plastic eggs and rediscover what is in them; today the blue silly putty was a hit. At one point, he asked me for his new placemat and the pinwheel; I wondered why he wanted both, but soon found him on the chesterfield with the same items in the green plastic pail, as were in on Easter morning (two stuffed toys and a few candies), and the basket filled with the chocolate and plastic eggs. What a memory he has! </p>
<p>Riku asks lately "So, what are we doing today Nana?" This must come from Bryn, filling him in on school days or weekends. I told him that his dad was picking him up for school and that his dad was picking him up after lunch too. He knew that Amelia would be here for her nap and that maybe we would meet after his nap. I remember Taryn Speirs wanting to know all the details of her day at this age, though not all children do... interesting that Riku does as well.</p>
<p>After eating a great breakfast... hot cereal with mixed fruit, and a half slice of Doug's special apple-cinnamon bread, we spent some time "hiding" in dark places so he could use the tiger flashlight Gail and Tom gave him for his birthday. He loves to pretend there is something scary in the space (the storage room today) and then "discover" that it in only a light fixture instead. Today, however, he took it one step further and first pretended it was a bat, and we had to scurry on out of there really fast.</p>
<p>At one point this morning Riku said "Buenos dios, Nana". He said this yesterday in the car too; apparently his daddy is teaching a bit of a third language too.</p>
<p>Doug left for work downtown on the 8:15 bus again today. Looks like another gorgeous day out there.</p>
<p>Bryn picked Riku up right at 8:35, after I promised him I wouldn't put anything away upstairs in our bedroom. He was working hard on a structure when Bryn pulled up. He had a "special present" for Riku, which he told him about on the phone, so Riku was keen to go down to the car and check it out... a long plastic handle with a "pincher" on the end of it. Grinning from ear to ear he happily waved me goodbye.</p>
<p>I puttered away the morning, as is so easy for me to do... emails, tidying, and folding the last bit of laundry, eating, etc. and left the house at 12:10 to pick up Amelia. She looked like spring this afternoon in a sweet pair of pastel-striped overalls, a soft white long sleeved T-shirt and with the perkiest and prettiest of blue bows in her little "whale spout". Susan ties the tidiest of bows. I had sung "Farmer in the Dell" to her on Friday morning, and on the way home she started singing bits of it to me. I'm sure she will know it all the way through on her own in no time at all.</p>
<p>After ten minutes of drawing time with the timer running, Amelia decided she was hungry after all. Funny how this happens when bedtime is announced! :)  With Riku, it is always a drink. However, despite having a good lunch of chicken noodle soup at school, she did eat an entire container of yogurt, which will hold her nicely through her nap. I read the Mr. Dressup book to her, as I had told her a bit about the story on the way home from school. She dropped off before I finished singing our three familiar songs and slept from 1:30- 3:15, a nice long nap for her here.</p>
<p>I made tea and popcorn, and we went upstairs so Amelia could ride the train again. She had a real blanket for her "babies" today, the pair of stuffed snowman dolls, and cooed away at them... "There you go baby, all nice and cozy" and "Have a good nap, we're going for a train ride now" while tucking them snugly into the caboose. I read while she rode and we chatted back and forth about noises from the house renovating going on next door... they make Amelia nervous, and she would jump up on the bed with the caboose each time she heard some strange noise. It turned out that the noise we were hearing was a signal from the train letting us know that it was still turned on! </p>
<p>At one point, while Amelia was on the train, humming away busily to herself, I asked her "How are you doing, Miss Conductor?" Amelia turned to me very solemnly and responded "I am not a conductor; I am a mommy." </p>
<p>Later, as I was going down the stairs with my arms full of purse, hat, jacket, keys, and garage opener, Amelia looked up at me and said in her very serious Amelia tone of voice "Be very careful Nana; stairs are very dangerous." I was very careful.</p>
<p>At 4 P.M. we headed for the playground; it was a perfectly sunny day with just enough breeze so that it wasn't too hot there. We sat in both sandboxes for the longest time, and then Susan arrived, and then Akane with Riku and Mirei too! What a treat to see them walk in the gate; Riku hadn't napped, unfortunately, so was a little grumbly but mostly okay. He was happy playing with Amelia and Alexander in the sandbox for a bit and then he went off on his own while they both climbed the dome of rope ladders. Amelia is as comfortable as can be, climbing higher and higher; it makes me nervous to watch her, so Susan came and took over. Alexander, the little boy from Amelia's nursery school got to the top too, but was a little leery of climbing down. He did it though...</p>
<p>Riku and I stayed until 6:15, and then I drove him home; Akane had walked home a half hour earlier with Mirei. Bryn told me Riku was a little sad when I wasn't there to pick him up after school; I assured him tonight that I would be there tomorrow. He blew kisses and went upstairs happily with Akane and Mirei, who had come down to meet us at the door.</p>
<p>Susan wrote to say they stayed at the park until 6:40, and that Amelia had had a great time with Alexander; she sent a sweet photo of the two of them sitting together in his stroller.</p>
<p>Watched a taped show while eating a bowl of fruit, and then watched a movie with Doug from 8-10 P.M. Kelly is off to Savannah, Georgia tomorrow morning with Gregg; sent her an email, and answered a couple of others before heading off with the gift of a new book from Susan! Lucky me...</p>
