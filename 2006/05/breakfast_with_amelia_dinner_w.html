								<h2>Breakfast with Amelia; Dinner with Riku & Mirei... and parents too!</h2>
								<p>Susan, Kevin, and Amelia had invited us out for a farewell (for me) breakfast this morning; we met at the "Bagdad Cafe" on Market Street at 9:10. Amelia was in fine spirits with not a sign of her cough, but she is still fighting it at night and at nap times. I had my usual... two eggs, home fries, and toast; Kevin had potato pancakes served between regular pancakes(!); Susan and Amelia shared bacon, eggs, and toast; and Doug had a fried egg sandwich with two different cheeses on sourdough toast. Yum! </p>
<p>Before being served, I had time to trace out animal magnets on paper for Amelia; she chose the colours and I did the tracing. Later, she, Kevin, and Doug rolled a small car back and forth across the table, complete with jam container "bridges" and a napkin tunnel, to make the exercise more interesting. Kevin took her off outside while Susan drank her coffee and I finished my tea. After hugs and kisses all 'round, with a specially long one for Amelia from me, we said our goodbyes for a month. I know I am going to miss out on some new phrases and comments during that time, but Susan has promised to send pictures and I will check with her blog to see what they are up to in my absence. </p>
<p>The Joseph Schmidt chocolate shop was just down the street, so I stopped to pick up a box of twelve for Virginia and Joe. I was then lucky enough to get in for a hair cut with Bing, my favourite hairdresser in Noe Valley. We came right home and I spent the afternoon putting away the children's riding train from our room, tidying up Riku's books, running the vacuum around once more, and emailing. There was time for tea and a little reading too, before heading off for dinner at 4:45 with Akane, Bryn, Mirei, and Riku (who drove with us). </p>
<p>I had taken along our usual few books, but with a surprise as well. Riku said "Oh! We have another new book today! Why?" Doug had bought "The Giant Turtle", a story based on a Buddhist story of the world, so we read that on the way to the restaurant, as well as "Koko's Kitten" and a book about jellyfish. </p>
<p>Riku was not quite himself; Bryn said he was a bit out of sorts as they were leaving to come over, and he complained of being too warm in the car with us, even with lots of fresh air blowing in, enough so that I was cold. He was fine once we got to the restaurant; he polished off a whole orange and some carrots while waiting for our pizza, and had no trouble eating his one piece. I think we need to order more than one extra large next time we are all together, as he would have eaten more, I think. </p>
<p>Mirei was the object of much attention while we were waiting for our table at "Gaspare's" on Geary Avenue. A friendly woman told us that her daughter had had cheeks just like Mirei's; she said they disappeared once she started to roll over, so we shall see if that holds true for Mirei once she is at that stage. </p>
<p>The pizza was delicious, Bryn's favourite so far, and I think mine too. I loved the sauce on last week's pizza but this crust was much better and I like a good crust! Riku and an older girl in the booth behind us entertained each other before and after our pizza arrived; she would make faces and eyes at Riku and he loved it. </p>
<p>Riku had overheard Doug telling Bryn that "Bud's Ice Cream Parlour", just two blocks down the street from the pizza place, had won the "city's best" award this year. He was the one who suggested we have "Ice cream for dessert? That is a good idea!" and so off we went. Riku had a small taste of "bubblegum", which ended up immediately in my hand.. I took one look at that face and knew he didn't want to swallow it... so he had vanilla, Bryn chose vanilla with blueberries, Akane had one of the ripples I believe, I had coconut... my very favourite, and Doug had fudge ripple. Riku asked each person in turn, as they came from the counter "What kind you are having?" He had a spoonful of mine and liked it a lot, but ate his way very nicely through his small cup very neatly and efficiently. Mirei sat in her car seat beside us on the floor, smiling at whomever looked her way.</p>
<p>Doug found a couple of good CDs at Amoeba Records in the Haight on the way home while I read in the car, and then we watched a couple of taped short TV shows... a documentary on "craigslist" and an Oprah episode on "amazing kids" ... and they were! </p>
<p>We both sat at our computers for almost two hours before going to bed. Doug added the first photos in a long while to a blog entry, we looked at the pics taken last night, and I answered some emails. I'm not down to the bottom of my list yet, as I had hoped to be, but if all goes well tomorrow... </p>
<p>Bed at 1 A.M. ... too late.</p>
