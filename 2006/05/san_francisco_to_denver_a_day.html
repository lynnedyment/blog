								<h2>San Francisco to Denver... a Day Early!</h2>
								<p>I woke bright and early this morning and got a good head start on my day, answering lots of emails and writing up blogs I had made notes on. I got so much accomplished, had a quick breakfast, and picked Riku up for the Carnival parade at 10 A.M. as planned. Bryn, Akane, and Mirei were heading out to Hayes Valley to a street fair, and I suggested they take their time and stay out over Riku's naptime, as he could nap at our place. My day was all planned: while Riku napped, I would gather all my trip items for Doug to pack for me and I would clear out the fridge, water the plants, and finish up my few emails. I had a quiet evening planned with Doug; we would watch a movie early after dinner at home, and get to bed at a decent hour for my 9:15 flight tomorrow. I wouldn't have to get up until 6:30 which was fine. </p>
<p>Well, we had a grand time at the parade. Riku loved it all; he sat on Doug's shoulders part of the time, mesmerized by the colourful costumes, the dancing, and the music. He sat on a mat with some small children next to us and was thrilled when he had candy thrown his way... a mini Tootsie Roll, two mints, and a tiny vanilla-flavoured Tootsie Roll. He kept switching between holding them in his hand and putting them in his shirt pocket. He was wearing a new cotton shirt and looked adorable; Bryn said he was the cutest kid in the Mission and I think he might have been right! </p>
<p>Riku asked if he could have some of his candy; it was still morning, but it was a special day, so I gave him a tiny piece, which he chewed and chewed away on. I had taken along a slice of toast for Riku, and he agreed to eat all of that before having any more candy; he is so good about this kind of thing and it surprises me each time. </p>
<p>After the other family left, he sat on the curb or stood holding on to the rails, peeking through at all that was going on. His two biggest parade offerings were a small ball that one of the dancers gave him, and two shiny necklaces I managed to catch for him. We stayed for an hour and a half, with Riku thrilled with it all. </p>
<p>Off we went to Rainbow to buy sourdough bread for Brynnie, the rest of the Toronto family (Bryn had asked for his own loaf this time; he told me he would pay for it when I came), and a loaf for Virginia and Joe.</p>
<p>And now my day got interesting... I had tucked Riku into bed and the phone rang soon after that. It was Virginia, Uncle Frank's sister in Denver, wondering where I was! Egad! I was supposed to be in Denver! Right then! They had been to the airport to pick me up, and when I never arrived assumed that somehow they had missed me, and that I had taken a limo to their house. Nope! I was enjoying what I thought was my last day in San Francisco. </p>
<p>This was the very first time I hadn't entered my flights in my calendar; in my head I knew I was flying on the holiday Monday, and I was... but from Denver to Toronto, not to Denver! Oh my!</p>
<p>First things first...  I called the airline and with much help and co-operation from the folks at United managed to get standby seats on the 5:03 flight. I had two hours to get to the airport, so we all went into action. Doug pulled out the suitcases and put all the things I have been gathering together for the trip on the bed to pack for me. I called Virginia and told her when I would really arrive, and then called Akane to suggest that Bryn be at the house by 3 P.M. to pick up Riku or stay while he napped.</p>
<p>All went beautifully, thanks to everyone... Doug did all my packing and made me a cheese sandwich for the flight, Bryn brought Mirei over and lay her on the bed to entertain us while we packed and organized my bag; she is such a smiley little girl, and provided me with many happy snuggly moments while we did this. She was cooing away at Doug and I had time to take some photos of her holding on to her feet while spreading them out in opposite directions. Bryn dashed off to pick up a bottle of port from Brent for Uncle Frank and me, while Akane was at home kindly making me my favourite noodles with veggies, and my very favourite inari and some carrots for the flight. Bryn cut up the last of the celery for me, as I knew Doug wouldn't bother with it. </p>
<p>Riku woke up just before 3 P.M. and I went into him and told him I was leaving today. He put his arms around my neck and held me for the longest time; we had some quality snuggling time before I had to finish up the last of organizing my carryon bag. </p>
<p>Two hours after my call from Virginia, I was on my way to the airport. Bryn and Riku came with us, and we said our goodbyes as I went through security. I went to a cafe and had a very tall cup of hot tea, and ate one of my delicious inari. I had missed lunch in the rush and was happy to sit and take my time eating and enjoying my tea. </p>
<p>There was lots of room on the plane, and I had a set of three seats all to myself. I dozed a little during a boring movie, read the airline magazine, and two hours later arrived in Denver. Virginia and I spotted each other at the same time with no difficulty at all. And Kelly's right; Uncle Frank does look like Virginia with wig on! We had some laughs about the mix-up today, and I was grateful that I was able to get the flight which arrived at 8:30 and not the one at 11 P.M. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank looks very well; he is slim and standing straighter than ever before. He looks very relaxed too, and it was lovely to see him tanned and smiling, waiting for me to come over to him. </p>
<p>We drove the twenty-five minutes or so to their home, admired the crescent moon in the clear sky, and chatted away over tea and biscuits until 11:15... fifteen minutes past their normal bedtime. It was a lovely relaxing end to what had started off as a lovely and relaxing morning!</p>
