								<h2>The Weekend's Coming Up!</h2>
								<p>Ah, the luxury of just rolling over and going back to sleep. I did it again today, burrowing under the duvet, blocking out the sunshine, in order to have seven hours sleep under my belt today. Eight A.M. is usually late for me, but I wasn't about to get out of bed at my usual 6:30 this morning! </p>
<p>I spent three hours sitting at the computer, dashing off emails as quickly as they came in, Skyping with Kelly, and IMing with Bryn and Kelly. Finally, at 11 A.M. I dashed up to shower, ate my breakfast, read the paper, and prepared both snacks and a mid-afternoon mini-meal for Riku, in case we have some beach time after his dermatology appointment. </p>
<p>I was at his school right at 12:30, a half hour early, to make sure he had enough of a nap that the appointment would not be difficult for him. A happy boy came running to the door, carrying the sweetest Mothers' Day calendar for his mom. He had drawn the face on and did an amazing job, with two eyes, a smile, and straight black but short hair. Bryn told me later that when he dropped him off this morning it was hanging on the wall along with all the others and two mothers told him he had to look at Riku's as it was so amazing! </p>
<p>He was asleep by 12:45, and I drove right to Ocean Beach; he didn't budge, and slept soundly while I read more of the book Susan gave me last week: "To Hell with All That" by Caitlin Flanagan. Susan introduced me to her writing, and saves any columns she comes across for me. It's non-fiction... witty, interesting, and well-written. It was sheer bliss to sit and watch the waves roll in, with the sun shining and enough of a breeze to keep it comfortable. </p>
<p>At 2 o'clock I left the beach and headed for Divisidero Street, finding a free parking spot in the shade. Riku had to be gently roused at 2:40 (the appointment was at 2:30 but I had phoned and found out we had a half hour grace period), and I carried a still dozy little fellow to the building. At that point though, he was just fine; pushed the button for the elevator, chatted with the man inside sharing the ride with us, showing him the sore spot on his wrist. Guess he was practicing for what he was going to show the doctor. </p>
<p>Bryn must have been talking about the visit, as Riku said he was going to see a "super doctor" and she was going to give him "super cream". Riku has two eczema spots that just won't stay healed; one on the inside of his right wrist, and one on the front of his right ankle. The little joining spots near Riku's earlobes are an occasional problem, as well as the occasional break-outs on his arms, legs, and buttocks. It is 99% better since he was a very young baby, but we would all like to see it gone once and for all! </p>
<p>Riku was measured and weighed before the doctor saw him; he is an "old pro", the assistant told him, as he stood on the big scale and backed up against the ruler... 33 pounds and 37 inches. Dr. Seigal is a young doctor, and was very thoughtful with Riku. He showed her all his spots, and even pulled down his underwear so she could see a red spot that bothers him at times! He will be using a stronger cortisone cream on the bad spots which should clear it up, and lots of moisturizers to keep the rest of his skin looking good. </p>
<p>Riku continues to be so sociable with strangers when we are out together. He showed a woman in the waiting room his wrist and told her the doctor was going to give him special cream for it, and when he spotted a large baby in a back carrier in the waiting room he told the dad, "Oh, I have a baby like that at my home! But she is different. She is a girl baby and she is little." </p>
<p>On the way out, the elevator button wouldn't turn red when I pushed it. Riku thought it was broken but he pushed it twice, hard, so when it opened, he told the man already inside that he had "fixed the elevator" and continued the conversation all the way down to the lobby and to the door. He even asked the man, "What that green thing is in your mouth?" and when told it was gum, said "Oh, I see. Nana, that green thing is gum!" He waved goodbye to everyone he spoke to or passed on the street on the way back to the car. </p>
<p>We talked about which playground we would go to, and whether he wanted to go home or to the airport to pick Doug up. Of course he chose the latter. On the way there though he sang "The Farmer in the Dell" straight through and in tune, with little inflections making it sound ever so sweet. He does love to sing, that boy, and I must expand my repertoire of songs. There are so many I haven't sung to him or Amelia and they learn the new ones so quickly.</p>
<p>Off we went to the playground near his home; he ate two bananas (his and mine!) at the doctor's office, and then some banana bread in the car. He must be in a growth spurt right now, as I often find myself feeling like a mother bird, keeping him filled up at his request. "Do you have a snack?" or "I need a snack now" or "Do you have some soy milk?" </p>
<p>It was fairly quiet again today at the playgound, and Riku happily wandered about, with no sitting in the sandbox at all today. Lately he has been most happy climbing up on the playhouse structure with both hands filled with buckets, and various bits he has found in the rest of the playground... little scraps of paper, a plastic spoon, a special stone, sticks of course(!) and anything sparkly. Lately there seem to be colourful tiny plastic balls around the area, which are always a big hit. </p>
<p>We came home for an hour before heading off to the airport to pick up Doug. Riku watched a Pingu video, while I fed him some noodle and veggie soup and the rest of the yogurt he had started at the doctor's office. Interestingly, he insisted we watch the last episode that makes him a little nervous, the same one that his cousin Bryn didn't like either. It's a bad dream sequence and neither of them, nor Amelia, like the walrus with his big teeth. But he said we would watch it together and we decided again today that really he is just a funny guy, and not really scary. He wanted to know today though what a dream really was... and we talked about why his mom and dad were not in the dream with Pingu. </p>
<p>Just before drifting off to sleep on Monday night Riku asked me "What is a dream?" and I told him they were thoughts in his head, like a movie. I imagine more and more questions will come to him. </p>
<p>Doug's flight was due in a half hour later than scheduled, so at 6:45 we left for the airport. We were there for only a few minutes before Riku, crouching down and looking up the escalator, spotted his Grandpa. Well, the squeals and big smiles got him lots of big smiles from the assembled crowd, as he ran to give Doug a big hug. He and I had had fun on the moving sidewalk on the way in, walking backwards on it, and running carefully too. Grandpa pretended he was a big monster which was very exciting and we managed to escape! </p>
<p>Sure enough, on the way home Riku wanted more snacks; I had cut up a big navel orange just in case, so that went down well, but I didn't have the toast he requested, or the bagel with cream cheese either. I had had that with me earlier but hadn't anticipated him needing more after the big bowl of soup and the rest of the yogurt! Where <strong>is</strong> he putting it all? </p>
<p>Doug took Riku upstairs, with Riku all set to present his mommy with her card. Doug said Bryn answered the door, so Riku said "Happy Mothers' Day!" but went dashing off to give it to Akane in the kitchen when he realized that he had the wrong person! </p>
<p>Home to tidy up after the quick dash out of the house so early this afternoon... made a hot cup of tea, answered some emails, and will head up now to join Doug who is reading before he turns out the light. He's tired, having been up since 6:45 A.M. in New York and it now being 1:30 body time.</p>
