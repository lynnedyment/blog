								<h2>Seven Days To Denver!</h2>
								<p>Awoke this morning feeling like I'm getting down to the wire; only one week from today I shall be on my way to Denver. Hard to imagine! </p>
<p>I slept in again; how very strange this seems to me, as I never used to sleep much past 7 A.M. and lately it's been much later. I emerged at 8:30 again this morning. I guess I can get away with a late night now and then, but not these consistently late hours I've been keeping lately... and Doug too. </p>
<p>Of course this means I have less time to do the things I can only do in the mornings, so today is a catch up day for sure... or that was the plan. Bryn called to say that he had to be in the office all day today, and that Akane would be home alone with the children. I suggested that she walk over here at noon with them, and Riku could have his nap here. Doug is really busy with a deadline, and thought it would be best if Riku weren't here for quite such a long time, wanting some attention from him. So, plans changed and we were to meet in the playground instead; Riku could have some running around time, and I would drive over to pick him up for his nap. </p>
<p>Plans changed again. Mirei napped longer than was expected, so I walked over to Hampshire Street at 12:45, and Riku and I had a nice slow walk home, except when we were taking turns chasing each other, and running and hiding once we hit the condos with their convenient hiding places at the doors. It is such a joy to see Riku running again, without stopping to cough! It seems that is all behind us for good. </p>
<p>Riku wanted some playtime before his nap, and so I made him a snack of cheese bites, a half a slice of Grandpa's "special" toast (cinnamon and apple bread), and half of a banana with his vanilla soy milk to drink. He ate every bite, and downed the milk too, while I read him his newest book "The Little Engine Who Could". He liked it a lot and said "Oh, I remember this book! We didn't see it for a long time!" and now I'm wondering if we didn't need to order it, as perhaps Kelly and Bryn's old copy is around here somewhere. </p>
<p>Once Riku finished eating he said to me, "Riku is tired. I want to go to bed now." We read "Drummer Hoff", a short story and one of his Daddy's books, before I tucked him; he was sound asleep in just minutes, curled up with "Skippy". It had rained hard while he was eating, and I opened his window a bit to let that sound and moisture seep into the room. Riku napped for close to an hour and forty-five minutes, crying out just once in a dream "Don't come in here. Don't come in here!" </p>
<p>Riku loves to stay in bed and cuddle these days. I go in to him when he has awakened close to when he should be up anyway, turn off the sound machine and lie beside him, as he wraps his arms around my neck and pulls me in tight to him. I start to make quiet little murmuring sounds in his neck then; he burrows in deeper, but eventually comes out with some silliness, usually our pretend language. This never fails to make him laugh, and then we hid under his soft blue blanket, calling out loud enough for Doug to hear on the monitor to come and find us. Riku just cannot <strong>not</strong> giggle! It is so funny to lie there with his face right next to mine and see that face start to squint and curl up in delight, before the laughter comes bursting out. He shrieks every time Doug throws the cover off us... and then the pillow fight starts. What a guy!</p>
<p>Riku checked out a few bugs outside when he got up; not sure if he liked being out in the wet with his bare feet, especially when he saw some hardbacked bugs all gathered together. </p>
<p>Bryn said he would come by asap, so I took Riku his snack (a small bowl of porridge with almonds, and a whole orange in segments) upstairs, while we played with the blocks and made a train. Bryn came by to get him around 5 P.M. ("Don't put away these things, okay? Just leave them. I will be back.") and they left not much later for a trip to a computer store. </p>
<p>A funny thing happened when Bryn came upstairs to see us. It was obvious that Riku knew Bryn was standing behind him at the door, but he didn't look around. Bryn kept saying "Riku, look at me!" but with a smirk on his face, Riku just ignored him, concentrating, or at least pretending to, on his blocks. So Bryn came out with "Riku! Look at me! I have hair now!" and Riku whipped his head around so fast that Bryn said it was a good thing he wasn't wearing glasses, or they would hav flown off his face! It was very funny! </p>
<p>I managed to get all the laundry and ironing done today so no Monday wash day tomorrow...  </p>
<p>Beth's online! Yahoo! </p>
<p>I was really hungry today for some reason, so made a quick tomato sauce with some added homemade pesto, cooked up a generous portion of whole wheat pasta, made a simple salad and we were finished dinner at 6:15 tonight, much earlier than we've been eating lately. </p>
<p>Doug continued working and I went upstairs with my tea to finish off a  tape of Oprah shows... and I've been writing emails, completing blogs, and just realized that it's 1:20 A.M.! Off I go to bed as Doug expects he will be up until 3 a.m. perhaps, finishing up the latest teaching manual. </p>
<p>Night, night... and Happy Birthday Kimmie, who is 43 today!</p>
