								<h2>Into the Second Week in Ontario Already!</h2>
								<p>Time sure does fly when you're having fun, and I seem to have fun wherever I am. It's hard to believe seven days have passed since Uncle Frank and I arrived in the Falls. We've accomplished so much and we hope to get lots more done in the next three weeks. </p>
<p>I awoke at 9:30 today; UF slept until 11:30. He doesn't like sleeping this late but he obviously needs it. Hot cereal for breakfast this morning with fruit, toast, and tea. </p>
<p>We headed out the door at 1 P.M. to run a few errands, but didn't finish up completely before heading home to meet up with Jessyca at 2 o'clock. She is giving her grandad some advice on paint colours for his bedroom walls, and trim in the office. They had a little visit before I joined them; when she left at 2:45, we set off to get UF's hair cut at the Five Corners. I found a celery green linen blouse at "Winner's" while waiting for him.</p>
<p>Off to St. Catherines then; I dropped UF off at "Chapters" so he could do some browsing and walking around, as he did in Denver for exercise, and I went next door to Costco for household supplies, and specifically to buy camisoles, one of the two things I forgot to pack in my rush to Denver. An hour later I joined UF, he bought a book, and we were home to unpack and have dinner by 6 P.M. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank enjoyed his dinner so much; he thanked me two or three times for it during the evening. We had baked lemon-crusted tilapia (ready to pop in the oven; I still don't handle raw fish), sauteed swiss chard, a cob of delicious corn, and caprese salad, his very first. He liked it so much, and we still have lots of the tiny balls of soft cheese for many more meals. </p>
<p>We were reading at the table after dinner... UF his new book, and I finishing the morning paper, when I started working on the crossword in the paper. It was very rewarding to get three or four words immediately and not take that long for one of the NY Times words; UF joined me and we spent perhaps an hour finishing it up. We were stumped on one small corner of the puzzle but finally got it done. Yahoo! That took care of our puzzle for the evening. </p>
<p>UF went online to choose a painting for his room and to make arrangements to have it made into a poster; he has chosen a Van Gogh painting.</p>
<p>Candy called and we had a very long chat about her day and plans for the coming week. She will be here tomorrow afternoon while Beth is at work. </p>
<p>It was a good day today since I heard from most of the family. To start, I had a long newsy email from Kelly. Myk' and Bryn are at the music camp in Orillia; both of them were two of a very small number of students from within the Toronto School Board to be chosen to go. They will be home on Saturday. This will be an exciting and unique week for them. Kelly and Gregg had a great day on Sunday with just Bry' and Caillie, a day at Ontario place while the others were at camp. </p>
<p>Amelia wrote again today; what fun this is, as I can send her off a little email each time in response. Susan has been great about sending off photos, so I can see that little face and share her with UF. </p>
<p>Bryn called through on Skype and we also talked for a long time, talking about taking Riku to B.C. with us (Doug and me) if and when we go this summer. Mirei was sitting on Bryn's lap as we talked and ended up dropping off to sleep! </p>
<p>I could hear Riku chattering away in the background and Bryn put the headphones on him, so it was a little easier to hear him. He asked me at one point if I was coming home soon. Hard to know what "soon" is in his mind. </p>
<p>All is well there; Bryn is picking him up from school and Riku naps in the car. Riku told me he liked the movie they saw on the weekend (with Kevin, Amelia, and his dad: "Over the Hedge") and it was so good to hear his little voice filling me in on what he has been doing. We sang a little together before he had to go to bed... a couple of verses from "Old MacDonald, and finishing up with a few lines from "There's a Hole in the Bottom of the Sea". </p>
<p>UF was busy writing emails during this time, so after reading for a bit in the kitchen, I just took his port up to him, and sat down to read in the living room with mine. I guess he was feeling a little guilty about my drinking alone, as we've had our little ritual going for some time now, and so he joined me. It was a nice ending to our day; I checked my emails and wrote a couple of little ones before going to bed at... where did the time go????... 1 A.M.! </p>
<p>I am enjoying the Barbara Kingsolver book so much I managed somehow to stay awake until 1:45 reading.</p>
