								<h2>Jetlagged, Stan Rogers, and Happy Birthday, Beth!</h2>
								<p>At 8:00 A.M. Toronto time, my body decided it was time for me to awaken; I gave up trying to convince it otherwise and got out of bed at 5:30 local time. </p>
<p>There were over 250 emails in my inbox waiting to be answered/ sorted/filed/tossed or answered, so I spent the next two-plus hours working on that project. </p>
<p>Just as I had wrapped myself in a towel after showering, there was a loud knocking on the bathroom door; Riku had come up to say hello on his way to school, while Bryn dropped off the laundry. Akane and Mirei were to be over soon to spend the morning and I had hoped Amelia would be here for a few hours as well; she would have loved the time with the baby. However, Mirei slept for a long time this morning and Amelia and Susan had a slow beginning to their day on Ashbury Street. Riku and Bryn had popped in for a visit while Amelia was still in her PJs, so there were no children here this morning after all.</p>
<p>I called Beth hoping to talk to her on birthday number 55, but there was no answer. I sang "Happy Birthday" to her on the phone, and just prayed that no one would hear it but her. She wrote later saying she had had a wonderful day, despite having to work, with lots of flowers and presents given to her while she was there. Her birthday will be celebrated properly on Sunday. </p>
<p>I put the last load of their clothes in the washer at 11 A.M., so that I could get working on our big basket waiting upstairs, emptied out one big suitcase, and sorted through my mail.</p>
<p>We arrived at the school at 1:05 to pick Riku up from school. He's a big guy there now, so his name is on the "senior" sheet and his cubby near the front of the building. It was lovely to see that happy little boy come running towards me! I read him three new Caillou stories on the way home, and he wanted a little time playing with two new plastic animals before napping. I fell asleep with him for forty minutes(!) ... a rare thing for me, and he napped from 1:50 to 4 P.M. </p>
<p>When he first awoke we sat on his bed, tossing a stuffed animal back and forth between us. Every so often I would pretend that it was knocking me backwards, and he laughed out loud so hard each time I did it. How easily one can make a child laugh! </p>
<p>The sparkly white PlayDoh from the Dollar Store in the Falls was a huge hit, and Riku rolled happily away with the small rolling pin, ending up with three tiny little "ice cream" confections for me, artfully decorated. He gave me a knife and fork but no spoon, telling me it was "too sticky" to eat with my fingers. </p>
<p>The highlight of the day was Riku asking me if I knew the song about "straight dark rows"! I was astounded that he knew this Stan Rogers song, "The Field Behind the Plow"; Doug told me that Bryn plays it on the car stereo while they drive to and from school. He has heard him sing it before but was obviously still amazed at how well he knows it. Doug played it on the computer for us, and Riku sat playing with the PlayDo while singing along to it. To hear that little boy singing "Take the wife back home for Christmas if you can; All summer she hangs on, while you're so tied to the land" was the sweetest thing I have heard for a long time! He was singing quietly along to himself as it played, and with such feeling too. Wow! </p>
<p>We were just heading out the door for some sidewalk chalk time when Bryn arrived, so he chatted with his dad, while we drew Riku's body outline on the sidewalk and then crossed the street to say hello to our old "pal", a lovely older man and his tiny dog. </p>
<p>We were busy playing hide and seek when Riku spotted a little girl climbing into a car, just a few houses down. He ran over to say "hi" to her and her parents and we learned that they will be our neighbours for only two months before moving to the other side of the city; however, they invited us to knock on their door anytime Riku wanted to play, and I know Amelia would enjoy meeting her too. She's four years old and has two dogs, which will be a huge hit with Amelia as well. </p>
<p>I waved goodbye to Riku and Bryn at 6 P.M., came in and took care of a few more emails, and finally headed upstairs to eat our very light dinner of potstickers while watching a movie with Doug. He rubbed my shoulders as I lay across his legs, and I dozed off now and then while watching a sweet old movie (from the 40s), set in the Hebrides during WW2. The day ended with a hot cup of tea, while sitting on the sofa and dozing off. Bedtime at 11:40.</p>
