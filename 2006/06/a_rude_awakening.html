								<h2>A Rude Awakening</h2>
								<p>Well, this will teach us to not go to bed so late; the eavestroughing workers were here at 8 A.M., pounding away outside our bedrooms. I got up immediately; UF woke up at 8:30 and Candy, who had trouble falling asleep last night, slept in until 9:30. We all thought we would be exhausted tonight, but we still managed to stay up later than was wise. </p>
<p>The morning flew by with the usual routine; breakfast together, rather late, and then an early lunch, as Candy and I went off to a funeral service for the mother of a friend of Jan's and Glenn's. She was very supportive of Glenn when our parents died, and when Jan died as well. The service started at 1 P.M., and somehow, despite going to the wrong funeral home and dashing downtown to the right one, we made it just in time. We went to the cemetery following the service, and had a little time with Glenn, Wendy, Becky, and Wayne. We took the time to water the newly planted flowers at Mom's and Dad's gravesite, and at Auntie Rita's as well. </p>
<p>Oh, just as I had prepared our lunch, the phone rang. It was a very old acquaintance, Judy Armstrong, from my "Honeymoon Gift Shop" days, when we were both seventeen years old. She and Gail reconnected a few years ago, after the death of the woman who had been our boss; they had both been in touch with Mrs. Hartley for years at Christmas, and her kind daughter passed on Gail's name and address to Judy after her mom died. We have been in touch via email as well now for about two years, and what fun it was to hear her voice this morning!  </p>
<p>After the ceremony at the cemetery, we went home to Uncle Frank, and almost immediately went out to St. David's to buy four more rose bushes, all beautifully scented and quite a good size, white impatiens, and alyssum.  </p>
<p>We had heard that "Lococo's", in "Silver Town", had a great price on asparagus, and other veggies, and since none of us has ever been there (they are celebrating their 100th anniversary this year too!), we drove there and bought lots of goodies: corn, tomatoes, asparagus, avocado, and mushrooms. Home to unload it all and then sat and had hot cups of tea and two cookies each. Yum! We were ready for it. </p>
<p>Time to drop at By's and Jo's for dinner at 6 P.M., while Candy and I met Sheldon and Donna at "Chatter's" for a most delicious dinner (pizza for the girls!), and lots of laughs. We picked UF up at 8 P.M., drove to Jepson Street, and had such a good evening at their house. What a good time we have with them always! I had a small glass of Bristol Cream (I think!), we had tea, and planned to get together on Sunday for a girl's night at their lovely home. </p>
<p>Came home and worked on our crossword  puzzle until too late again... 1:20! ... and I still read before turning out the light.</p>
