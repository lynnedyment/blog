								<h2>"Team Dedo" and a Happy Father's Day</h2>
								<p>I had a lovely snuggly sleep with Caillie, and to my surprise woke at 7:10. I wanted to get in the shower before anyone else and be ready to go on time. It's hard to get this many people out the door in such a short time! I had time, though, to quickly check my email, before making oatmeal for Myk' and me, and she and I peeled and cut up fresh cucumber, carrots, and celery for the backpack. I popped in a few slices of sourdough bread, some of the three loaves I had brought from SF for them all. Thank goodness I hadn't left them in Niagara Falls, as they were all keen to have it. Kelly had a yogurt and her toast in the car, as we dashed out the door at 8:45. </p>
<p>Back in SF, Doug had spent the greater part of the day with Bryn, Akane, Riku, and Mirei, with breakfast out, and lots of time at Tilden Park in Berkeley, riding the train our Toronto children love so much, and exploring a nearby lake. </p>
<p>The main event today was a 5K walk for prostate cancer, starting near Ontario Place. It began at 9:30, and we were there in time for fresh pastries, delicious and tiny bran muffins, and bottled water, before beginning our walk. It was hot already and the little patches of shade were more than welcome. Caillie was having a hard time with it at first, as bedtime was too late for her last night, and she dragged along, being reminded once or twice about how much easier this was than the Grand Canyon walk! We finished in exactly one hour, collected our free t-shirts, and posed for a very friendly fellow taking free digital photos for the event. He also took a couple with my camera so I shall have a copy too. </p>
<p>Kelly and Gregg had collected $420 in donations, a very good total, considering they had only heard about the walk last week. Next year they hope to have t-shirts with "Team Dedo" on them, in tribute to Gregg's dad, the children's "Dedo", who has had prostate cancer and is a survivor. We saw so many people walking in honour of their dads, brothers, and grandfathers, and were surprised to learn that 1 in 7 Canadian men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetimes, and of those seven, one in four will die of it. </p>
<p>Along with our free admission to Ontario Place for the day, came a free healthy lunch as part of the walk. We collected our brown-bagged lunches, and sat on tiered seating, enjoying whole wheat bagels, along with single servings of peanut butter, jam, or cream cheese, a piece of fruit (banana, apple, or orange), a small oatmeal bar, bottled water, various flavoured yogurts, and bagged tiny carrots with dip. </p>
<p>And then it was off for the fun! What a wonderful day I had with them all; the children went through some buildings on their own, and then we all went down the log ride. I always forget how much I really do <strong>not</strong> like that long upward climb on the ride, knowing full well it is going to be a much steeper downward slide down than I like! I screamed, much to the delight of the children, and especially Myk' who chose to go down with her hands in the air. I meanwhile had white knuckles and was happy to get off, wet and relieved to be alive. Bryn talked me into this ride last year too! One day I will remember I don't like it a bit... </p>
<p>The afternoon flew by... we all had ice cream but Bryn, who preferred a "beavertail" covered in cinnamon sugar. The children and parents spent lots of time in the various water venues, while I lay on my back on the grass, watching the clouds float by, enjoying the undersides of the green leaves on the tree over me, and hoping that none of the gulls would drop any offerings on me as I lay there. </p>
<p>Kelly came by to talk me into going on the "pink" water ride with the girls. She offered me her suit but I decided I didn't mind if my clothes got wet; she assured me I wouldn't get any wetter than I did on the canoe ride. Hah! Turns out there are <strong>holes</strong> in the bottom of the rafts and you <strong>sit</strong> in about four inches of water at the beginning of the ride. I was nervous about the ride as we had to climb a long way up to get to the top of it, but both girls assured me it was not scary and it wasn't... it was just such fun and I enjoyed the gentle bumps and twirls the raft made on the way down to the bottom of it. Next time I will take my suit along though; I was soaked and ended up taking my cotton pants off, hanging them on the fence where Kelly and Gregg were sitting to wait for the children, and throwing on a towel around my waist. This worked just fine as the sun was hot and the slacks were dry in less than an hour. </p>
<p>Bryn and I went off on our own to play mini-golf, and he won by a stroke. Darn! The others were getting into dry clothes and we left around 5 P.M., hoping to get a roti at a spot on our way to the bus terminal. No such luck on Sunday, but I had time to buy a fully loaded grilled veggie "dog" from a street vendor outside the bus terminal and sat inside eating it before getting the bus at 6:15 for the Falls. </p>
<p>Kelly had called Glenn, after getting no answer at UF's, and he and Wendy were there to pick me up just after 8 P.M. UF, Neal, and By' were all home, but the new phone hadn't been hooked up, and so there was no message waiting to pick me up. By' and Jo' had bought UF a great new highbacked chair for his computer, and it is perfect. Just last week UF and I had been talking about looking at a new one for him. </p>
<p>Neal and I sat downstairs watching a show on the Queen's official 80th birthday party, and saw lots of footage of her over the years. After By' left, UF joined us for a while. I made our tea, Neal went off to bed about 10 o'clock, and UF and I had port in the living room. I turned out my light at 12:15.</p>
