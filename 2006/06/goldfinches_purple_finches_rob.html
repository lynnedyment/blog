								<h2>Goldfinches, Purple Finches, Robins, and Mourning Doves</h2>
								<p>One of Auntie Rita's greatest pleasures was awakening to the sounds of the birds outside her bedroom window in the summer. I am sleeping in that bedroom and know exactly just how sweet it is. Uncle Frank has the bird feeders full, and I awaken to their songs, and get to watch them while preparing the meals here. I slept in until 9:15 this morning, and then spent the next two hours on the computer while UF slept in. I finally managed to get through some emails, write up two blogs, and answer some emails as well. I was doing so well keeping up with them the first few days of my trip, but now have well over 200 stacked up, with less than a third of them answered. </p>
<p>We ate a cold breakfast today, but started with a big fruit plate again. Uncle Frank is enjoying this thoroughly, as the strawberries are sweet, the grapes crisp and juicy, and the half banana a regular part of our breakfast these days. He tried on a couple of pairs of pants from his closet after showering and is delighted to fit into pants he hasn't worn in years, all size 36. He's determined not to gain any weight; tomorrow we hope to clear out some of the larger and older pants. </p>
<p>I went out to plant two rose bushes before the day got hotter; they look so beautiful and when UF saw them he commented that he was sure there was room for one more! He's addicted to these new roses and wants as many of them as he can get. Already he's talking about digging a new flower bed in front of the patio for next summer, just so he can fill it with roses. </p>
<p>I continued cleaning the back area, digging up around the bed so the water doesn't run off after watering, sweeping very thoroughly, pulling up each tiny weed growing between the red bricks, moving the table and chairs onto the lawn to clear under them, etc. UF joined me at one point and continued sweeping and weeding, working together until it was finished. We moved out a wooden bench that has been in storage for years, and placed two lounge chairs on the lawn, ready for stretching out on a warm day. Today was hot, and I was glad to come in and freshen up for some errands in the car. It was too late for our intended drive to Wainfleet to see the antique cars, so we will be going tomorrow instead. </p>
<p>We went off to look at a storm door at Home Depot; after finding doors priced at $700 at two independent door makers UF was happy to find one at almost half that price. We had a very friendly man named Joe helping UF with all his questions, and it was a delight to deal with him. They will come out to measure and UF will have a brand new door in three weeks. He was very pleased as he wanted a good solid doorframe, but with full glass, and this fit the bill perfectly at a good price. </p>
<p>It was well past time for lunch, so we stopped at Boston Pizza, next door to Home Depot, and shared a medium pizza with green olives and mushrooms. UF had a half pint of light beer too, and we relaxed and enjoyed our late lunch. Next stop was dropping off cross-country skis and shoes at Goodwill, picking up some dry cleaning, and a last stop for four more bags of red stone. This should be the last of that, as the flower and perennial beds are almost fully covered. We filled in an area between the neighbour's yard and the garage with red stone when Candy was here, and it took a lot of stones to cover this area, which has scrappy grass and too much shade. Placing the last of the stones will be tomorrow's yard chore. </p>
<p>By' was here when we arrived at 5:20; after waiting five minutes for us, he decided to wash his car. This gave UF ten minutes to sit on a chair and watch him, and to take my photo near the car. He even had By' take one too; I felt very awkward posing by the car, but it was a photo he wanted. </p>
<p>We had several things put aside to give to Byron, and the last of them made him very happy. I turned over the four full boxes of photos of him and his family, taken over all the years. Many had been sorted into "events" by Auntie Rita, but there were also thousands of loose photos which were finally separated into these boxes for By' and Jo'. the best of the lot, though, was a fifth flat box, filled with the best treasures: black and white photos of By' as a baby and young child, going on through the years until his early teens. By then, photos were in colour, and they were in the other boxes. However, there were also wonderful old birthday cards to and from Byron, from birth photos to cards he signed (or had signed for him) for Mother's and Father's Days from the time he was a just a little guy. Mother's Day cards he had made, primary report cards, and letters to and from his grandparents in Colorado. What a lucky pair of boys Neal and By' were, to have a mother who saved all these for them. By' was very surprised and said he had no idea his mom had saved any of these things. </p>
<p>They went off for their fish and chip special at the Queen's, and I spent almost four hours with Marie. They have the sweetest little house, and tonight I took some photos of some of my favourite areas inside, collections of old graters, a set of tea cups in a stand in their bedroom, and a collection of birdhouses arranged in the computer room. I showed Marie some of the photos in my albums, and of course we exchanged stories about all the cute things our grandchildren have been saying over the past few months. We had tea, and we even had time for one game of Aces before I left at 10 o'clock. </p>
<p>UF was busy clearing things out of the garage when I got home! I had been cleaning the garage over the past few days, sweeping and tidying, and hoping to have time for some more clearing out. It was so hot yesterday that we decided it was a job that could wait until the fall, but the skis went out at least. However, after his evening out at the Massard Jr's, he had found a few things to take to Goodwill, had By' take the lawn mower from the laundry room, and got lots done. I convinced him it was time to stop for our crossword puzzle and a dish of strawberries. He was happy to do so; we completed the puzzle very quickly tonight, and sat with the last of this bottle of port for an extra fifteen minutes before heading to bed at just past midnight.</p>
