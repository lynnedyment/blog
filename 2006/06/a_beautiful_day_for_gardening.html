								<h2>A Beautiful Day for Gardening, and a Family Gathering...</h2>
								<p>Uncle Frank was up, showered, dressed, looking perky and fresh, and sitting at the computer when I wandered out of my room at 9:30. He said he was awake at Denver time, which was 8 A.M. Amazing, but he hadn't slept enough... </p>
<p>Candy got up right away too, and UF waited until after 10 for breakfast. Of course he said he was starving, and I suggested that he could have eaten some cereal on his own; his answer was that he enjoys being waited on and was not going to miss out on even one opportunity to be so. </p>
<p>The plan last night was for Candy and me to be outside planting five rose bushes while Uncle Frank slept in, but plans were foiled by our laziness. We had a quick breakfast of cereal, fresh mango, bananas, and toast, and then sat chatting away for another hour or more! It's hard to get started at all our jobs, but once we do, we keep at it. Having this time together to just relax and chat is every bit as important as finishing up the job list. </p>
<p>I cleared up the kitchen, and Candy installed a new hand-held shower in the main bathroom. She said it should have taken ten minutes (she's an old hand at these jobs), but had trouble with the connection not leaking. Soon all three of us were in the bathroom, offering help wherever we could. UF finally managed to tighten the top connection, and we were ready for some outside work.</p>
<p>It was quite cool this morning, and we all had jackets on. Of course, once we started digging holes in the rocky soil for the roses we warmed up soon enough. It was a big job, as Candy especially had lots of red rocks used for ground cover over the years, that had sunk down into the soil at the left, door side of the area. I was luckier with the centre of the bed, but when we finished it off it looked just gorgeous. UF kept busy filling containers with water and plant food, and of course figuring out just where the roses should go, and telling us exactly how far down to plant, etc. Candy said she is learning lots! </p>
<p>From there we went back to filling up the shady area by the garage with more of the red rocks UF had dashed out to buy on his own yesterday, his first solo car trip since before leaving for Denver in April. </p>
<p>And then around 1:15 P.M. Candy left us. Beth is claiming her again, as she is off work for three days. She was at a funeral this morning and early afternoon, so we had Candy with us longer than we thought we would. We were not happy letting her go, but Beth will be happy to have her back with her, and won't be working her nearly as hard as we did here. However, Candy will be back with us on Monday night and painting is on the schedule for her then! </p>
<p>Uncle Frank and I had big lunches today, our leftovers from dinner last night. I cooked up some fresh asparagus to go with it, and UF had me try honey with cucumbers, something he learned from a Serbian co-worker many years ago. It was delicious! Try it! </p>
<p>After lunch, Uncle Frank looked more tired than I have seen him in a long time. His poor muscles have really been working hard these past few days, with all the bending, dragging, lifting, and walking too, back and forth through stores and the yard. He took two muscle relaxing tablets, curled up in his bed, covers pulled up to chin, and fell into a deep sleep for fifty minutes. </p>
<p>I called the children at Kelly's, leaving a message for Myk' and Bryn about their concert today in Orilia, and catching up on emails and my blog. </p>
<p>I had to waken Uncle Frank at 4 P.M. and hated to do so, but he had asked me to do this. We were to have been at Beth's and Paul's an hour ago, and it was time to make our way to McKenney Road. He could sit in the sun over in their lovely yard and be waited on. We left the house at 4:45, taking a new route. This took us only seventeen minutes, and we were behind a very slow and very big tractor, adding possibly three minutes to the trip. Despite the new road being faster, we decided we really did enjoy the slower drive along Hokum Road, so we could feel we were in the country for a longer time. The newer road takes us just two minutes away from their house. </p>
<p>Gerry and Lionel were already there, and we all sat outside in the sunshine-y breezy day, watching the finches and robins, and were lucky enough to spot a hummingbird at the feeder. Beth had made up some appetizers, and we had taken a shrimp tray out, so we sat in the sun with our drinks, nibbling away at the delicious treats... ham rolls, the way Ian taught her to make them, two types of cheese, mixed pickles, and the shrimp. </p>
<p>Rina, their dog, is so happy living out here. She is red and white and is just gorgeous; it's such a sight to see her running around this huge property and getting all the exercise she needs. I think she might be happier than anyone else with this new house! I had lots of fun throwing little bits of bone or coconut shell to her, which she would dash off and look for, with great intensity, until bringing it, sogging and yucky, back to me again. </p>
<p>For our dinner, Paul was busy barbecuing chicken breasts, Beth cooked up a big pile of corn-on-the-cob, and Candy had made the most delicious asparagus lasagna after getting there this afternoon. I have the recipe and will be making it at home. We sat at a table under the gazebo for dinner, until it got a little chilly when the breeze picked up. </p>
<p>We went into the house for tea and Gerry's date squares for dessert, warmed up and served with vanilla ice cream. They were a big hit this way and Beth and Lionel had suggested it. Shel' and Donna came by not much later, and we spread out into the dining room, living room, while Shel' and Lionel watched most of a hockey game in Beth and Paul's bedroom, just off the dining room. </p>
<p>We "girls" wanted a group photo of us taken, so we talked the reluctant trio into taking lots of photos of us, using all available cameras. It was quite the photo shoot, and the guys now feel that photographers aren't paid enough. We laughed and hooted our way through dozens of poses. Donna, Candy, Gerry and I sat on one big sofa, while Beth lay across our laps, doing her Marilyn imitation at times, which the boys thought was too funny, until we had them do the posing. UF, Sheldon, and Paul sat on the sofa while Lionel stretched out across their laps. What a riot this was! We have some fabulous shots. </p>
<p>We finished this off, to the groans of the men, by setting up two of the cameras with timers for a group shot of all of us. I think I was up and down about sixteen times, pushing the buttons and dashing madly back to sit on the floor with the "girls" and look composed... sort of. Oh, did I mention that we had all tried a new liquor? Oh my, was it good; I will be buying a bottle of Amarula Marula Fruit Cream to take home, or seeking it out in SF! </p>
<p>We had such a wonderful time and, as always, lots of laughs. We missed Ian and Lisa who were too tired after a busy day to come out (they're having a garage sale tomorrow), and Glenn and Wendy, who are at their trailer this weekend. </p>
<p>We were the first to leave, at 10:30; Lionel and Sheldon had to watch the last two minutes of the game... which takes longer than two minutes of course. Candy and I had pulled the little tabs on the solar lights this afternoon, so UF and I were hoping that we would see them glowing in one of the front gardens when we came home. We did, and they looked very pretty indeed. We strolled around for a few minutes admiring the results of our hard work. </p>
<p>A crossword puzzle finished off our evening perfectly; it took a little longer than an hour. Uncle Frank had his "Sleepytime" tea, and I showed him a few photos of Amelia on Susan's blogs, read Kelly's email about Myk's and Bryn's very successful and happy week away at music camp, and went off to bed. I turned my light off at 1:15. We have no idea how it gets so late so fast around here! UF was still up too...</p>
