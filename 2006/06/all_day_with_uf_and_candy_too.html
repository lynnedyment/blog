								<h2>All Day with UF, and Candy Too!</h2>
								<p>I awoke at 8:30 A.M. after waking earlier from a most disturbing dream; I didn't feel I could shake it off by getting up, so went back to sleep for an hour, waking in a much happier state. UF was awake soon after, and we had a bit of a rushed morning. Cold cereal for breakfast, and no time for a leisurely sit at the table reading the paper. </p>
<p>We had promised to pick Candy up at 10:30, and it was an hour later when we finally got out there. The dinner menu tonight is "Steak Diane", done in the slow cooker, so we had taken the extra time to get this going before leaving. UF sliced the mushrooms, I did the onions, and he finished off the rest of it with soup and spices. I also had to take the eight heavy bags of red rocks from the back of the car, and we gathered together the tools for the planting at the cemetery.</p>
<p>We took the highway out to Lion's Creek Road, and then enjoyed the long slower stretch of Yokum Road. Driving out to Beth and Paul's (and Carol's and Mark's) is always a pleasure. Beth had sent photos through of a huge and muddy snapping turtle this morning, found not too far from their house. UF said it was almost a Denver morning, if the sky had been just a little bit bluer. We took a different route back into the city, driving along Montrose Road until we hit Thorold Stone Road, and on to the cemetery.  </p>
<p>While UF fetched the water, Candy and I pulled the weeds and planted the pink impatiens and allysum at AR's stone. Then it was around the corner and down another path to Mom's and Dad's, where we planted pink impatiens between the three healthy green hostas, and put down a thick layer of small white stones. I watered a couple of other plots as well, as the sun was hot and the new plantings drying out. </p>
<p>Home to clean up and have lunch. I made Candy and UF tomato, jalepeno, havarti cheese, and olive sandwiches, and made myself an egg salad sandwich. UF finished off the chicken noodle soup from yesterday, and we relaxed over cups of tea. </p>
<p>Next came the bigger job of planting the front of the house; we planted two dozen begonias under the small tree, with UF edging and digging the holes for us. Next Candy spread some peat moss and fine mulch, and watered each hole, while I placed the pink flowers. The lamp post was next, a bigger job since there was a dead bush Candy pulled out while I weeded and UF edged again. We ran out of pink impatiens for this area so after cleaning up, and Candy planting one of the two planters with geraniums and a spear of tall green, we came in for a cold drink and a snack for UF. </p>
<p>Off we went again for more flowers. Gerry had called telling us that impatiens were on sale near Zeller's and UF found two of the five rose bushes he wanted for the back there as well. Had a long shopping spree at Canadian Tire for a new hand-held shower head for the bathroom, a new spray faucet head for the kitchen sink, a box of six solar lamps for the front pathway, and plastic containers for some of the dry products we have bought recently. UF also bought sealant for a leaking basement wall area. </p>
<p>Dinner was quickly ready after cooking some egg noodles, beans for UF, and slicing up tomatoes for caprese salad for all of us. I had two small canneloni for dinner. UF was so pleased with the slow cooker meal; both he and Candy said it was delicious, even though in our rush we forgot to halve the amount of onion and dry mustard! </p>
<p>We sat over the daily crossword while having our tea, a tough one with two or three words we thought we wouldn't get at all. However, while Candy and I were busy with other things, UF managed to figure out the long word giving us trouble. </p>
<p>The rest of the evening passed quickly... Candy and I put out the garbage and recycling and played a game of cards, while UF did some sorting in his office and a little emailing. Then he and Candy sat and visited in the living room, while I answered a couple of emails and wrote up my blog. I had my port upstairs while UF had his in the living room with Candy. </p>
<p>Other news: Gail was in the hospital last night for a few hours with a terrible pain in her chest and back; she had 13 nurses trying to get an I.V. in for Gravol and two nurses tried for a blood test after that. She arrived at eleven A.M. and left at 4 P.M. in the daytime, not the night. They finally eased the pain and she went home with a diagnosis of what they felt might have been a large gas bubble. </p>
<p>Amelia has written me another email; she and Riku had another fun hour together this morning before Riku headed off to school. She and her mom were also over at Rhode Island Street gardening (lucky me!), with Amelia busy playing in the yard, and on the big train upstairs. Doug flew to New Jersey last night for his annual PEA meeting. He's away until Sunday night.</p>
<p>Bed too late... 12:30, with the light out in our room at 1:15 A.M.</p>
