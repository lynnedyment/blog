								<h2>Busy, Busy Day</h2>
								<p>Hot muggy day here today; I could feel the heat and the humidity the moment I woke up this morning, so got right to work. No point in showering since I knew within minutes of doing anything physical I would need another one. I changed the bedding on both beds as soon as UF was out of the shower, we sat and had a leisurly breakfast of cold cereal, etc. while reading the paper, and then the day got really busy. I tidied the laundry room with UF's help, cleaned the bathrooms, did all the ironing and continued on with it as the laundry got finished; we went through UF's closet, checking out shirt sizes, as well as a few pairs of trousers. I planted the newest rose, a beautiful pale pink called "Princess Grace", spread out another three bags of red rocks around the back and sides of the house, made a fruit salad, cooked broccoli for UF to have cold tomorrow, chatted with Marie and Graham for an hour while we had lunch (I had hoped to join them at "The Donut Diner" where they ate), and away went our day with random jobs around the house. </p>
<p>Just before 6 P.M. UF and I dashed out in the car to take a load of shirts, slacks, typewriters, and a decades-old hair dryer to Goodwill. We were so pleased they were still open, and they were delighted with our offerings. </p>
<p>Home for dinner; it was tempting to take UF up on his offer to eat out, but there was food in the fridge I wanted to use up. We were both very hungry after our busy day, so quite enjoyed our whole wheat pasta with "ground round" and fresh tomatoes added to the sauce, a nice big serving each of sauteed spinach with pine nuts, and a half cob of corn each. For dessert we had the freshly picked rhubarb with strawberries added to it we made up last night, and of course Devon custard. What a treat, and we took a little time over tea for a break before starting up again. </p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Bob McLean had stopped in, and was disappointed to learn I was leaving tomorrow. We had hoped to get together with Judy and Bob last week, but somehow the time slipped away. So, the plan was that they would come over this evening for a visit. I expected them to arrive at 9:30.</p>
<p>So at 8 P.M., UF went off to the grocery store on his own. My plan was to vacuum upstairs and downstairs quickly while he was gone, leaving a few minutes to tidy up a bit. However, the doorbell rang at 8:15, and we had company... so, we had a visit in the kitchen, while I chatted and peeled some veggies for a slow cooker side dish for UF tomorrow. </p>
<p>UF went off to Canadian Tire too, so didn't arrive home until 9:15; Judy and Bob stayed on an extra hour, and by that time I was really tired, with no energy at all. We did have our glass of port and strawberries, and did a few crossword lines, but went off to bed before midnight. </p>
<p>Glenn was to have seen a doctor today at 4:30, but no word from him as to how it had all gone; he was still in a lot of pain when I talked with him earlier.</p>
