								<h2>Crosswords and A Day Out</h2>
								<p>I awoke at 9:15 this morning, surprised to have slept so late. Got busy going through old emails and wrote up my blog; it was hot already and there is gardening to be done. </p>
<p>UF emerged at 10:15, and went back into his room after saying "good morning". I was certain he was in there using his back massager but he tucked back into bed and came out an hour later, not happy that he had slept so long. He has a hard time sleeping as long as his body needs, and I refuse to waken him unless he has an appointment early in the day.</p>
<p>I showered and went outside to plant the two roses from Palantine Nursery. The digging was hot and one spot particularly challenging (there are a lot of roses in that bed!); I really should have showered after doing this, but I must say the new ones look just gorgeous, and are stealing the show. Then I distributed four big bags of red stones over the back garden beds. We had thought this would be the end of it, but we are still short of really covering things properly. UF will have to decide if he wants to buy more and be thorough, or if this will do the trick for this summer. I finished up by sweeping the patio thoroughly, and pulling the last few tiny weeds from between the bricks. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank decided that we wouldn't go to the antique car show after all, as he had overdone the work in the yard and garage yesterday and was feeling too sore for much walking. Fine with me, as it was obviously going to be a hot, hot day today. </p>
<p>Breakfast was light... a big fruit plate each, with some cereal and toast for UF, and strawberry yogurt and toast for me. UF said it all looked so pretty, that I should take a photo of it, so I did. </p>
<p>After freshening up, we headed out for a full day away from the house. First stop was the Goodwill Store, where we unloaded plastic flower pots, a tin pail, a padded garden hanging basket, a wooden goose mobile, and some stakes for tomato plants, all things UF had decided late last night he no longer needed taking up space in the garden. The woman who took them from me was delighted and said she could use them all. </p>
<p>UF had decided that we should top up the red rocks, so three more big bags went into the back of the car, ensuring, UF told me, a smoother ride out to buy a new rose! We stopped for quart baskets of local strawberries and cherries on Mountain Road, before taking the long way out to Virgil to the nursery. What a lovely day for a ride in the country! I took a nice photo of UF choosing his last rose for this summer, with the help of the friendly woman who remembered his last two choices. We put another shade of soft pink rose in the car, and a second basket of smaller strawberries in as well, and continued on our way. </p>
<p>Next stop was a short visit to a very busy Main Street in Niagara-on-the-Lake, to buy some jam at Greaves. They have some unusual jams there as well as the traditional strawberry, raspberry, and peach, and UF is now well stocked. </p>
<p>We both wanted to see Becky's and Wayne's new house, so off we went along the beautiful Niagara Parkway, briefly stopping to have a look at "The Pump House", where Amanda is teaching art classes for the summer. What a beautiful setting to be working in! The Pump House is right behind the fort, and along the road are the most beautiful old homes, with the main street not too far away. </p>
<p>Becky and Wayne live almost directly across the street from the MacFarland House, a spot Doug and I loved to visit when we were dating. We had picnics there and sat in the shade of the old trees beside the main house. I was so busy checking out this area that we drove right by the little white house set well back from the road. Luckily, the best place to turn around happened to be a winery (there seem to be hundreds of them in this area now), and we went in for a wee taste test of an early "dessert" wine. UF also tasted a dry white wine, which he bought. </p>
<p>Access to Becky's and Wayne's is not from the Parkway, but from a small side road just before the house. It is one of several homes set in the midst of a vineyard, and what a spot they have! It is costing them less to rent this reasonably small house, with an amazing setting, than it does to rent an apartment in Niagara Falls. They were both busy working in the huge yard when we drove up, and they stopped to give us a tour. They have already painted three rooms, Wayne has trimmed many of the old neglected trees on the property, they have pulled out big overgrown bushes near the door and front windows, planted peonies and a vegetable garden, and have plans for a new stone walkway, with lots still to do. The older couple who own all of the property are so pleased to have a young couple taking care of it for them, and Becky and Wayne are delighted to be that couple! I took some photos, so eventually they will be up on my Ontario-in-the-summer album.</p>
<p>Across the street from them, on the side road, is the well-known Kurtz Orchards, known for their jams, jellies, and various food treats. They used to sell produce as well, but no longer do that. So, feeling a bit peckish, we took advantage of their many samples and ate our way through the building. We had garlic and cheddar dressing on pretzel sticks, many many jams and jellies, a few curds (the best of which was "mango madness"), and some peanuts and honey too. Yum! The car was sitting even lower when we pulled away!</p>
<p>By this time, Uncle Frank realized that he was really hungry. I suggested just heading home for some of our many leftovers, but he would have none of it. We stopped at a little restaurant in Virgil where he and Auntie Rita often ate, called "Lawrenceville". There wasn't a lot in this "specializing in prime rib" spot for me, so I ordered a Western sandwich, with no ham, and with added tomatoes. It was so big that I ate only the omelette with no bread at all, and cancelled the fries that came with it. UF enjoyed his pastrami-on-rye with a bowl of beef barley soup. </p>
<p>Back to the Falls, hoping to get to Lococo's for some corn on the cob before they closed, but we were an hour late. Perhaps we will find some tomorrow, as we both enjoyed it so much. We stopped at the cemetery and watered both gravesites thoroughly, and then drove to Donna's and Sheldon's to leave a brochure from Candy for them. No one was home, but I stopped long enough to take the photos of their back garden I didn't take the last time I was there. Donna has a long row of beautiful roses along a fence and they smelled just amazing; I know, I smelled each and every one of them. </p>
<p>Next stop... Marie and Graham's, to take some photos of their little "doll house" as UF calls their home. Graham has just finished re-siding the top portion and of course their gardens are always in perfect and glorious condition. I had Graham take a couple of photos of Marie and me too, which will no doubt turn out better than than the two I took using the top of the car as a base. UF and Graham had time to talk about all the various plants and garden techniques Graham uses too; years ago he found six old pillars in terrible shape, and now two of them are part of his rebuilt front porch. </p>
<p>Tea time (actually, long past tea time at 6:30) and since Beth wasn't home (we had hoped to stop in there and spray her roses for her), we called Gerry and had our tea on her wee porch, along with Girl Guide cookies. Gerry is on her own this week while Lionel is away fishing, so I may have some time with her tomorrow to take photos in the cemeteries. Now that I have the digital camera I would like to document all the various burial sites for our family; this way they can be online for everyone else when they want the information. </p>
<p>We left at 9 P.M., when it was still miraculously light out, and went home to check out why our little moon lights weren't working. After spending some time at the front (the ones at the back work fine), UF decided the house lights under the eaves were making the lights think that it was still day time. His solution? He has tucked little stones on top of each one, and says he will "untuck" them each morning. </p>
<p>Then followed our now usual evening routine... sleepytime tea for UF, with bowls of fresh strawberries for both of us. The crossword puzzle awaited us, of course, but it was a tougher than usual one, and we finally decided to leave the final five words until tomorrow, when we could look at it with fresh eyes. No doubt one wrong word has thrown us off. Bed before midnight! </p>
<p>Oh, one last thing... </p>
<p>"Served at the seder was sauteed elver and eared seal, sauteed in a spate of sloe sauce, beautifully presented in an antique osier basket."</p>
<p>Yup! We've been doing crossword puzzles almost daily, and after spending much time on one particularly tough corner two nights ago, UF decided a sentence of those words was in order. UF always checks in his online dictionaries after we have finished a puzzle for all the words we have never heard of (osier and elver), or words we are not sure how to pronounce or know the exact meanings of. </p>
<p>Just for those who may not be up on these words either, "elver" is a baby eel, an "eared seal" is a "type of seal", "spate" is a sudden flood/rush/outpouring of something, and "osier" baskets are made from natural twigs and grasses. UF didn't know the term "seder", although I got it instantly; reading novels by Singer helps me a lot with the Jewish terms. We make a very good crossword team, though, as I know many movie actors from this era and he has the older ones covered; he knows sea terms and I know kitchen terms, etc., etc.</p>
