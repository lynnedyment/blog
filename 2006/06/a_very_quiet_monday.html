								<h2>A Very Quiet Monday</h2>
								<p>I awoke at 8:15 this morning and UF just an hour later; UF weighed 157(!) this morning, just two pounds away from where Dr. Hadley, the local heart specialist, suggested many years ago that he aim for. He said he never quite made it, and was told he would be skinny at that weight, but he looks great. His reward? A glass of OJ, mango and grapes, two scrambled eggs, two slices of turkey bacon, stewed tomatoes, two slices of toast with jam, and his green tea. </p>
<p>I called Riku at 7:35, catching him just out of bed. He still sounded sleepy, and I called back just before he was leaving for school. We had only a few minutes to talk, so I promised to call back tonight. </p>
<p>Not long after UF ate, he went back to bed. He thinks his shower was too hot this morning and he felt light-headed. He was up an hour or so later, feeling just fine, and made some phone calls and checked his emails. </p>
<p>It was a quiet day at home, despite our intention to get out and run errands early. I kept busy by doing some laundry, cleaning out the fridge, puttering about and reading. We had a late light lunch, and sat at the table trying out the crossword puzzle from the Toronto Star; it's much harder than the Niagara Falls Review puzzle, and we kept at it for an hour or more. </p>
<p>Off to run those errands at 5:30. We had groceries to pick up for Nea's visit here on Thursday, and spent lots of time in Canadian Tire buying hose parts, painting supplies, and a few household items, and then drove to Mullen's Garden Centre for more red rocks for the garden. They didn't have the small ones, so it was Rainbow Gardens next, passing by the house on Ash Street, just for old times sake. It's still not sold. </p>
<p>Dinner was the latest ever; we were both very hungry, but I had a big dinner of wild salmon, sauteed swiss chard, half a sweet potato each, and an ear of corn. UF had his last date square from Gerry for dessert. </p>
<p>I cleaned up, called Riku back and learned he had a new monster, bought in Japantown, and I sang a little bit of a song for him. He asked me if I was coming back soon, and when I heard his voice it seemed not soon enough... still two weeks and two days to go. I know it will go by quickly as it hardly seems possible I have been here for two weeks already! </p>
<p>Bryn said he and Akane both think that Mirei is looking not quite so big these days. However, as he was telling me this, he said she had looked up at him and gave him a look as though wondering how he could look at her and say such a thing! We talked a bit about the possility of Doug and I taking Riku to Vancouver with us next month. If Doug isn't working we will do this. </p>
<p>I called Amelia too, catching her in the tub the first time, and interrupting a new movie the second time. She was gracious enough to talk with me for a bit though, and told me she had taken her "monkey baby" for a ride in the train at our house, and played in the garden. I will be happy to be back and seeing them all again. </p>
<p>I curled up with a book in the living room reading for an hour while UF was on the computer; he came down for his night time cup of tea at 11 P.M. and we finished off the Review crossword. I was in bed with the lights out at midnight.</p>
