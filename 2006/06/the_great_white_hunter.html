								<h2>The Great White Hunter</h2>
								<p>I awoke at 9 A.M. today, a much more reasonable hour(!) and Uncle Frank awakened an hour later. I wrote up my blog, answered many emails, and had time to talk to Candy on the phone before having breakfast with UF. He announced that he was down to 159 pounds today!, and so deserved a non-"Denver breakfast". He requested two fried eggs, one piece of toast, and two slices of bacon; I cooked up a little sauteed tomato for him too. I have not lost three pounds since arriving home, and so had porridge instead. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank was once again busy on the phone making appointments with his two doctors here, and more calls for service work to be done around the house. He is getting so much accomplished and feeling so good about it. </p>
<p>The plumber was here at 12:30, followed shortly thereafter by a fellow about the eavestroughing job. We had a late-ish lunch... soup and a half sandwich for UF and an egg salad sandwich for me. </p>
<p>In no time it seemed that Paul was dropping Candy off, around 3:30. We headed out almost immediately to Rainbow Gardens for pink impatiens, pink begonias, and geraniums for the front gardens and two planters. We took our time wandering about choosing the best of the lot, and Candy, Gail, and I chipped in to buy Beth and Paul a rhododendron as a "new home" gift. We also loaded eight bags of red rock for UF's side pathway, dashed home to clean up and unpack everything, and left immediately to pick up fish and chips for dinner outside on the deck at Gerry and Lionel's. They had been invited here, but the idea of eating at someone else's house was very appealing. It was hot, they have a shady gazebo up, and big fan too! </p>
<p>The fish and chips were delicious, and we took over a big bowl of rhubarb and custard to share for dessert. We had so much fun and laughed so much. Lionel and UF posed in their matching Tilly hats, being ever so silly. We all admired their new computer and huge screen, oohed over photos of two year old Tanner, and then cracked up watching Lionel, complete with a big butterfly net, trying hard to capture a wayward moth in the kitchen! I took lots of photos so have proof of all of the above. We also worked a crossword puzzle, with all five of us contributing. What a grand evening we had; we left about 10:30, came home, and sat chatting in the kitchen finishing up the crossword puzzle UF and I had started at lunch. </p>
<p>At 11 P.M. I drove Candy to the bingo hall to meet up with Beth after work. She was just cashing out so we all had some time together until she finished that up. Home to UF, made him some Sleepytime tea (no port for either of us tonight!), and went to bed at 12:30 A.M. to read.</p>
