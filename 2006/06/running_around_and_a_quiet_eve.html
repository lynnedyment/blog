								<h2>Running Around and a Quiet Evening Out</h2>
								<p>We were all up at a fairly decent hour this morning; I had decided to send Neal and UF off to breakfast without me, as I miss our fresh fruit and lighter breakfasts. I offered to make breakfast here, and was very surprised when Neal agreed, as he is very fond of the time out in a restaurant and the friendly waitresses at the "Queen's Coach". So, we all started off with banana halves and fresh mango, Neal had his eggs with ketchup, UF his usual cereal, juice, toast, and green tea, and I had cereal and juice as well. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank got busy once more trying to get the new phones working, and then settled into his office for emails and phone calls. I did a few small loads of laundry and stayed downstairs ironing until it was all done; UF had some winter shirts hung up from before his trip, and I was behind in my own few blouses, so that was a good job done in the cool of the morning. </p>
<p>UF and I dashed off to Niagara Square after that to get the phone looked at; the gal who helped us at the Bell store, Kerry, was just wonderful and very attentive to UF and his questions about the phone. Of course it worked the minute she plugged them in, but there was something to do with crossing the phones onto the opposite stands after charging that did the trick. UF liked her so much that he almost made her an "honourary niece" after their half hour dialogue about the phone. She was great and so friendly, and UF said on the way home that he almost hoped the phone wouldn't work so he could go back and have her be friendly all over again. We haven't had much luck with helpful or more than just doing-their-job clerks lately. </p>
<p>We stopped at the A&P on the way home to stock up on a half dozen yogurts for Neal, knowing he must be hungry waiting for us. We needn't have worried as he had gone to the back of the fridge and found the tiny and most delicious yogurts Candy had left, completely ignoring all the various flavoured puddings that UF had bought him before his visit. </p>
<p>He had three more yogurts while UF had soup and a whole sandwich (put japepeno havarti cheese on anything and UF thinks I am a gourmet chef!), and I had a sandwich and tea as well. </p>
<p>Neal declined a trip to Costco with us, happily returning to sitting in the vibrating chair downstairs watching TV. We needed just a few more supplies for the house, and I bought Glenn some pistachio nuts after seeing how disappointed he looked when I gave Ian his a few days ago. We had a little time at home before going our separate ways for dinner... UF and Neal to By' and Jo's, and me out with Amelia (as Amy prefers being called now... our Amelia inspired her to use her given name). She pulled up just as UF and Neal were leaving, so they had a chance to say hello; UF and Amelia have met but not Neal and Amelia.</p>
<p>Amelia had heard of a good Chinese restaurant in Chippawa, so off we went. We were the only two people there at 6:30, which was surprising as the food was very good. They have no tofu on the menu, but we shared a shrimp chow mein, and a really delicious thin and tasty noodle dish with lots of mixed and fresh vegetables... no canned mushrooms here! We sat eating slowly, devouring every last bite, even though the plan had been to take half of it home for lunch tomorrow! We had lots of catching up to do, though, and the time flew by for us. A half hour before we left, another group came in, four young women, and sat in the booth behind us. They turned out to be a family Amelia knew, as her eldest daughter and one of the gals had been best friends through high school. I took advantage of this and after they had been talking and catching up, had one of them take a couple of photos of us just before we left. </p>
<p>Home at 9 o'clock. We were sitting in the living room for about fifteen minutes before Neal and UF returned. UF sat with us and visited for a bit while Nea' changed into his PJs and sat in his favourite chair in front of the TV. Amelia left soon after that and I joined Neal downstairs. UF joined us for his tea, then UF and I went up to the kitchen and worked half a crossword puzzle over our port. We stopped long enough to just chat before heading up to bed. I tried to look at Candy's photos, but the computer bogged down on me, and kept freezing so I finally had to give up and get to bed. Hope it's all working in the morning, as UF had had trouble earlier too. Oh, Jo' had made ribs for dinner from a recipe book that UF had brought them back from Denver. He confessed to eating more than the Denver Diet really allows.</p>
