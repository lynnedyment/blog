								<h2>A Quiet Saturday and an Evening Drive</h2>
								<p>I woke at 9 A.M. to find Uncle Frank already up and showered! I showered quickly so we could have an earlier than usual breakfast; today it was cereal, fruit, juice, tea, and whole wheat Italian toast, which we both like a lot. We sat chatting at the table until 11 o'clock; it was overcast and I suggested a short slow walk around the block. However, Uncle Frank felt suddenly tired and went upstairs "just to put my head down" and fell into a deep two-plus-hour sleep.</p>
<p>I tidied up the kitchen, took rhubarb out for dessert later on, and then got busy up here on the computer. I've been making notes for my blogs and was able to catch up with them completely which was great. If I get too far behind I just never seem to catch up.</p>
<p>I called the girls and Candy said they were on their way out to Walmart. Uncle Frank woke at that point and said he wasn't hungry, would get himself something hot to drink, and rest a little longer. I suggested that it might be fun to show up at Walmart and surprise Candy and Beth. So, off I went. I walked around and around for almost an hour, called Carol, who called Beth on her cell phone; she said they were on their way and almost there so I hid out of sight close to the door, hoping to surprise them. The pool toy area got boring pretty darned quickly as I waited and waited and waited. I called again and Carol couldn't get hold of either Beth or Paul on their cells, so after having them paged once more, I gave up and headed home.</p>
<p>Uncle Frank was on the computer and told me he had been very naughty. He had a big grin on his face though and I smiled as he told me he had cooked himself <strong>two</strong> fried eggs (after insisting yesterday that one scrambled was enough), <strong>two</strong> pieces of turkey bacon (one was all he would have yesterday), one slice of our delicious bread, and half an orange instead of orange juice. I was delighted that he ate exactly what he felt like; as much as he wants to keep his weight down he is no doubt missing eating just a little more food too.</p>
<p>I hadn't had lunch and it was almost 4 P.M., so I cooked a bowl of oatmeal and enjoyed it with a piece of toast as well. Uncle Frank was busy on the computer when I walked in, so when I made my tea, I curled up in the living room with it and my book. It was so dark and dreary with the rain that I turned on the lights and settled in for a good two hours.</p>
<p>Dinner at home, about 7:30. We had a "smothered" veggie burger on a slice of toast, topped with a combination of sauteed mushrooms, Vidalia onions, and red pepper. On the side we had cucumber spears and carrot sticks, with rhubarb and custard for dessert. We have decided we should eat this every day so that we are through last year's crop before adding more to the freezer from the now-ready-to-be-picked rhubarb at the side of the house.</p>
<p>Just as we were drinking our tea/hot water (for me), Candy called inviting us out to Beth's. Mark's parents had been visiting today, had just left, and there was some cake for dessert. By the time we got there at 8:45 it was dark and rainy, but the ride out to the house, on the long and deserted lanes, was really lovely, with lots of woods along the way.</p>
<p>Everyone was home... Beth, Paul, Candy, Carol, Mark, and Michael. Beth was coloring and streaking Candy's hair, Beth coloured and did hers, and Carol put streaks in Michael's. I took lots of photos and we just howled at some of them. Candy was trying to look glamourous and decide which side of her head her now bright red hair should be parted on; the faces she made while trying to be serious had us all in stitches. We did have tea and a small slice of the delicious cake, and left much later than we planned to, arriving home at 11:30.</p>
<p>Despite having decided to being in bed in a half hour, we took our port into the living room. Big mistake. It's much too comfortable in there. We had opened the delicious port Bryn had collected from Brent during my last last hour at home last Sunday; it's very very good and we took our time drinking it. Finally Uncle Frank picked up the crossword book again, we started in on that, had a terrible time trying to fill in one corner, and ended up with more done than the other night... but it was 1:20 when we headed upstairs!</p>
<p>Lights out for me at 2 A.M. and slightly earlier for Uncle Frank.</p>
