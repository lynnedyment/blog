								<h2>A Movie, Visiting, and Happy Birthday to the Twins!</h2>
								<p>Uncle Frank and I had a movie date today; we left the house at 11:40 A.M. to see "The DaVinci Code" at Niagara Square. It has been playing here for at least three weeks; the theatre was almost empty, and so we settled into the first elevated front row seats and sat back to enjoy it. I had a big bag of popcorn, of course; I deliberately ate a small breakfast so that I could indulge. We both enjoyed the movie very much; we had read the book about the same time, and thought they did a decent job of it, although were glad that we had read the book for all the details that had to be left out.</p>
<p>We were halfway to Beth's at that point, it was warm and muggy, and the thought of sitting on Beth's porch was very appealing. She was sitting "burning the bottoms of her feet", as UF put it, when we arrived, and she claimed she had just that moment sat down. There was a lovely breeze blowing, and no signs of the muggy weather just a few miles down the road. UF had taken the rose spray out for Beth's newly planted two rose bushes, so she did that, and then gave us a tour of the massive stand of blueberry bushes, and the nicely growing vegetable garden. I picked leaves from three lettuces to take home for a salad, and Beth gave me two of their ripest plum tomatoes as well. </p>
<p>We sat in the kitchen and had tea and big bowls of melon, while Beth took a quick shower (she doesn't like to shower if she's alone!). We had been fooling around with our cameras for a while, testing out our "flower" buttons, and taking closeups of hands and watches. UF seems to have the best one for this, so I must read the instruction book and see what I am doing wrong. I tossed the ball to Reena for about fifteen minutes; she just loves to have some attention and I enjoy making her happy. UF had made friends with her earlier, and both he and I took some cute shots of her paying attention to him. </p>
<p>I called Gerry to invite her for dinner; we are in tonight, and eating leftovers, but tasty ones. Home at 5:30, heated up two pastas as I hadn't heard back from Gerry. UF suggested calling her again, and thank goodness I did, as she hadn't left a message accepting our invitation (she hadn't recognized the stranger's voice on his answering machine)! She came over a half hour later bearing four good servings of her wonderful eggplant parmigiana. She and I shared the two dishes. I made a salad using Beth's lettuce, our tomatoes, and a few balls of the fresh mozzarella I bought last week, and the final touch was a nice big serving of asparagus each. UF thoroughly enjoyed his dinner, as did we. They each had the last two slices of pumpkin pie and I had a bowl of strawberries with my tea. </p>
<p>UF had been cutting back the tops of the plants that have finished blooming and had started to weed, so while Gerry and I went through a big box of recipes, he finished up the garden area he had been working on. I kept most of AR's handwritten recipes for the dishes that I knew best, and also came across a couple written in Mom's handwriting, which I also kept. I will share these with my sisters for their albums. </p>
<p>Doug had a very successful day yesterday on his OneBag site, with over 50,000 hits! I showed Gerry how to access it, and also showed her many of the wonderful photos that Susan sent out today of Amelia, Riku, and Mirei. The two older children look so much longer to me and Mirei looks as though her legs are even chunkier than they were when I left... hard to imagine! Liz sent photos too, as did Gail yesterday, so it has been a great two days for seeing all those faces. </p>
<p>UF and I sat with our port, strawberries, and pistachios working on a crossword; it was an easy one tonight. UF had pulled, cleaned, chopped, and put on a pot of rhubarb to cook up; I decided to add a few bags of uncooked rhubarb from the freezer as it was a bit runny, and sadly found a freezer half-filled with unfrozen food in it! </p>
<p>By' had been using the wet-vac to clean up the water spill from last week, and unplugged the freezer. We decided it was just a sign that it was time to get rid of some things that had been there for too long anyway, and to start afresh. Uncle Frank has been busy cleaning it out, after we took everything out and deposited it in the garbage. It's not going to smell like roses in the garage for the next few days! </p>
<p>We also called Glenn, thinking he was celebrating his birthday at the trailer, but learned that he was in terrible pain with his back, and Wendy had brought him home. He sounded just terrible, with a soft low voice and obviously hurting too much to talk at all. Not a good birthday at all for him. </p>
<p>Gail was home and in good spirits but so sad to learn that her twin brother was hurting. She and Tom had had a lovely day out together, and of course she had lots of wonderful gifts to open and a perfect day celebrating her 59th birthday. We chatted on the "conference call" mode of UF's new phone, which was nice as we could both hear her in the kitchen, using just one phone.  </p>
<p>It's almost midnight so I'm going to close off and get to bed. I intended calling Riku and Amelia tonight, but the freezer took our extra time and now it's too late... night night.  </p>
<p>P.S. Ah, good intentions, but UF and I sat looking at all the photos Susan sent out today, and then had to go and check out the Mirei album to see her rolls, "anklets", and "bracelets" too. She was a chunky, smiling girl too, and it was such fun seeing that little face again. Bedtime? After 1 A.M.</p>
