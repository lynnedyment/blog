								<h2>Spa Sunday</h2>
								<p>Awoke at 8 A.M. today, and had two hours on the computer before Uncle Frank got up. Answered lots of emails and wrote up my blog. We had a very leisurely morning, not eating until noon hour; I made asparagus omelettes with red pepper, Vidalia onions, and cheddar cheese. We shared a very juicy mango, and UF said we must get more, as he so enjoys them in the morning. They were only 79 cents each at IGA last week, a price that is especially good here. UF says they are often almost $2 each. </p>
<p>We had intended going to a nursery for more red rocks, but instead, while Uncle Frank was on the computer, I did some laundry, and ironed almost all the clothes waiting for me in the basement, including clothes Candy forgot to take to Beth's on Saturday. </p>
<p>After that we started a crossword puzzle left from Thursday, when there are two in the paper. It proved to be a tough one, with lots of short but difficult words. Gerry was to have picked me up at 3:30, for our "spa day" at Donna's, but Candy was delayed while running errands in town with Beth and Paul. This gave me time for tea and a date square with UF, while working on the puzzle. </p>
<p>The spa day came about because last week Donna called everyone, wanting "the girls" to do something together. Dinner out was suggested, or a trip to St. Jacob's market, but it was Jamie's forthieth birthday yesterday so the latter was out, and we knew we would have more fun if there weren't restrictions on our time or really kicking back, as would be the case with a restaurant meal. I suggested a spa date at Donna's, as they have a lovely huge bathroom with a big whirlpool bath, and a beautifully decorated recreation room on the same level. </p>
<p>At 4 P.M. I was waiting in the front of the house when Shel' showed up; he and Ian have plans with Uncle Frank for the time I will be out today. </p>
<p>Gerry drove out the back way to Beth's and Paul's, turning on Lundy's Lane and meandering about the back roads. I lost track after three turns including a wrong one, but it was a pretty ride nonetheless. I just don't know my way around these back roads at all! Candy was waiting, and I saw Isaac with his newly dyed black hair (I like it, although no one else does... except him), and Michael with his newly streaked hair. They are having a pool day at their Neena's today, so Beth can't join us. She said she hoped to, but none of us had faith that it would happen. </p>
<p>Donna is a wonderful hostess and had snacks already laid out, wine cooled, the hot tub full and ready, and candles lit in the bathroom and the rec' room; it really looked (and smelled) lovely. </p>
<p>Candy, Lisa, and I got in the tub immediately; we had scented bubbles and with our legs stretched out carefully there was just room for the three of us. Candy and I had put a scrubber/exfoliant on our faces as we soaked too, and we had our wine beside us. The timer went off too soon for our liking so took a double turn. Donna let us get away with this, but told us she did have other clients waiting, and this would be the limit for us. </p>
<p>Donna, in her white top and navy pants (she had been golfing from 8 A.M.) looked the perfect spa attendent, and would come in occasionally when the laughter got a little too riotous, checking to see if all was well. Meanwhile, Gerry and Wendy were chatting and snacking in the rec' room, awaiting their turn. </p>
<p>Pizza and chicken wings had been ordered for dinner, so they decided to soak after we ate. We went upstairs to the lovely space they have off the kitchen, and stretched out on the sofa, chair, and floor, admiring Donna's brand new "waterwall", a new addition to the house. Shel' said it couldn't stay in the house all summer, as they have a dehumidifier running in the basement, but it did make a perfect addition to our spa experience today. Candles were also lit upstairs, and so the ambience was just perfect as we chatted and ate and laughed. It's just a good thing "the boys" weren't around! </p>
<p>The water wall has a copper roof on it, and somehow the topic came up about how to keep it clean once it goes outside. Candy said that she would show Donna how to do so easily, and promised a demonstration, if Donna had some ketchup! She ordered Donna to sit down, ordered me up to be her sidekick, and had me smear ketchup on half of a copper bottomed pot. I smeared and smiled and gestured while Candice went on about the wonders of ketchup and her vast knowledge of cleaning tips,  and then we went off downstairs again, to let the ketchup do its job. </p>
<p>Gerry and Wendy got in the hot tub next, and what a riot this was. They had fresh water and had more than their fair share of bubbles; they were everywhere, threatening to overflow the tub! The two of them started laughing, and with a hectic and stressful weekend behind her, the two glasses of wine Wendy had soon had her in stitches with the bubbles. Of course we were taking photos of all of this, so the two of them starting taking down the straps on their suits and posing with heads thrown back, looking rapturous, with bubbles up to their necks. Oh my, it was fun and funny! Can't wait to send those photos out... </p>
<p>Finally, we were all seated in the rec' room together, with Gerry and Lisa soaking their feet in the foot baths. Candy massaged Lisa's and Gerry's feet, and then it was time for Donna to relax. She kept insisting that she was there to take care of us, but we would have none of it, and insisted that she have a turn too; she hadn't gone in the bath. How she protested, but once her feet were in the swirling warm water she moaned away. She had foot surgery a couple of months ago and has really suffered with her feet over the past year or more.  I massaged her feet and lower legs for a long time, and she had us all in stitches with her moaning, and by telling us that she has never felt so wonderful and relaxed, etc., etc. Five minutes later she would be saying the same thing; it was hilarious. The pressure on her toes and up her arch were just so obviously pleasing, that I must say it was a pleasure getting such a reaction from her! </p>
<p>Beth came in just as all of this was going on, eyebrows raised, wondering just what Donna was moaning about! We were so surprised that she actually made it, and cheered when she came down. She so rarely takes the time out for herself either, so we soon had her feet in hot water too, and after a nice soak I massaged her feet for her. </p>
<p>About 8:30 P.M., feeling none the worse for wear(!), Wendy had Glenn come and pick her up, and Lisa left next, after we had Sheldon take some group shots of us upstairs. We started calling out words to make us laugh while he was using my camera, which turned out not to be a good idea, since he was laughing so hard his hands shook, and my photos are all blurry! Thank goodness we were behaving while he used Candy's camera as he got some great shots of us then. </p>
<p>At 9:30, Gerry, Beth, Candy, and I left, taking the highway this time out to the house. Gerry dropped me at home a half hour later. As we pulled up here the moon lights looked just beautiful in our perfectly decorated gardens. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank had been home for an hour, after a lovely afternoon and evening for him. He and Shel' had sat in the living room here and talked for a while; Sheldon brought over some four pound leg weights, and showed UF how to use them to strengthen his leg muscles. UF was quite impressed with them and plans to use them three times a day. Then he and UF met Ian at "Mick 'n Angelo's" for dinner. This is the same place we went to with Gerry and Lionel on Friday, and gave UF the opportunity to try the stuffed green peppers which had caught his eye then. Sheldon ordered the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer, which UF liked so much last fall when we ate there together, and with the big salad and hot bread, he brought most of his dinner home with him, enough for at least two very generous meals! Sheldon also has enough food for a nice big lunch today. </p>
<p>They all went back to Ian's after dinner, and UF thoroughly enjoyed this time with his two nephews; it doesn't happen often enough. Ian is also so gracious in his home, and a great host. UF had a Scotch there while they visited, and Shel' dropped him off at home at 9 o'clock.</p>
<p>When I arrived home, UF proudly showed me the completed crossword puzzle he had finished during his hour alone. It was a challenging one for sure; I wasn't sorry that I didn't have to think after my relaxing few hours! Since UF had a beer with his dinner and a drink at Ian's, we didn't have our port tonight. We do have a new bottle we picked up a few days ago, but instead might open the ice wine from Donna and Sheldon sometime in the next few days. </p>
<p>We had promised each other that we would start getting to bed earlier, so after two cookies each, and some "Sleepytime" tea for UF, we headed upstairs at 11:15. I wanted to check my emails (not checked since about 2 P.M. today), so UF said he would check his quickly while I washed. I emptied the dishwasher, folded laundry, washed, flossed and brushed, and got my bed ready, and UF was still busy on the computer, answering emails. </p>
<p>I came in to say goodnight, and was in bed reading at 11:45. UF apologized, feeling guilty about taking so long, but he had lots of mail in, and I was happy to just crawl into bed with my book. Lights out at 12:02! Yahoo! What a grand day we had...</p>
