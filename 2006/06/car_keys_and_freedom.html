								<h2>Car Keys! ... and Freedom</h2>
								<p>Candy had set an alarm for 5 A.M. but woke on her own twenty minutes before that; good thing too, as the alarm didn't go off at all. I joined her in the kitchen at 5:30, after she was packed up, ready to go, and drinking her coffee. We had a final half hour together before Gerry picked her up; I took a couple of photos, waved goodbye, and crawled back into bed. I left the light on and read and dozed until 8:15. </p>
<p>We were expecting the fellow from the car dealership to arrive this morning and so UF was awake early too. We had cold cereal and toast for breakfast, and were delighted when the fellow showed up with the key code and had a new key made in less than ten minutes; now we wish we had called yesterday! What a liberating feeling, knowing we could just pick up and go under our own steam from now on. </p>
<p>I had a little time on the computer while UF showered and talked with his sister Nina, who had called to see how he was doing. I went off to finish placing the red stones in the front garden, and watered the plants in the front and back gardens. </p>
<p>We were waiting for John to show up for the trimming UF wanted done; he came with his brother and in no time at all had done a great job taming the bushes and overgrown shrubbery, but alas, also managed to cut through the cable lines. We were having lunch while this happened, and I waited until we were on our way to see Dr. Fulton in St. Catherines before telling UF. John assured us they would come out to fix it up but of course we have no idea when that will be. </p>
<p>Despite leaving later than we planned, we were just a few minutes late for the 2:30 appointment. Dr. Fulton is quite a character, and a ladies man for sure; he had me come into his office, lay face down on the single "bed", while he demonstrated how I should "pull" UF's leg to loosen up some bone fragments. His receptionist was there too for the demonstration, and she went first. UF said this movement helped him, but Dr. Fulton has a lot of upper body strength and it hurt my ankle. I was glad to have the treatment over with! </p>
<p>From there we drove to Sears to look for a storm door, which they no longer cover. However, while waiting to learn this, I sat down to enjoy a massage pad, which felt just wonderful. UF tried it next and right on the spot decided to buy one. Turns out they are going on sale tomorrow, so we shall be back.</p>
<p>Neal is coming home with By' tonight, and he and UF are invited out for dinner at By's and Jo's; I was invited as well but decided to spend some time with Marie instead. We had just enough time to get out to Lococo's for fresh veg' and fruit, and then dashed home to unpack and start to mix up the pumpkin and spices for the two pies UF always makes for Nea' when he comes home. They arrived at just past 5:30, so we put the bowl in the fridge to finish up later and went our separate ways. </p>
<p>It was too close to dinner time to call Marie, and I decided I would love some time to wander around Niagara Square. I am so glad I did, as I found some great cotton capris and bought three pairs, as well as three sleeveless T-shirts. The dollar store was nearby, a huge one, and I found lots of goodies for the SF children: books, sparkly Play-Doh, animals, and tissue paper and other goodies for the house. </p>
<p>Tried to contact Marie, with no luck at all, so had a portobello mushroom burger at the A&W before heading home at 9 P.M. I was surprised UF and Neal weren't home, tried the key in the lock, convincing myself it didn't work (and I didn't want to force it), so did a little more mulch laying before they arrived fifteen minutes later. </p>
<p>Almost as soon as I got in, Kelly called inviting me to come to Toronto and do the 5K walk for prostate cancer with them all on Sunday morning. I will go up tomorrow at some point and spend one night with them all, returning to the Falls Sunday evening. </p>
<p>I filled the pie shells and made tea, Neal went off to bed, and UF and I did a crossword puzzle. Determined to get to bed earlier tonight, we said goodnight at 11:15. However, I took the time to take all the labels off my new clothes and had a little fashion show just for me. I love my lime green capris! Bed to read and lights out at 11:45 P.M.</p>
