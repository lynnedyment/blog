								<h2>A Lazy Sunday and Dinner Out</h2>
								<p>We had rain overnight, so the air felt fresh and cool this morning. Uncle Frank is still missing clear blue skies and sunshine, both of which have been absent since his return.</p>
<p>I had the whole morning on the computer, since UF slept on and on until 1 P.M.! By' dropped by with the two dogs to invite us for dinner tonight; I suggested that UF have the time with the family on his own (Jess' is just back from school in London), and I would arrange to spend some time with a friend.</p>
<p>I caught up on all the blogs since arriving here. Keeping notes in my calendar and checking sent emails made it easy to remember our days and evenings, and I had time to answer a few emails and update my address book on the server as well. My time was very well spent and I was glad to have it. Amelia had written again as well, so I am up to date with her too. Susan says she enjoys hearing back from me, so that makes it fun.</p>
<p>Uncle Frank and I had a generous omelette for our brunch at 2 P.M. I was so busy I hadn't even thought about food all morning, so we both enjoyed our late meal... sweet onions, red pepper, mushrooms, swiss chard, and cheddar cheese in the two eggs. We had only one piece of the small ww toast, as UF is to be at By's at 5 P.M.</p>
<p>Uncle Frank had a note to write to the therapist next door to take into the Shaver clinic with her tomorrow; we are all hoping that she can get UF in for some physio work before the two or three weeks she had originally said it would be. This has been very disappointing for him, as he thought it was all set up and that he would be at it last week.</p>
<p>I tidied up the kitchen and then sat and finished off the Carl Hiassen  novel I started on Tuesday. I brought some magazines with me as well to read through and discard, so got started on the first one of that pile.</p>
<p>I called Toronto, hoping to talk with all four children, but had no answer there, and there was no message on the machine when I came in. Seems odd to be so close and yet have no more contact with them than I do when home... in fact, less, since we don't have Skype here.</p>
<p>At 5 P.M. I dropped UF off at By' and Jo's. The sun had finally come out and they ended up eating on the deck. I had called Marie and invited myself for dinner; we sat and chatted and then Graham went out for a square pizza... not very saucy or cheesy at all, but more like thin toasty bread with a little tomato paste on it, but it hit the spot and it was fun to catch up with their lives and look at Marie's latest photo pages. This is a woman who is completely caught up on all her albums!</p>
<p>UF called at 8 o'clock saying he was ready to leave; he had forgotten to leave the letter for Donna next door for the physio, so rather than drop by Beth and Paul's for an impromptu visit, as I had thought we might, we came home. Donna said she would do her best and see if she can't get UF in earlier; he's ready to head back to Denver for the second surgery.</p>
<p>Off we went to the A&P, the grocery store open 24 hours a day, very close by. We had a long list of groceries to buy, in anticipation of cooking up three slow-cooker dishes, restocking on fruits and veggies, and buying some canned goods as well. It seemed like a lot of groceries for the house, but Candy will be with us for meals Tuesday through Friday and we are eating most of our meals at home. We took our time and strolled the aisles, which was great, as we spotted the canned custard we like with our rhubarb and a few items we would have forgotten. I unpacked them all and the cupboards are now well-stocked. </p>
<p>We had our now smaller glasses of port (we went through the first bottle far too quickly and are determined to make the delicious one from Brent, via Bryn, last longer), struggled over a few more words in the NY Times Crossword book, and headed up to bed at 11:15. I checked email quickly, and crawled into bed with my latest book, "Prodigal Summer" by Barbara Kingsolver. Read until midnight... UF still up at the computer.</p>
