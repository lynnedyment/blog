								<h2>"The Queen's Coach" ... and a Very Nice Surprise</h2>
								<p>Woke up this morning at 9 A.M. and with no Internet connection yet, the morning passed slowly with time for reading the paper, and chatting with Neal. </p>
<p>After UF arose and had his shower, it was overtime for our first meal of the day. Breakfast at "The Queen's Coach" is always Nea's first choice for all of his meals in the Falls; it's a very popular local spot, and apparently has been for years. We've been told that our Grandfather Rodgers used to drink there with friends after work, many many years ago. Friday night fish and chips there is a family tradition for many locals, and it's not unusual to run into someone you know no matter when you are there. </p>
<p>It was very quiet by the time we arrived at 11:30; the breakfast rush was long over and the lunch hour not quite started. Neal had a cheese omelette, UF the breakfast "special" of scrambled eggs with bacon and onions mixed in, and I my usual "basic" breakfast wherever I am, of two eggs over medium, homefries, and here... Italian toast. </p>
<p>We were sitting talking over our tea and coffee when a familiar face walked in... Elizabeth, Harry Lee's first wife, and mother of Kelsey! We recognized each other immediately and she came over and gave me the longest and biggest hug. Her dad has recently died, she is off work for a couple of weeks and told me that in going through some things in the house she had come across some of the letters I had written to her and to Kelsey many years ago. Elizabeth said she had oftened wondered how we all were, and of course I am always asking Ian or Harry how she and Kelsey are; I was sorry to have lost touch when she left the marriage. She seemed as delighted to have reconnected as I was, gave me her contact information, and I promised to get in touch next week. Elizabeth looks the same and was with her husband for lunch; I am hoping to see Kelsey too when I see Elizabeth.</p>
<p>We stopped at the local hardware store on our way home to look for a few more coleus for the front bed, to no avail, but did buy a new outdoor mat for the front door, and batteries that were on the list.</p>
<p>Neal and I worked a little more on insulating the wall plates while UF was busy on the computer; we were waiting for John to arrive to do some work in the house, but after a bit Neal asked about seeing Beth and I suggested that he and I scoot out while UF was waiting. UF agreed readily, and so off we went for a ride in the country. We timed the miles on the trip last week to pick Candy up, and it is exactly 11.4 miles from UF's garage to the end of the driveway at McKenney Road. </p>
<p>Neal's first words when he saw the house? "It's a mansion!" Beth showed him around the house and around the grounds while I took the opportunity to check my email downstairs in the cool office. It's a hot day today, but we sat in the shade on the porch for a half hour after I pulled a few weeds in the front beds. There was a lovely breeze blowing that we didn't have in the city.</p>
<p>Beth has a few "Rodgers" plants planted in the front flower beds,and we are all waiting to see what they look like when they flower; Beth found them at a nursery last week and Candy plans to get some for her house too. Carol drove Beth into town at 2:30, a little earlier than Beth usually leaves, so we were glad we had had some time with her.</p>
<p>John hadn't shown up, so UF left a message cancelling the work for today, and we all drove off to St. Catherines to pick up the massage mat UF had decided on yesterday. They had put one aside under his name, so that took only minutes and we were on our way back to the Falls immediately. </p>
<p>UF usually takes By' and family out for dinner on Friday nights, but they were busy with Jo's family tonight. Neal was keen on a second meal at "Queen's Coach," so 6 P.M. found us sitting in the same booth where Elizabeth and her husband sat this morning. I had the fish 'n chips (I like them better at "A Fine Kettle of Fish"), and ate the salad that came with Neal's spaghetti. UF had chicken cacciatore with penne, Italian bread, and salad, and brought half the main entree home with him for another meal. </p>
<p>People are <strong>big</strong> in Niagara Falls! We see lots of them at this restaurant but had it confirmed in the paper last week; Niagara Falls has more than the average numbers of smokers, overweight adults, and a higher illiteracy rate than the average Ontarioan. UF said that one look around the restaurant makes it easy for him to eat only a half portion! </p>
<p>At 7:45, UF and I were just heading out the door to the Bell Centre at Niagara Square to check out a new phone for him, when Glenn and Wendy walked up to the back door. It was lovely to see them and they came in for tea and pumpkin pie. First, though, they both did a walkaround of the garage, backyard, and house looking for the car keys for us. No luck, but we enjoyed the hour plus visit with them. Neal continued to put the light plates back on the wall in the rec' room, which I was cutting out and putting together while we chatted. </p>
<p>Neal went off to bed at his usual 9:30-10 P.M., and UF suggested I write my blog before we had our port. I did so, and was very pleased with it, and then lost it after changing <strong>one</strong> word and not saving it! Egad! We sat in the living room relaxing for an hour and I went right to bed instead of trying to redo it. I did make some brief notes though so it could be done later... </p>
<p>Special event! Amelia had her first BM in the toilet today! Susan sent the sweetest photo of a very proud Amelia flushing the toilet, so I took the time to write to Amelia telling her what a big girl she is. She has been quite a faithful little emailer and I had another in from her today as well. </p>
<p>Happy 34th Anniversary to Candy and Rick, who are settled into a lovely B&B tonight.</p>
