								<h2>A Cold and Rainy Friday</h2>
								<p>Brrr! I know it isn't as cold here as it is in Ottawa, Calgary, Nanaimo, or Toronto, but it's darned cold for San Francisco, and I am not enjoying it! Last week I spent three days sitting on the beach with Riku and Amelia and today it's 11C. I spent a quiet morning at home, catching up on emails, and tidying up from days of neglect this week. It rained off and on, with the sunshine appearing and disappearing, just as was forecast. However, at 12:40 it was raining very hard, and I realized that Akane would be picking up Riku from school with Mirei in the Baby Bjorn carrier, borrowed from Susan.</p>
<p>Riku had the beginnings of a cold yesterday and the day before, and I decided it made sense to pick him up in the car instead of having a long, and possibly wet, trek home... waiting for public transportation. </p>
<p>After Bryn and I had some lengthy IMs, he got in touch with Akane, and it was agreed that I would leave immediately to pick up Riku while Akane left with Mirei to find somewhere warm and dry to put in the afternoon. I was there twenty minutes later than usual, and a happy little boy came running out to meet me. He is such a joy, always; that face just beams with light! </p>
<p>I gave him his container of "snacks" and some soy milk for the trip home, and to my surprise he easily stayed awake for the twenty minute ride. We now look for the big cranes, and the poster of a boy with one octopus arm reaching around to hug him, and that helps, sometimes, to keep his attention diverted until we pull in the driveway. After a Thomas the Engine story, he was tucked into his warm and snuggly bed, with the newly named "Skippy", his favourite dog, and the spotted blanket he considers "his". </p>
<p>It was past time for my lunch (Doug had left, via the bus, to meet a fellow PEA member downtown) and so I stuffed a warmed mochi bun (from my bakery trip in Cupertino on Tuesday) with a delicious (sweet grass, raw milk) cheese, made a big cup of tea, and sat in the living room reading. </p>
<p>Riku napped for a full two hours, with a couple of brief wake-ups with a runny nose. He also has a little fever and is tossing more than usual. I spent the last ten minutes lying beside him as he quietly came 'round to waking. When he's ready to get up, he rolls over and puts his face very close to mine, and then smiles at me. Lovely. </p>
<p>I decided today was the perfect day for him to watch the "Wiggles" DVD we gave him for Christmas. He hasn't seen it yet, and he waited patiently while I made him some veggie and noodle soup with lots of broth for his nose. While I squeezed him some fresh orange juice, he got the tray out, carefully covered it with a tea towel, and off we went upstairs with a little veggie snack for me and his mid-afternoon snack. </p>
<p>The "Wiggles" was certainly fun; Donna had told me about them, and Riku liked it a lot, as much as Donna's Lauren does. There is lots of singing and some silliness, so that Riku was laughing out loud and moving his body around to the lively music... while eating his soup. We started to play with the farm once he lost interest in sitting; the rain was pelting down, and it felt like a perfect afternoon activity. </p>
<p>When I came down to get ready for our evening with Amelia, Riku stayed upstairs to continue playing with the farm. I was running the microwave, heating Doug's dinner, when Doug heard Riku crying. He had been calling out that "urine is coming!" and I hadn't heard him; he was so upset and retold the story over and over.... "Riku say "urine coming", Nana not come upstairs, Riku had urine, I sad ... Nana not hear me"... and on it went. Poor wee guy. Luckily he had on some nice thick soft jogging pants for comfort and they soaked up most of it. I got him all washed up, changed into his regular pants, and by the time he was all set, with clean underwear and warm again, his dad walked in for him. Riku got to tell his story all over again; he had perfected it whilst telling Doug his sad tale. </p>
<p>Doug and I dashed off for Ashbury Street, to find Amelia crying in the tub, when she realized we were there! Boo hoo! First time she has been upset when her parents left, but it lasted less than two minutes. We floated some animals in the tub, racing them, and soon she was bundled up in her towel, massaged with cream, and dashing in to tell Grandpa to get up out of his chair! </p>
<p>We arrived at 6:30 and while she and Doug played with the train set, I heated up her dinner, and proceeded to feed her while they played. She too has a cold and a little fever, but she ate very well considering how she must have been feeling. We read some books, watched a bit of a movie, and I started to tuck her in at 8:40... two more books, many songs, lots of head stroking, but not much success. </p>
<p>She was tired and fell into what seemed to be a deep sleep many times, but each time I tried to leave the room, she was up and wanting me to sleep with her. It was nice and cozy in the room, and I was fine sitting patiently, telling her about all the animals and people who were sleeping already, and then urging her to close her eyes and sleep too. By the time I left the room at 10 p.m. her parents were home from their movie! We chatted for a bit, and I was glad to hear that they both enjoyed "Walk the Line", despite Susan being cold and tired during the movie. It was that kind of a night, and Susan was overtired as well. </p>
<p>Home at 10:35, did lots of emailing, and went up to bed at 11:30, with two bed "buddies" nicely heated, ready to snuggle in and read.</p>
