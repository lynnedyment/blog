								<h2>Let Me Call You Sweetheart...</h2>
								<p>It's a holiday here today, President's Day, but my acupuncturist was open for business, which was perfect for me. I needed a treatment and was so happy to get in early this week. I walked to Valencia and 23rd, as it was cold but sunny, and I had no fresh air yesterday at all. That is not good, as Riku would say. Bryn was in the garage as I passed their house, and I stopped to say hello to Riku in the back seat of the car, on their way out to see Mari and run a few errands. I was happy to walk despite the offer of a ride, as I had timed it perfectly for a brisk, but not fast, walk. </p>
<p>I had a long session; my rib area felt sore and a lower side/back problem has been nagging at me long enough. I had lots of needles inserted in my back, hand, and knee, had the cups on for the first time in years, and also had electricity going between the needles which also feels good. I am sure I looked quite the picture but I fell asleep for about forty-five minutes with all of this gear and felt great when I walked out over two hours later. I think this gal is a miracle worker! I also have some Chinese herbs to take, which might help with muscle soreness. </p>
<p>I stopped in to pick up Riku and walk him to our house, almost an hour later than I expected to be there. We had our usual interesting walk between houses, finding some good sticks today, which Riku broke in half to share and then in half again. He was tired and wanted to be carried, but was happy with one long block, and didn't object to my putting him down again. He ate a small bowl of soup, some fresh strawberries, and had a drink before it was tuck-in time. We read a Caillou story at nap time today, about going to the dentist, and had a little chat about Riku's visit to the dentist in Japan in May. </p>
<p>He asked if I would stay in bed with him while he napped, and I told him "no", that I had things to do. His reply "Oh sweetheart, just stay here with me." ... pretty tempting, especially after he kissed my nose, but I resisted and left as soon as he drifted off. </p>
<p>I was <strong>so</strong> hungry by this time (just a half banana, a small handful of almonds, and some pomegranate juice for breakfast at 8 a.m.) so ate two of Akane's delicious inari, and had a big cup of tea, both of which hit the spot. Time for some emails and laundry and general tidying up while Riku napped, for two and a quarter hours. He is really stuffy from a head cold and was tired and more than ready for his nap. </p>
<p>I had hoped to get him outside this afternoon, while the sun was shining, but he was pretty low-energy, and so instead we made up some gingerbread dough mixture. Riku loves to help me cook, and stood stirring the butter and sugar mixture, then tasted the molasses as it poured out of the cup (he liked it too!), and helped level off the spices as I spooned them out. </p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon and early evening passed quickly... he prepared me a meal, and set the table so nicely asking what colour plate I would like with my egg, and then carefully choosing matching yellow cutlery and a cup too. He carefully put the cutlery on either side of the plate, and sprinkled my fried egg (a very real plastic fried egg though!) with pepper. The green play-doh came out and kept him busy for a while, and the "popper" toy, which Amelia uses almost every time she is here (but Riku seldom does), tore up an egg carton into a zillion pieces and then helped pick them up to deposit in the recycling, ate an orange after peeling it carefully on his own... and so went our time. </p>
<p>Riku wasn't terribly hungry, so over the course of the afternoon, after his nap, he had some toast, Canadian cheddar cheese (this is five year old cheddar and he came back for thirds!), mixed juice, a few mini tomatoes, and a bowl of oatmeal with blueberries. </p>
<p>After his cereal, he pointed out that it was very dark upstairs. He told me to go upstairs by myself (he's trying hard to overcome some fears) and as I started up decided he would accompany me. We went up together, holding hands, and I pointed out how it isn't really all dark... there is some light from the hall window, little lights in the bedroom on the clock, the receiver, the DVD player, and best of all, all the city lights... Sutro Tower with lots of blinking red lights, the stars, and plane lights shining in the big window. He agreed that it was beautiful. We went into the front guest bedroom after that, and it was <strong>very</strong> dark in there, with just a little trickle of light coming through the closed blinds. Riku has been using his flashlight from Auntie Gail and Uncle Tom a lot the past two weeks, but this time I think he wanted to see if the dark really was okay. </p>
<p>A long bathtime made him a happy boy, with all of his bath toys. Tonight he decided a rubber monster finger puppet wasn't so frightening after all, and he allowed it, and a little red octopus he had decided he didn't like either, to go in the tub with him. </p>
<p>We were sitting in bed at 7:20, reading "How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight", when the phone rang. It was his dad, with Mirei on the line, chatting away! She was amazing and kept it up for the longest time; I put the phone to Riku's ear and he smiled as he listened, and then asked "Mirei growing up now?" He talked some baby talk back to her and then said goodnight to his dad. I love it when he closes off a conversation, even on his pretend cell phone, as he nods solemnly as he listens, and then says "I love you" and gives a smack into the phone before hanging up. </p>
<p>Riku's stuffy nose made it hard for him to settle down; he needed it wiped several times, as he tossed and turned trying to find a comfortable spot. When I told him he had to stop wiggling soon, and settle down, he said "I like wiggling". Fair enough... </p>
<p>Emails, a couple of notes written, some IM time with Kelly, and I am off to read for a bit before heading to bed earlier than usual. Riku is very stuffy and coughing so he may be up early in the morning.</p>
