								<h2>Tuesday at Home</h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 6:30 a.m. today after a fairly restless night; he was having trouble finding a comfortable spot it seemed, and was so stuffy. He awoke coughing a couple of times too, turning to try to sleep with his head on the side of my face!, and then turning around and around like a dog on the bed, trying to settle in when I moved him. </p>
<p>However, he woke me with a big smile, which is such a sweet way to wake up. He turned the little "telephone" light on, and wanted me to open my eyes and say "too bright! too bright!" How funny that even when he tells me what to say, it makes him laugh anyway! We snuggled quite a while without worrying about the time. He likes our little "nest" and scrunches down beside me chatting away. </p>
<p>Finally I popped out of bed, turned the heat on and peeled him an orange, so he could snack on that while I had my shower. I put on a video we have called "Snowplows at Work"; he has only seen it once and it kept him interested while I had a very quick shower. Downstairs to get him dressed, and to play with Play-Doh while I cooked his oatmeal with blueberries. He ate the whole bowl, and since we still had some time to fill in before his 8:40 pick-up for school, we went downstairs to investigate a daddy-long-legs spider who has taken up residence on the stairway going down to the door. Together we blew at him a bit; Riku was delighted to see him move, and I told him that spider was scared of us, that he thought we were giants and there was a big storm blowing him around. He found this very engrossing and continued to blow gently on him while I tidied up the kitchen. By the time Bryn arrived the spider has disappeared, much to Riku's disappointment. We had a good look for him, but he was nowhere to be found. </p>
<p>Bryn emailed later to say that Riku had cried when he was left at school today. Poor sweet baboo; I hope his cold disappears soon. I had asked if I could have Amelia after her nursery school today, but she too still has her cold, and is throwing up a bit after coughing very hard. Guess it's going around... </p>
<p>I dashed off at 9 a.m. to take part in phase two of the Vitamin D study I am involved with at Mt. Zion hospital. The gal was late for our appointment, so I arrived home just shortly after 11 a.m. I am to keep track for two weekdays and one weekend day of every bite I eat, and record the amounts too. This should keep me on the straight and narrow! </p>
<p>The day flew by with various and boring chores... cleaning and clearing out the laundry room, answering emails (I am getting down to the last 75), finishing up this week's laundry, taking some time out to read and enjoy my tea, and general puttering about. </p>
<p>Glenn had his prostate surgery today and I was anxiously awaiting word that he was out of the operating room; Candy emailed about 4 p.m. that all went well. Phew! I was very worried about him, as I knew he was dreading it. Candy and I talked on Skype for quite a while and then later in the day, Gail and I did as well. Don and I connected for a moment too; the whole family was waiting for news. Glenn is now home, which is a good sign, and I'm sure he is happy he didn't have to stay in overnight. Six weeks of bed rest follow; that will be hard for him.</p>
<p>Doug Skyped later on in the evening; he has his new glasses ordered and a passport should be ready for him on Friday as well. Myk' and Bryant are on their way to Mexico tomorrow with their mother and grandmother so I emailed them a bon voyage message. </p>
<p>Bedtime at 11 p.m.... leaving the laundry room not quite finished. Must go through some of the toys and put away the ones Amelia and Riku  no longer play with; Mirei will enjoy them a year or so from now.</p>
