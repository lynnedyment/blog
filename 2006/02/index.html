								<h2><a href="/2006/02/a_hundred_kisses.html">A Hundred Kisses</a></h2>
								<p>Since Riku got back from Japan, I have been giving him lots and lots of kisses. We are spending more time together playing on the bed with his cars, and inevitably we end up rolling around at some point. Two weeks ago, I started kissing him, and as he giggled, I told him I was going to give him a hundred kisses. And so it has continued... not a hundred kisses for sure, but I start off counting really quickly, pecking little kisses all over his head, face, and neck, and then speeding up with the counting and kissing his arms and chest. He loves it, and now I don't even have to start the kissing before he starts giggling. Tonight, as I had him ready to tuck into bed, he told me he was going to give me a hundred kisses!... and proceeded to kiss my face, quickly, as I finished reading to him. What a guy! </p>
<p>This has been a busy day with an early start. Doug had a flight to Boston at 6:30 a.m. out of Oakland, which meant my getting up at 4:40 for a 4:50 departure. However, my internal alarm went off at 4:10, giving me far more time than I needed to pull on my clothes. I was back home at 5:45, and crawled back into bed, which I had kept warm with two bed "buddies" popped in just before leaving the house. They worked, as I slept from 6-7:30 a.m. </p>
<p>We had a lovely day today. Bryn dropped Riku off at 9:20, I had our lunches packed, and at 10:15 we met Susan and Amelia at the SF Zoo. Clear, bright, sunny day, perfect for the children to poke sticks into bushes, and oh yes, to see some animals too. Amelia loves to climb and managed to hoist herself up on even the slippiest stone structures! She's amazing... </p>
<p>They were both short on sleep, so after some running around, more poking about, admiring the penguins doing porpoise leaps!, and lunch at the cafe, we all headed back to the cars at 1 p.m. Riku asked to go on the carousel, and since it is not something we get to do often, we did so. He beamed all the way 'round and 'round, on his bright steed with red markings. </p>
<p>I wasn't out of the parking lot before Riku was asleep; he slept in the car for an hour and twenty minutes, while I sat in a shady spot near the house, reading the newest non-fiction Joan Didion book. I'm loving it, and was happy to sit while Riku napped. </p>
<p>Home for snacks, making "toilet paper" out of Play-Do!... don't ask me, it's a strange thing, which involves pulling apart the dough into tiny little pieces and scattering them about the table. Today he wanted me to play "toilet paper" too; I seemed to get it right, as he was very pleased with my little scatterings. He made us a nice "meal" in the new kitchen... lots of fruit, bread, and homemade "soup" from the metal soup kettle Doug and I gave him for Christmas. Water time in the sink, with his rubber and plastic animals, brought us to dinner time, after admiring the men next door working on the roof and sending lots of debris down a big tube. </p>
<p>I also videotaped him chatting away to himself and singing along with Raffi before I joined him at the table. I don't use the video camera often enough and must keep it on this floor to use more frequently with Amelia and Riku. </p>
<p>Bath time after dinner; he had a nice long soak, and his daddy came in to say goodnight to him before going off to play ping-pong. Riku wanted him to put his hand in the water, reassuring him it was warm, and not hot.</p>
<p>After I wrapped Riku in his big towel, warm from the dryer, he told me he wanted to snuggle for a long long time. We did. I think it's a little ritual we both enjoy so very much. </p>
<p>For tonight's bedtime story Riku chose "Mike Mulligan", a classic children's book about a man and his steam shovel, from 1939. It has been reissued and Riku likes it a lot. </p>
<p>Night night...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/02/happy_birthday_mykayla_and_ano.html">Happy Birthday Mykayla! and Another Hundred Kisses</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke up at 6:20 this morning; he tried hard to fall asleep again, and I tried hard to help him get there too, but eventually he kissed my nose, and then told me he was going to kiss me one hundred times! What a sweet boy he is. Of course, I started to laugh just as he does when I tell him this, as it tickles him, and so our day began. </p>
<p>He wanted some "nest" time, but mostly he wanted to cuddle a bit before getting out of the warm bed. I turned on the heat and dressed him pretty quickly, as the house was cold! Brrr! </p>
<p>I couldn't feed him enough today. He started off with a half banana and some fresh strawberries at 7 a.m. with some apple juice, and by 9 a.m. had finished an adult-sized portion of nine-grain hot cereal with blueberries. When I was sitting eating my fried egg and toast at 10:30 a.m. he asked where his was, after I had dipped his slice of toast into my egg yolk. He ate his own fried egg, two slices of "bacon" and almost a second slice of toast. That little tummy of his was big and round! </p>
<p>Riku said he wanted "privacy" in the bathroom this morning, as he did yesterday as well. I shut the door and listen for the flushing before going in to attend to the parts he can't manage on his own yet, which includes getting off the toilet! </p>
<p>This morning we made a cave and a small house out of Play-Doh, and sat for a long time pretending there were a bear and two cubs in the cave, and people in the house. No toilet paper today, thank goodness, as I am much better at figuring out what bears and people do, than toilet paper! </p>
<p>We watched Caillou together this morning, and Riku decided, after seeing Caillou and his grandmother make cookies, that he should make cookies for his daddy, as Caillou had. The intention was to bake some brownies, as they would be faster than cookie baking, but my eye caught a recipe for a lemon loaf and we made that instead. We had picked two fresh lemons from the Meyer lemon tree on the boulevard across the street so it seemed a perfect way to use them up. </p>
<p>What a treat this was; I must do it more often with both Amelia and Riku. Riku enjoyed every aspect of the whole experience... from spinning the plastic turnaround on the mixer (while I melted the butter), to adding the last drop of milk at the end of the process. I think his favourite part of all, though, was sliding the kitchen knife across the top of the cup to level the flour. His eyes just lit up, although he sure liked helping me sift the flour, baking powder, and salt too! He took it all quite seriously, and helped me with each step of it, right to the pouring and scraping of the batter into the pan. Perhaps he will be a chef when he grows up. </p>
<p>While the cake baked, Riku and I watched the men working on the roof next door, pouring down the old shingles and tarpaper into a huge funnel. Riku craned his neck so he could see the men on the roof and watch the man in the truck wielding his shovel after it all piled up. He did a little drawing, using the big smooth crayons-in-a-roll stick that Kelly sent home for the children. They both like them a lot although it changes the way that Riku draws as it allows him to fill in a huge area very quickly. No more tiny and very precise little patterns; we are into a whole new art form now! </p>
<p>While the cake was cooling, an hour later, Riku helped me poke holes into the top of the cake so that we could pour the lemon juice and sugar over the top. It was too hot to take home with him, but Bryn picked it up after work tonight. It tasted pretty good to me (I sliced one thin slice off the end of it); I hope they like it on Hampshire Street too. </p>
<p>Riku was to spend the day at home today as we are back to our Monday, <br />
Wednesday, Friday routine with him. I thought we would start back next week but Bryn insisted that we do so this week, so off we went at 11 a.m.</p>
<p>It was hot outside! I had tossed on a light jacket and Riku had a sweater on over his T-shirt but neither of us needed the extra layer. It was like a spring day out there today! Bryn told me later that he and Ted had gone for a walk on their lunch hour, as it was so gorgeous. This was an Ocean Beach day for sure, and I won't be surprised if I hear that Amelia and Susan were there after naptime today. Riku meandered home, in his relaxed ambling way, checking out all the sights along the way. Today we saw a bomb squad car; that makes two in one week! </p>
<p>We arrived at his home a half hour later(!) in time to see Mirei sound asleep in her mommy's arms. Akane told me that Mirei is having trouble settling into sleep and doesn't sleep soundly, a probable result of the side-effect of the stronger steroid she is now on. Poor wee girl. She is a bonny baby, and looked so content when I was there. Akane thinks she is probably weighing close to twelve pounds now! I managed to put her into her little seat while Akane had a few minutes with Riku, but apparently she woke up immediately after I left. </p>
<p>I strolled home, enjoying the warm and sunny day, but got right to work on the paper work taking up too much space on the kitchen counter... still! Worked my way through more than half of that, made some phone calls, napped on the sofa for a half hour after finishing the wonderful Joan Didion book, talked to Myk' and sang "Happy Birthday" to her... twelve today!, made myself a big bowl of soup for my dinner, went through over a hundred and twenty-five emails, talked to Glenna, and to Bryn when he came to pick up his mail and the loaf. He spent a few minutes with some suggestions about getting cheaper car and house insurance, and went home to his busy little family. </p>
<p>Bed time now... 11 p.m. Productive day, but I hope to be up in the morning getting even more done tomorrow!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/02/ahhh_california.html">Ahhh, California!</a></h2>
								<p>Despite the rocky start -- a late start with Riku, twenty minutes spent getting gas, an accident on the freeway (but not involving us, so there's a plus!), and a closed exit to Susan's involving a slow drive to the Golden Gate Bridge -- Riku and I finally made it to the Bay Area Discovery Museum in Sausalito, an hour and a half later than I intended being there. </p>
<p>It was such a gorgeous day, that even though Riku was a little grumbly in the car (almost drifting off at 10:30 on our commute), I decided that once he was able to run around and play in the sun he would be fine. And he was!</p>
<p>Amelia and Susan were already there, and after a little outside blackboard drawing time, the children decided to do separate activities. Amelia was anxious to do some painting inside the art area, and Riku headed off to the big climb-aboard boat, one of his favourite activities here. He clanged the bell, steered the big wheel into unknown waters, and carefully climbed in and out and around the boat, holding on to the ropes to get to the back and the front. At one point a bigger boy shoved him; Riku was in tears, and the boy was made to apologize by his mom. Riku talked about this on the way home, saying the boy was "angry" and pushed him. </p>
<p>Riku had been a little "angry" in the car himself, telling me that he didn't like -- and there followed a list of everyone in his life! -- anymore! He used a big voice to tell me that too. When I suggested he was a little tired and perhaps we should go the park instead of the museum, he made it clear that that wasn't what he wanted. At the end of our day together though, he told me he had been angry "in the morning" and said "I sorry". Apology accepted. Interesting to see that he brought it up and apologized on his own, as we hadn't discussed his anger the rest of the day. </p>
<p>Our two and a half hours there flew by! Amelia joined Riku at the big gravel pit, filling trucks and loaders, using hands and shovels. There were lots of moms and caregivers, myself included, looking like mother birds, as we popped bites of food into them during all of this action. One woman asked if I would do the same with her little guy, as it was working so well with Riku. </p>
<p>Finally though, we decided a picnic at the tables was in order, and we all ate the remainder of lunch sitting in the warm sunshine. What a day it was! I think we were going to have another temperature-breaking day, or close to it, today. Yesterday was equally beautiful. </p>
<p>One final runaround on the boat, and Amelia was ready for her nap. She seemed tired today too, so she and Susan went off, and Riku had some painting time inside as he had been promised. He stood next to a little girl who thought Riku was part of the easel, so thank goodness the paint washes out! </p>
<p>I took Riku's shoes and socks off, stripped him down to a short-sleeved T-shirt, and he was asleep by the time we were on the Golden Gate Bridge coming home. I found a lovely spot to park in Golden Gate Park, right beside a waterfall. I thought the sound would be better than the sound machine we use here at home, and it was. He napped for almost two hours, while I read, and then, since we were so close to Ocean Beach, decided that was the perfect way to end our day together. We stopped to pick up some snack supplies: a sandwich for me, fresh fruit mix for Riku, and a bag of oatmeal raisin cookies. </p>
<p>For the next two hours we sat on the beach, making (me), and breaking up (Riku) castles. Riku was happy sitting and finding lots of wet sand by digging deep down, making a road with his red plastic car, finding feathers!, and basically just enjoying the whole experience. We spent some time watching a big cruise ship going one way, and a container ship going the other, keeping an eye on the latter to ensure it really wasn't going to crash into Seal Rock. Riku always likes to know too, when we're near water, or looking at pictures of water, if there are "jelly fish in there?".</p>
<p>We sang songs all the way home. Favourites at the moment include the ever-popular "Five Little Ducks" by Raffi... with Riku sounding ever so sad when they all swim away, and then joyously grinning when they all come back! We have just relearned an old favourite of mine from years ago, about buying current buns in a baker's shop. Both Riku and Amelia like it and we sing it at least two times a day when we're together. </p>
<p>I dropped Riku off at 5:30, which was perfect timing as Akane had just finished up the laundry at our house. Bryn had dropped her off this morning with Mirei and they had a quiet day here together. Mirei is having some side effects from the stronger steroid and didn't sleep much last night; Akane said she made up for it today, as she slept a lot when she was here. </p>
<p>The rest of my evening flew by; I answered some emails while making a hot cup of tea and some popcorn for dinner, and then gave in to sitting and catching up on Oprah tapes, too lazy to come downstairs to get at something else. However, Doug is running out of tapes, so I justified it by solving this at least! </p>
<p>Doug and I IMed a few messages back and forth about the Grammies which he was watching in Boston, and I got through a few more emails before heading up to bed to read at 11:30 p.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/02/a_cold_and_rainy_friday.html">A Cold and Rainy Friday</a></h2>
								<p>Brrr! I know it isn't as cold here as it is in Ottawa, Calgary, Nanaimo, or Toronto, but it's darned cold for San Francisco, and I am not enjoying it! Last week I spent three days sitting on the beach with Riku and Amelia and today it's 11C. I spent a quiet morning at home, catching up on emails, and tidying up from days of neglect this week. It rained off and on, with the sunshine appearing and disappearing, just as was forecast. However, at 12:40 it was raining very hard, and I realized that Akane would be picking up Riku from school with Mirei in the Baby Bjorn carrier, borrowed from Susan.</p>
<p>Riku had the beginnings of a cold yesterday and the day before, and I decided it made sense to pick him up in the car instead of having a long, and possibly wet, trek home... waiting for public transportation. </p>
<p>After Bryn and I had some lengthy IMs, he got in touch with Akane, and it was agreed that I would leave immediately to pick up Riku while Akane left with Mirei to find somewhere warm and dry to put in the afternoon. I was there twenty minutes later than usual, and a happy little boy came running out to meet me. He is such a joy, always; that face just beams with light! </p>
<p>I gave him his container of "snacks" and some soy milk for the trip home, and to my surprise he easily stayed awake for the twenty minute ride. We now look for the big cranes, and the poster of a boy with one octopus arm reaching around to hug him, and that helps, sometimes, to keep his attention diverted until we pull in the driveway. After a Thomas the Engine story, he was tucked into his warm and snuggly bed, with the newly named "Skippy", his favourite dog, and the spotted blanket he considers "his". </p>
<p>It was past time for my lunch (Doug had left, via the bus, to meet a fellow PEA member downtown) and so I stuffed a warmed mochi bun (from my bakery trip in Cupertino on Tuesday) with a delicious (sweet grass, raw milk) cheese, made a big cup of tea, and sat in the living room reading. </p>
<p>Riku napped for a full two hours, with a couple of brief wake-ups with a runny nose. He also has a little fever and is tossing more than usual. I spent the last ten minutes lying beside him as he quietly came 'round to waking. When he's ready to get up, he rolls over and puts his face very close to mine, and then smiles at me. Lovely. </p>
<p>I decided today was the perfect day for him to watch the "Wiggles" DVD we gave him for Christmas. He hasn't seen it yet, and he waited patiently while I made him some veggie and noodle soup with lots of broth for his nose. While I squeezed him some fresh orange juice, he got the tray out, carefully covered it with a tea towel, and off we went upstairs with a little veggie snack for me and his mid-afternoon snack. </p>
<p>The "Wiggles" was certainly fun; Donna had told me about them, and Riku liked it a lot, as much as Donna's Lauren does. There is lots of singing and some silliness, so that Riku was laughing out loud and moving his body around to the lively music... while eating his soup. We started to play with the farm once he lost interest in sitting; the rain was pelting down, and it felt like a perfect afternoon activity. </p>
<p>When I came down to get ready for our evening with Amelia, Riku stayed upstairs to continue playing with the farm. I was running the microwave, heating Doug's dinner, when Doug heard Riku crying. He had been calling out that "urine is coming!" and I hadn't heard him; he was so upset and retold the story over and over.... "Riku say "urine coming", Nana not come upstairs, Riku had urine, I sad ... Nana not hear me"... and on it went. Poor wee guy. Luckily he had on some nice thick soft jogging pants for comfort and they soaked up most of it. I got him all washed up, changed into his regular pants, and by the time he was all set, with clean underwear and warm again, his dad walked in for him. Riku got to tell his story all over again; he had perfected it whilst telling Doug his sad tale. </p>
<p>Doug and I dashed off for Ashbury Street, to find Amelia crying in the tub, when she realized we were there! Boo hoo! First time she has been upset when her parents left, but it lasted less than two minutes. We floated some animals in the tub, racing them, and soon she was bundled up in her towel, massaged with cream, and dashing in to tell Grandpa to get up out of his chair! </p>
<p>We arrived at 6:30 and while she and Doug played with the train set, I heated up her dinner, and proceeded to feed her while they played. She too has a cold and a little fever, but she ate very well considering how she must have been feeling. We read some books, watched a bit of a movie, and I started to tuck her in at 8:40... two more books, many songs, lots of head stroking, but not much success. </p>
<p>She was tired and fell into what seemed to be a deep sleep many times, but each time I tried to leave the room, she was up and wanting me to sleep with her. It was nice and cozy in the room, and I was fine sitting patiently, telling her about all the animals and people who were sleeping already, and then urging her to close her eyes and sleep too. By the time I left the room at 10 p.m. her parents were home from their movie! We chatted for a bit, and I was glad to hear that they both enjoyed "Walk the Line", despite Susan being cold and tired during the movie. It was that kind of a night, and Susan was overtired as well. </p>
<p>Home at 10:35, did lots of emailing, and went up to bed at 11:30, with two bed "buddies" nicely heated, ready to snuggle in and read.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/02/chatty_mirei_and_a_snuggle.html">Chatty Mirei and a Snuggle</a></h2>
								<p>Today was a busy day out and about for Doug and me. He went off for his 10 a.m. T'ai Chi class and I managed to get through lots of emails in a couple of hours before he arrived home. We both had noon appointments with the eye doctor. Good news for me; once again my long distance vision has improved and I needed to order weaker lenses for my sunglasses, now five years old. And a bonus, I still don't need reading glasses, for which I am very grateful. Partly this is due to my having small pupils which allows me to focus more clearly than I would normally be able to. Doug plans to buy new glasses in Toronto so needed to get his prescription; we each paid $35 for a new test which sees into the back of the eye, and both had good reports. </p>
<p>From there we walked in the rain to buy chocolates for Kelly and Gregg at Joseph Schmidt, running into Mari as we stood deciding that we were indeed standing where she must be living now... and we were right! She was glowing after a nice long run in the rain. </p>
<p>Lunch at a new-to-me burrito place followed. Doug discovered it while I was in Ontario, and it was delicious... we each had a burrito with smoked tofu, pineapple, mushrooms, rice, and peanut sauce... a Thai burrito! I didn't even save half for tomorrow, and it was a bargain at $5.25. It really hit the spot and I will be back.</p>
<p>From there we hit Costco, Rainbow, Trader Joe's and Safeway before finally arriving at home around 5 p.m. I didn't need any dinner, and Doug had a bowl of barley soup with added goodies in it; nice for me as it only needed heating up. </p>
<p>We both got busy on the computers and hadn't been working long when Bryn called to see if we would like to have Mirei here for a visit while they went out for a noodle dinner with Riku. Oh yes! She had been nursed, and was awake when they brought her over; such a treat! She was awake longer tonight than she has been ever; she looked at all the bright folk art chickens in the living room, stared at the same light over our bed that always fascinated Riku, took full notice of the black and white cat in Riku's room from Auntie Kelly and Uncle Gregg, and paid notice to the hanging mobiles in his room too. But the best part of all was all the chatting she did! Lots of oohs, and ahhhs, and exchanges of sounds lobbed to and fro from us. Mirei just smiles the biggest smiles and it is such fun to see! Finally, after all this excitement she was exhausted and needed some cuddling to get to sleep. I placed her in the chair in the living room and read while watching her peacefully sleeping. She awoke just as her family came in. </p>
<p>I thought Bryn would just scoop Mirei up and dash home, but they all came up after Riku had asked if I could read him a story. Perfect timing, as Susan had given me a book about "Baby Beluga" with all the words from the main verse and chorus, and Riku was delighted with it. When Bryn told him it was time to go home, he protested, saying "I just want to snuggle with Nana". Doug was watching "Corpse Bride" while I was downstairs with Mirei, so we snuggled while Riku watched a few minutes of that. He is a snuggly boy for sure, and really wriggles into a nice snuggling position! They went off home shortly after that, with the DVD in hand to watch in the morning. </p>
<p>Doug and I decided to watch the last half of a music documentary we had started to watch a couple of nights ago, but I drifted off while Doug gave me a much needed back rub. Twas lovely! </p>
<p>More emails and then early to bed... about 10 a.m. as 4:30 a.m. will come early. Doug is flying to Toronto at 6 a.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/02/a_chilly_sunday_at_home.html">A Chilly Sunday... at Home</a></h2>
								<p>The day started off very early, waking at 4:15 a.m. while Doug did the final packing for his trip to Toronto. I drove him to the airport, leaving at 4:50, and was back in bed at exactly 5:30, nice and cozy with the heated bed buddies tucked in before I left. Surprisingly, I was asleep almost instantly, after reading for about a minute and a half, and slept until 8:30. The house was <strong>cold</strong>, and I was reluctant to get out to turn on the heat! Brrr! </p>
<p>I had a quiet but productive day at home, busy with various projects... cards, general tidying, and working my way through lots of emails. I am down to just 75, down from 630 three weeks ago. There is finally light at the end of the tunnel. </p>
<p>I took advantage of the quiet house and sat and read through some magazines while drinking the new Trader Joe's chocolate-flavoured tea. Yum! It's subtle and delicious, and a nice change from my usual black tea. </p>
<p>Did a little IMing with Kelly. Doug had arrived, and we exchanged a couple of emails before he went off to have dinner with Kelly, Gregg, Myk', and Bryant. They leave for Mexico on Wednesday, so he won't be seeing them after tomorrow. </p>
<p>Seemed very quiet around here today without a child's voice even once in my day. </p>
<p>Up to bed to read at 10:40, bed buddies in hand... cold again tonight.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/02/let_me_call_you_sweetheart.html">Let Me Call You Sweetheart...</a></h2>
								<p>It's a holiday here today, President's Day, but my acupuncturist was open for business, which was perfect for me. I needed a treatment and was so happy to get in early this week. I walked to Valencia and 23rd, as it was cold but sunny, and I had no fresh air yesterday at all. That is not good, as Riku would say. Bryn was in the garage as I passed their house, and I stopped to say hello to Riku in the back seat of the car, on their way out to see Mari and run a few errands. I was happy to walk despite the offer of a ride, as I had timed it perfectly for a brisk, but not fast, walk. </p>
<p>I had a long session; my rib area felt sore and a lower side/back problem has been nagging at me long enough. I had lots of needles inserted in my back, hand, and knee, had the cups on for the first time in years, and also had electricity going between the needles which also feels good. I am sure I looked quite the picture but I fell asleep for about forty-five minutes with all of this gear and felt great when I walked out over two hours later. I think this gal is a miracle worker! I also have some Chinese herbs to take, which might help with muscle soreness. </p>
<p>I stopped in to pick up Riku and walk him to our house, almost an hour later than I expected to be there. We had our usual interesting walk between houses, finding some good sticks today, which Riku broke in half to share and then in half again. He was tired and wanted to be carried, but was happy with one long block, and didn't object to my putting him down again. He ate a small bowl of soup, some fresh strawberries, and had a drink before it was tuck-in time. We read a Caillou story at nap time today, about going to the dentist, and had a little chat about Riku's visit to the dentist in Japan in May. </p>
<p>He asked if I would stay in bed with him while he napped, and I told him "no", that I had things to do. His reply "Oh sweetheart, just stay here with me." ... pretty tempting, especially after he kissed my nose, but I resisted and left as soon as he drifted off. </p>
<p>I was <strong>so</strong> hungry by this time (just a half banana, a small handful of almonds, and some pomegranate juice for breakfast at 8 a.m.) so ate two of Akane's delicious inari, and had a big cup of tea, both of which hit the spot. Time for some emails and laundry and general tidying up while Riku napped, for two and a quarter hours. He is really stuffy from a head cold and was tired and more than ready for his nap. </p>
<p>I had hoped to get him outside this afternoon, while the sun was shining, but he was pretty low-energy, and so instead we made up some gingerbread dough mixture. Riku loves to help me cook, and stood stirring the butter and sugar mixture, then tasted the molasses as it poured out of the cup (he liked it too!), and helped level off the spices as I spooned them out. </p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon and early evening passed quickly... he prepared me a meal, and set the table so nicely asking what colour plate I would like with my egg, and then carefully choosing matching yellow cutlery and a cup too. He carefully put the cutlery on either side of the plate, and sprinkled my fried egg (a very real plastic fried egg though!) with pepper. The green play-doh came out and kept him busy for a while, and the "popper" toy, which Amelia uses almost every time she is here (but Riku seldom does), tore up an egg carton into a zillion pieces and then helped pick them up to deposit in the recycling, ate an orange after peeling it carefully on his own... and so went our time. </p>
<p>Riku wasn't terribly hungry, so over the course of the afternoon, after his nap, he had some toast, Canadian cheddar cheese (this is five year old cheddar and he came back for thirds!), mixed juice, a few mini tomatoes, and a bowl of oatmeal with blueberries. </p>
<p>After his cereal, he pointed out that it was very dark upstairs. He told me to go upstairs by myself (he's trying hard to overcome some fears) and as I started up decided he would accompany me. We went up together, holding hands, and I pointed out how it isn't really all dark... there is some light from the hall window, little lights in the bedroom on the clock, the receiver, the DVD player, and best of all, all the city lights... Sutro Tower with lots of blinking red lights, the stars, and plane lights shining in the big window. He agreed that it was beautiful. We went into the front guest bedroom after that, and it was <strong>very</strong> dark in there, with just a little trickle of light coming through the closed blinds. Riku has been using his flashlight from Auntie Gail and Uncle Tom a lot the past two weeks, but this time I think he wanted to see if the dark really was okay. </p>
<p>A long bathtime made him a happy boy, with all of his bath toys. Tonight he decided a rubber monster finger puppet wasn't so frightening after all, and he allowed it, and a little red octopus he had decided he didn't like either, to go in the tub with him. </p>
<p>We were sitting in bed at 7:20, reading "How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight", when the phone rang. It was his dad, with Mirei on the line, chatting away! She was amazing and kept it up for the longest time; I put the phone to Riku's ear and he smiled as he listened, and then asked "Mirei growing up now?" He talked some baby talk back to her and then said goodnight to his dad. I love it when he closes off a conversation, even on his pretend cell phone, as he nods solemnly as he listens, and then says "I love you" and gives a smack into the phone before hanging up. </p>
<p>Riku's stuffy nose made it hard for him to settle down; he needed it wiped several times, as he tossed and turned trying to find a comfortable spot. When I told him he had to stop wiggling soon, and settle down, he said "I like wiggling". Fair enough... </p>
<p>Emails, a couple of notes written, some IM time with Kelly, and I am off to read for a bit before heading to bed earlier than usual. Riku is very stuffy and coughing so he may be up early in the morning.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/02/tuesday_at_home.html">Tuesday at Home</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 6:30 a.m. today after a fairly restless night; he was having trouble finding a comfortable spot it seemed, and was so stuffy. He awoke coughing a couple of times too, turning to try to sleep with his head on the side of my face!, and then turning around and around like a dog on the bed, trying to settle in when I moved him. </p>
<p>However, he woke me with a big smile, which is such a sweet way to wake up. He turned the little "telephone" light on, and wanted me to open my eyes and say "too bright! too bright!" How funny that even when he tells me what to say, it makes him laugh anyway! We snuggled quite a while without worrying about the time. He likes our little "nest" and scrunches down beside me chatting away. </p>
<p>Finally I popped out of bed, turned the heat on and peeled him an orange, so he could snack on that while I had my shower. I put on a video we have called "Snowplows at Work"; he has only seen it once and it kept him interested while I had a very quick shower. Downstairs to get him dressed, and to play with Play-Doh while I cooked his oatmeal with blueberries. He ate the whole bowl, and since we still had some time to fill in before his 8:40 pick-up for school, we went downstairs to investigate a daddy-long-legs spider who has taken up residence on the stairway going down to the door. Together we blew at him a bit; Riku was delighted to see him move, and I told him that spider was scared of us, that he thought we were giants and there was a big storm blowing him around. He found this very engrossing and continued to blow gently on him while I tidied up the kitchen. By the time Bryn arrived the spider has disappeared, much to Riku's disappointment. We had a good look for him, but he was nowhere to be found. </p>
<p>Bryn emailed later to say that Riku had cried when he was left at school today. Poor sweet baboo; I hope his cold disappears soon. I had asked if I could have Amelia after her nursery school today, but she too still has her cold, and is throwing up a bit after coughing very hard. Guess it's going around... </p>
<p>I dashed off at 9 a.m. to take part in phase two of the Vitamin D study I am involved with at Mt. Zion hospital. The gal was late for our appointment, so I arrived home just shortly after 11 a.m. I am to keep track for two weekdays and one weekend day of every bite I eat, and record the amounts too. This should keep me on the straight and narrow! </p>
<p>The day flew by with various and boring chores... cleaning and clearing out the laundry room, answering emails (I am getting down to the last 75), finishing up this week's laundry, taking some time out to read and enjoy my tea, and general puttering about. </p>
<p>Glenn had his prostate surgery today and I was anxiously awaiting word that he was out of the operating room; Candy emailed about 4 p.m. that all went well. Phew! I was very worried about him, as I knew he was dreading it. Candy and I talked on Skype for quite a while and then later in the day, Gail and I did as well. Don and I connected for a moment too; the whole family was waiting for news. Glenn is now home, which is a good sign, and I'm sure he is happy he didn't have to stay in overnight. Six weeks of bed rest follow; that will be hard for him.</p>
<p>Doug Skyped later on in the evening; he has his new glasses ordered and a passport should be ready for him on Friday as well. Myk' and Bryant are on their way to Mexico tomorrow with their mother and grandmother so I emailed them a bon voyage message. </p>
<p>Bedtime at 11 p.m.... leaving the laundry room not quite finished. Must go through some of the toys and put away the ones Amelia and Riku  no longer play with; Mirei will enjoy them a year or so from now.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/02/kisses_and_hugs.html">Kisses and Hugs</a></h2>
								<p>Hoping Amelia's cold would be a little better today, I emailed Susan last night asking if she Amelia could come over for a playdate with me today. I was delighted that she could indeed, and Susan dropped her off around 9:30 a.m. </p>
<p>We had thought of going to the playground, as Amelia had suggested it when I opened the door to her this morning, but our three hours flew by at home. What kept us busy? Sifting flour and soda for the gingerbread dough Riku and I started a couple of days ago, mixing it up with our hands, which Amelia just loved, squeezing and kneeding away like an old pro. She also "washed up", splashing about in the largest bowl with soap and bubbles, using the cloth to clean the spoons and measuring cups, etc; she did a great job!  Then it was time to pedal Riku's tricycle around the house and she managed to use the pedals for a few turns. Mostly though she liked to push with her feet.</p>
<p>Once she had finished up her second breakfast from home, we went outside and gardened; the sun was warm and the garden needed attention. Amelia was such a good little helper and pulled weeds, helped put the leaves in the bag, and watered the plants with many refills of the elephant watering can. She was just adorable with a pink satin ribbon in her hair, looking very dainty, but taking the gardening very seriously... broom over her shoulder like an old pro', really pulling out the weeds with vigour! and enjoying her little cracker snacks outside on the little stool. What a sweetheart this little girl is. </p>
<p>I showed her the falling girl on the computer and it intrigued her as much as it did Riku last week. Uncle Frank sent it on to us, and they watch the girl falling over and over onto big bubbles and then we get to rescue her when she gets stuck. While she did this I plied her with her fruit mixture from Susan, bananas and apple slices. </p>
<p>She played with the green Play-Doh, her number one choice of colour each time, while I fed her a little "lunch"... she wasn't hungry but ate a half a waffle with maple syrup and butter, and drank almost a whole container of orange juice. While she was sitting there, she looked over at me and said "I love you <strong>so</strong> much Nana!" and gave me a big hug. I enjoyed my time with her so much; it really did fly by. </p>
<p>Susan was waiting for her at 12:50 when I pulled up to the house; of course she had goodies for me... a sheet of the new children's book stamps and new Crayola twistable pencils for the children's "art" table.</p>
<p>Riku came running out, with a big happy face as usual, when I picked him up from school, and we had a merry ol' time singing on the way home. I had been singing "She'll be Coming 'Round the Mountain" to Amelia, which delighted her, as her mommy sings it to her, but it was new for Riku and he wanted to sing it many times. I could see he was close to drifting off, so I opened the windows and sang away and we made it almost all the way home, within two blocks, before he gave in to sleep. He had only napped a half hour yesterday after Akane picked him up in the stroller, so he was more than ready to catch up today. </p>
<p>We had a pretty sad forty minutes, as he cried when I took him out of the car and then reacted with anger until I finally settled him down for what turned out to be a more than two and a half hour nap. I wasn't at all surprised, and even when he woke after that point, I opened his door and told him he could join me in the kitchen... and he stayed in bed for another fifteen minutes. When I went in to get him, he wanted to be wrapped in his special blanket and cuddled for about fifteen minutes. Poor sweet baboo. </p>
<p>I was rolling gingerbread during the end of his nap time, and he ate a warm cookie fresh from the oven, before agreeing to get dressed. His first request was that we play together on the bed with his cars, so we did that, which is where his dad found us when he arrived at 5:15. Riku wasn't at all ready to go home, he wanted to play with his animals in the sink first, so Bryn suggested that he stay over with me tonight. He had work he wanted to do and so we did this. Riku played with his animals for the longest time, chatting away to himself all the while. I went back to rolling out the cookies and he watched me put the eyes, buttons, belt, and arms and legs on them, before suggesting they needed noses. Noses added. </p>
<p>He pieced away at his "snack" tray, which hadn't interested him when he first woke up... two cookies did though, so I fed him strawberries, bananas, thin carrot sticks, cherry tomatoes, and Canadian cheddar cheese sticks while he played. He likes the old cheddar very much, which pleases me no end! </p>
<p>Bath time followed; tonight for the first time he asked me for his "safe cloth", for his eyes before I washed his hair. Bryn had told me about this term, and it is just too clever; it is certainly a safe way to wash his hair and keep the water/shampoo out. </p>
<p>He always puts all his bath toys in the tub, which means it's pretty darned crowded in there. Tonight he was putting the alphabet letters on the side of the tub, and found all the letters for his name. Just for fun I put them in the wrong order, and then pronounced them the way they were; he laughed so hard as RIKU became KURI or URKI. It was hilarious and we spend several minutes at it.  </p>
<p>There was enough time for Riku to do some drawing, using the new pencil crayons from Auntie Susan, and we sang along with Raffi for most of the evening. He ate a small bowl of oatmeal with blueberries, and drank two cups of his current favourite juice... mango, orange, and carrot. </p>
<p>Just after that, on a whim, I acted out blowing bubbles and Riku realized what I was doing. He pretended he was driving a car and was delighted when I guessed it. From there I went to blowing up a balloon and then decided to get out a real one. What fun we had; I showed him how to make it squeal, then he tried, and also tried to blow it up himself. He managed to do so, but then sucked the air back down! We blew it up several times and then let it blow madly about the kitchen, which made him laugh out loud once more. </p>
<p>After that he made me a quick "dinner", all veggies on a green plate, with a green fork, knife, and spoon carefully placed beside the plate. What a guy! At 8:10 it was tuck-in time.  </p>
<p>We read "Baby Beluga" from Auntie Susan, and while I was lying down beside him he asked if we were "cuddled up snug" in our bed. During the snuggling time he leaned over three times and kissed me soundly on the cheek. He also apologized for knocking over the lamp on his bedside table when he was angry. This is the second time he has apologized for something which had happened earlier in the day, and which hadn't been mentioned since the incident. </p>
<p>... and that's it. I shall finish with a comment from Bryn today. When he took Riku into the school this morning, Riku, as usual, chose his stickers for his daily record book. Today he chose two 2s, and put them in the right box for the 22nd of February, neatly side by side</p>
<p>He just woke at 11:15 with a bad dream about "ebi", shrimp in English, but settled back down immediately with just a little stroke on his wrist. However, it is bedtime for me... night night.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/02/amelia_and_friends.html">Amelia and Friends</a></h2>
								<p>I had sent Susan an email last night, wondering if Amelia could come over after nursery school today. Chatted with Susan early, and was happy to learn that it was going to work out. </p>
<p>Spent the morning catching up on emails, and getting a few cards ready to send out for next month. My mornings pass by quickly, filled with lots of little chores in the house. </p>
<p>However, I was out the door at 12:15 to pick up Amelia. She burst into tears when she saw me; I had been warned by Susan that she was tired, so knew she was expecting her mom or at least disappointed that I wasn't her. However, by the time we walked outside the school to the car, she was her amiable little self, and ready to talk about what story we would read at home, after her snack, and before her nap. </p>
<p>Well, the nap never actually happened today. I thought it might have, and wondered at times if it had, but finally had to admit defeat. Amelia settled in so nicely, burrowing down into the duvet, breathing heavily (always a good sign), but the minute I turned to leave the room, she was objecting to needing to nap. I settled her in again, singing, rubbing her forehead, until I heard her taking those nice deep breaths, letting me believe she was asleep. Nope! We went through the whole routine again, with Amelia insisting this time that she was all ready to wake up! And once more, I tucked her in, settled her down, she cried for two minutes and then all was silent. I had the monitor on, and couldn't hear a thing. Twenty minutes later she called out, I went in to find she had a dirty diaper... a good reason for not falling asleep... and had obviously spent lots of time moving dozens of books from the bedside table to the bed! I couldn't believe how quietly she did this. Of course, once I got the diaper changed, Amelia was all ready with her story about having had a good sleep, and telling me it was time to get up now. This time I snuggled in next to her, and spent fifteen minutes watching her watch me, so up we got! I knew she was tired but she was not going to give in. </p>
<p>Amelia played with the green Play-Doh, messed about in the little kitchen, rearranging the plates and pots and pans, and at 4 p.m. we headed out to the playground. I had called to see if Akane could bring Riku over but Bryn called to say she was on her way to Ivonne's and Diego's. Too bad. However, Amelia was just delighted to see her friend from daycare (actually, <strong>the</strong> boy she has a big crush on... Alexander. He was obviously delighted to see her too, and when I asked if I could take their photo, Alexander promptly posed beside her with an arm thrown over her shoulder! There was another little boy there as well, and they were running all over the playground keeping tabs on one another. </p>
<p>At one point I looked over, and Akane, with Mirei in her Baby Bjorn front pack, Riku, Ivonne, Diego, and Mateo, in his Baby Bjorn, were just entering the playground. It was such a treat to have them all there playing together. Riku hadn't napped more than a half hour, so as he always does when he is tired, he spent more time on his own, pushing a found truck around, or sitting in the sandbox. He did join the other four children once in a while, but he seemed quite content doing his own thing too. </p>
<p>We were all there until 6 p.m. when they were locking up the gate; Susan had joined us about 5:15, bringing me a bag of food goodies from Rainbow. I peeked in and changed my mind about having soup for dinner; how she spoils me! </p>
<p>All the children were tired, so off with their mommies they went, and I drove off home on my own. I immediately decided to eat three very delicious stuffed Greek grape leaves; there is a word for these but I'm tired enough I can't think of it! I made tea and sat upstairs watching taped Oprahs, intending to watch one show and then come downstairs and get busy. I woke up at 11:30! with the tape run out and feeling chilly. Brrr. Down I came, heated up my bed buddies and off I went to bed. What a fun afternoon I had with Amelia!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/02/rainy_sunday_with_bryn_and_rik.html">Rainy Sunday with Bryn and Riku</a></h2>
								<p>Riku came paddling up to my room at 6:15 a.m. It was still dark but I had turned off my light at 10:45 last night and slept very well. He didn't need to do any more than stare at me for a few seconds, and I was awake and happy to see his smiling wee face. He had carried up a cup of yogurt and a spoon, telling me he would have his medicine after he ate something. He crawled into my warm "nest", snuggling up to me, and assuring me that his ear "feels good". What a sweet pleasure he is. In the dark, he toddled over to find a book to read to me, but couldn't quite manage to even see the pictures. We decided instead to go downstairs, turn on the heat and play there. </p>
<p>Bryn was working at the computer already, preparing his notes for his naturalization papers for U.S. citizenship. Riku wanted to play on his bed with his cars, so we had all of them spread all over, but he neatly sorted them into categories... fire trucks, cars with "eyes"...  big cars, and all the others in one big line up. It was quite a decision whether a police fire truck belonged with the fire trucks or with the "regulars" but it finally went with the fire department, even though it was the only blue one. </p>
<p>Riku has been doing lots of "patterning" lately, sorting the alphabet letters on the fridge into four colour sets, or making sure that if he gives me a yellow plate when making me "dinner" he also gives me yellow cutlery and a cup. That little mind is just going all the time. </p>
<p>Usually in the mornings Riku eats a very good breakfast but this morning he wasn't interested much... ate about 2/3 of the peach yogurt, but only a couple of strawberries, and two hours later only half of his usual amount of hot cereal. At 8:45 he and his dad left to pick up croissants for breakfast at home. Akane is nursing both Mirei and a bad cold, so I suggested that Bryn bring Riku back over for his afternoon nap if he liked. </p>
<p>I showered, made the beds, started a load of laundry, made myself a poached egg, two slices of toast, two slices of "bacon", and of course my big mug of hot chocolate. I am writing down everything I eat today for the last of my Vitamin D study for UCSF, but with my slightly sore throat over the last two days (but gone today), I had eaten less than usual, with no tea and milk. </p>
<p>Gail and I talked a long time on Skype this morning; Glenn wrote that he was feeling a little cranky on day four of his post-prostate surgery, and other than that it was a quiet email/computer morning. I didn't get to the ironing as I had intended, but had a very relaxing time and enjoyed it. </p>
<p>I had volunteered to have Riku here for his nap, and so at 1 p.m. he and Bryn arrived in the pouring rain. Riku always needs to play "for just a few minutes" and he immediately got busy preparing "dinner" for me at the table. He is so good; he pours me "tea" and knows I don't like sugar in it, but is generous with the milk. When I asked for butter on the corn-on-the-cob, he said "Oh, I not have butter; sorry. I just pretend, here you go!", carefully spreading some "butter" on my corn. </p>
<p>At 1:35, after reading "Caillou Plans a Surprise" for the third time in less than a day, Riku was sound asleep, and stayed asleep for three hours and ten minutes! When he awoke that last time, I went in prepared to get him up -- opening the blind, turning off the sound machine, and leaving the door open -- but he stayed in bed another fifteen minutes, just lying there curled up. Bryn had a peek at him, and of course we had to admit he was just so sweet lying there, with his dog in his arms and his favourite cotton blanket (from Tracy Gerster when her girls outgrew it), so I snapped a photo. He didn't even move. Finally, he called out again and had that big smile ready, a sure sign that he has had enough sleep. Good thing; it was 5 p.m.! </p>
<p>I had made us all snack plates of fruit and veggies; Bryn had a bagel with some good Canadian cheddar Doug had found here in the city (not an easy task). Riku spotted the cheese and asked for some; he is a Canadian cheddar kind of guy and says it out just like that... "I like some Canadian cheddar cheese". We carried it upstairs so he could show his dad the snowplow video.. "Come on! Let's do it!" taking Bryn by the hand and heading for the stairs. While he watched a bit of that and then worked on a puzzle with us, we fed him orange sections, tomatoes, apple slices, banana chunks, and a few skinny carrot sticks. </p>
<p>Bryn was ready to go home, but Riku insisted he was hungry, so I got a whole wheat flax seed waffle ready for him, with a little butter and maple syrup, and once he polished that off they headed for home, in a really hard downpour, at 6:10. </p>
<p>I heated up the half of my burrito from last night, and took it upstairs with one of the little Cokes Susan bought for me last week, and sat watching Oprah. However, once that was done, I got up, plugged in the iron and finished off the very last shirt, that has literally been hanging around since mid-January! Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Bryn managed to find and document all of his trips out of the U.S.A. over the past four years, thanks to my calendars, Kelly's emails, and Susan's help... the trinity, I suppose, of organization! He ended with a grand total of 19 international itineraries involving 11 countries: Mexico, Guatemala, Haiti, Ireland, U.K., Canada, Cuba, Australia, France, and hmmm, two others...  </p>
<p>Emails, folded laundry, bedtime... 11:45 p.m.</p>
