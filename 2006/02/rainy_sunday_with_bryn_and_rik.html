								<h2>Rainy Sunday with Bryn and Riku</h2>
								<p>Riku came paddling up to my room at 6:15 a.m. It was still dark but I had turned off my light at 10:45 last night and slept very well. He didn't need to do any more than stare at me for a few seconds, and I was awake and happy to see his smiling wee face. He had carried up a cup of yogurt and a spoon, telling me he would have his medicine after he ate something. He crawled into my warm "nest", snuggling up to me, and assuring me that his ear "feels good". What a sweet pleasure he is. In the dark, he toddled over to find a book to read to me, but couldn't quite manage to even see the pictures. We decided instead to go downstairs, turn on the heat and play there. </p>
<p>Bryn was working at the computer already, preparing his notes for his naturalization papers for U.S. citizenship. Riku wanted to play on his bed with his cars, so we had all of them spread all over, but he neatly sorted them into categories... fire trucks, cars with "eyes"...  big cars, and all the others in one big line up. It was quite a decision whether a police fire truck belonged with the fire trucks or with the "regulars" but it finally went with the fire department, even though it was the only blue one. </p>
<p>Riku has been doing lots of "patterning" lately, sorting the alphabet letters on the fridge into four colour sets, or making sure that if he gives me a yellow plate when making me "dinner" he also gives me yellow cutlery and a cup. That little mind is just going all the time. </p>
<p>Usually in the mornings Riku eats a very good breakfast but this morning he wasn't interested much... ate about 2/3 of the peach yogurt, but only a couple of strawberries, and two hours later only half of his usual amount of hot cereal. At 8:45 he and his dad left to pick up croissants for breakfast at home. Akane is nursing both Mirei and a bad cold, so I suggested that Bryn bring Riku back over for his afternoon nap if he liked. </p>
<p>I showered, made the beds, started a load of laundry, made myself a poached egg, two slices of toast, two slices of "bacon", and of course my big mug of hot chocolate. I am writing down everything I eat today for the last of my Vitamin D study for UCSF, but with my slightly sore throat over the last two days (but gone today), I had eaten less than usual, with no tea and milk. </p>
<p>Gail and I talked a long time on Skype this morning; Glenn wrote that he was feeling a little cranky on day four of his post-prostate surgery, and other than that it was a quiet email/computer morning. I didn't get to the ironing as I had intended, but had a very relaxing time and enjoyed it. </p>
<p>I had volunteered to have Riku here for his nap, and so at 1 p.m. he and Bryn arrived in the pouring rain. Riku always needs to play "for just a few minutes" and he immediately got busy preparing "dinner" for me at the table. He is so good; he pours me "tea" and knows I don't like sugar in it, but is generous with the milk. When I asked for butter on the corn-on-the-cob, he said "Oh, I not have butter; sorry. I just pretend, here you go!", carefully spreading some "butter" on my corn. </p>
<p>At 1:35, after reading "Caillou Plans a Surprise" for the third time in less than a day, Riku was sound asleep, and stayed asleep for three hours and ten minutes! When he awoke that last time, I went in prepared to get him up -- opening the blind, turning off the sound machine, and leaving the door open -- but he stayed in bed another fifteen minutes, just lying there curled up. Bryn had a peek at him, and of course we had to admit he was just so sweet lying there, with his dog in his arms and his favourite cotton blanket (from Tracy Gerster when her girls outgrew it), so I snapped a photo. He didn't even move. Finally, he called out again and had that big smile ready, a sure sign that he has had enough sleep. Good thing; it was 5 p.m.! </p>
<p>I had made us all snack plates of fruit and veggies; Bryn had a bagel with some good Canadian cheddar Doug had found here in the city (not an easy task). Riku spotted the cheese and asked for some; he is a Canadian cheddar kind of guy and says it out just like that... "I like some Canadian cheddar cheese". We carried it upstairs so he could show his dad the snowplow video.. "Come on! Let's do it!" taking Bryn by the hand and heading for the stairs. While he watched a bit of that and then worked on a puzzle with us, we fed him orange sections, tomatoes, apple slices, banana chunks, and a few skinny carrot sticks. </p>
<p>Bryn was ready to go home, but Riku insisted he was hungry, so I got a whole wheat flax seed waffle ready for him, with a little butter and maple syrup, and once he polished that off they headed for home, in a really hard downpour, at 6:10. </p>
<p>I heated up the half of my burrito from last night, and took it upstairs with one of the little Cokes Susan bought for me last week, and sat watching Oprah. However, once that was done, I got up, plugged in the iron and finished off the very last shirt, that has literally been hanging around since mid-January! Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Bryn managed to find and document all of his trips out of the U.S.A. over the past four years, thanks to my calendars, Kelly's emails, and Susan's help... the trinity, I suppose, of organization! He ended with a grand total of 19 international itineraries involving 11 countries: Mexico, Guatemala, Haiti, Ireland, U.K., Canada, Cuba, Australia, France, and hmmm, two others...  </p>
<p>Emails, folded laundry, bedtime... 11:45 p.m.</p>
