								<h2>A Hundred Kisses</h2>
								<p>Since Riku got back from Japan, I have been giving him lots and lots of kisses. We are spending more time together playing on the bed with his cars, and inevitably we end up rolling around at some point. Two weeks ago, I started kissing him, and as he giggled, I told him I was going to give him a hundred kisses. And so it has continued... not a hundred kisses for sure, but I start off counting really quickly, pecking little kisses all over his head, face, and neck, and then speeding up with the counting and kissing his arms and chest. He loves it, and now I don't even have to start the kissing before he starts giggling. Tonight, as I had him ready to tuck into bed, he told me he was going to give me a hundred kisses!... and proceeded to kiss my face, quickly, as I finished reading to him. What a guy! </p>
<p>This has been a busy day with an early start. Doug had a flight to Boston at 6:30 a.m. out of Oakland, which meant my getting up at 4:40 for a 4:50 departure. However, my internal alarm went off at 4:10, giving me far more time than I needed to pull on my clothes. I was back home at 5:45, and crawled back into bed, which I had kept warm with two bed "buddies" popped in just before leaving the house. They worked, as I slept from 6-7:30 a.m. </p>
<p>We had a lovely day today. Bryn dropped Riku off at 9:20, I had our lunches packed, and at 10:15 we met Susan and Amelia at the SF Zoo. Clear, bright, sunny day, perfect for the children to poke sticks into bushes, and oh yes, to see some animals too. Amelia loves to climb and managed to hoist herself up on even the slippiest stone structures! She's amazing... </p>
<p>They were both short on sleep, so after some running around, more poking about, admiring the penguins doing porpoise leaps!, and lunch at the cafe, we all headed back to the cars at 1 p.m. Riku asked to go on the carousel, and since it is not something we get to do often, we did so. He beamed all the way 'round and 'round, on his bright steed with red markings. </p>
<p>I wasn't out of the parking lot before Riku was asleep; he slept in the car for an hour and twenty minutes, while I sat in a shady spot near the house, reading the newest non-fiction Joan Didion book. I'm loving it, and was happy to sit while Riku napped. </p>
<p>Home for snacks, making "toilet paper" out of Play-Do!... don't ask me, it's a strange thing, which involves pulling apart the dough into tiny little pieces and scattering them about the table. Today he wanted me to play "toilet paper" too; I seemed to get it right, as he was very pleased with my little scatterings. He made us a nice "meal" in the new kitchen... lots of fruit, bread, and homemade "soup" from the metal soup kettle Doug and I gave him for Christmas. Water time in the sink, with his rubber and plastic animals, brought us to dinner time, after admiring the men next door working on the roof and sending lots of debris down a big tube. </p>
<p>I also videotaped him chatting away to himself and singing along with Raffi before I joined him at the table. I don't use the video camera often enough and must keep it on this floor to use more frequently with Amelia and Riku. </p>
<p>Bath time after dinner; he had a nice long soak, and his daddy came in to say goodnight to him before going off to play ping-pong. Riku wanted him to put his hand in the water, reassuring him it was warm, and not hot.</p>
<p>After I wrapped Riku in his big towel, warm from the dryer, he told me he wanted to snuggle for a long long time. We did. I think it's a little ritual we both enjoy so very much. </p>
<p>For tonight's bedtime story Riku chose "Mike Mulligan", a classic children's book about a man and his steam shovel, from 1939. It has been reissued and Riku likes it a lot. </p>
<p>Night night...</p>
