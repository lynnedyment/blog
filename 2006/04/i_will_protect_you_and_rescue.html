								<h2>"I Will Protect You and Rescue You"</h2>
								<p>Lazy morning again, with a little reading time in bed before I got up. Typical morning for the first bit of it... emails, shower, breakfast, read the paper, and started the laundry. </p>
<p>By 9:30 I was anxious to know whether Uncle Frank had passed his driving test, so I called him. He was home; Glenn had taken him for it, in case he failed and had to be driven home, but he passed with flying colours! I am so pleased but not nearly as pleased as he was; he had taken two lessons and felt they really paid off in terms of his confidence and new found skills. Yahoo! We had a very long chat about his upcoming trip to Denver, and then mine not too long following that, the latest children stories, and various other interesting things. Time flies when we're chatting away, as always. </p>
<p>Doug came with me to pick up Riku; he came bounding out, first one up the stairs and greeted me with that big smile. I got a hug around the neck and we stayed so I could see Sophie, a little girl he has talked about with Akane. I commented to him that she has long hair and he said "yes, just like in 'Howl's Moving Castle'". Turns out there is a character in the movie called Sophie; this has me confused for a couple of days until Bryn filled me in on this. </p>
<p>Today on the way home we noticed barbed wire, and razor wire... Grandpa told us this... and of course Amelia's playground, the massive blue crane near his school, and various billboards along the highway. Grandpa had to stop quickly at one point, which made Riku laugh out loud so hard, that Grandpa did it a few more times just so we could hear that laugh. He drank a whole container of vanilla soy in about three minutes on the way home, and ate 3/4 of a banana. Good food for sleeping! </p>
<p>One of the things Riku is learning is everyone's full names. He now knows that he is John Riku Dyment (he has known this for some time), and also knows that his daddy is John Bryn Dyment, that Grandpa is John Douglas Dyment and that I am Lynne Dyment. He knows his name in Japan is Riku Goda. It's such fun seeing these little ones ingesting all this information and storing it away. </p>
<p>He asked for "just five minutes" to play with Grandpa when we got home. I gave him seven, so that they had time to get upstairs and start building a "huge tower" that was on the agenda. We also had two stories today and then he was ready to settle down. Easy as can be, he was asleep within seven minutes and slept for an hour and a half. I like these 3:30 awakenings, as they make for an easier and earlier bedtime. </p>
<p>Bryn and I were IM-ing for a bit while Riku slept, and I saved a portion of the conversation to remember... here it is:</p>
<p>bryn says: Riku gave a loving goodbye to Mirei in the kitchen this morning<br />
Lynne says: awww... what an amazing little brother he is<br />
bryn says: then, when we were in the outside hallway, he climbed back up a few stairs because he wanted to say goodbye again<br />
bryn says: while he was doing it, akane and i were looking at each other in amazement<br />
Lynne says: he loves her and she loves him... they've bonded<br />
bryn says: i think it's the cheeks<br />
Lynne says: i think it's the smiles</p>
<p>Gail called and we had some time, but not quite enough, for a little chat before Riku wanted me off the phone. He gets a little bossy and tells me to "say goodbye now"; he did this last week too. However, he did say goodbye to her too and said "I love you", which I notice he does when he is on his toy cell phone too. This is a Dyment and Rodgers family tradition and it looks like it will be passed on through this branch of the family too. </p>
<p>Riku played upstairs for a bit, but then asked me to carry the tower downstairs. He asked me to put on his "soft" pants today, and not the jeans he had been wearing. I keep a couple of pairs of soft, thick cotton pull-on "joggers" for him here, and he likes them, just as his cousins in Toronto do. </p>
<p>Riku was playing with play-doh, making me "dinner" when I served him his... mac' and cheese, which is now how he refers to it as well. I had added carrots, celery, mushrooms, spinach, and lots of tomatoes to it, and he ate a huge bowl, much more than I expected. He had had a full container of yogurt earlier, so I was surprised at his appetite. However, the stronger antibiotic seems to be doing the trick with his cough; I didn't hear it once today, and noticed his sinuses are clear too; he is breathing more easily than I have heard him in months. For dessert he had some Devon cream pudding with strawberries, with a plate of strawberries and grapes after his bath. </p>
<p>I wrote out a few cards and notes this afternoon, and Riku asked what I was doing. When I told him he said he would write a letter to Auntie Kelly; I gave him a notecard and he "wrote" a letter on one side and drew her a picture on the other. He told me the letter said "Dear Auntie Kelly. I like you sooooo much!" He also drew her a big X and O on it too, when I told him they meant a hug and a kiss. I dashed off to mail it at the hospital along with my mail. </p>
<p>Oh, when he was ready for his bath, he ran around being a "run around naked boy" like Brynnie used to be! He doesn't usually do this, but tonight he even got hold of the broom and started sweeping the floor for me. I took some great shots but Doug had the card out of the camera and I missed them all. No, I didn't see that it was telling me there was no card! Darn! </p>
<p>By 7:10 he was all ready for bed, sitting at the table doing a numbers puzzle and a Ravensburger farm puzzle; he is so much better than I am at them! His daddy came in for a quick goodnight hug and kiss, and we admired the pink streaky sky while waving goodbye to him. </p>
<p>Tuck in time was at 7:40, and we read two stories: "Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!", which makes him smile at each page, after reading an old familiar favourite, "Franklin and His Special Blanket". It has been months since we read it; it's a tiny pop-up book and I think he was happy to see it and hear it again. </p>
<p>He took longer to settle than I expected him too, but he was hot in the room tonight. He wears long PJ bottoms and a short-sleeved T-shirt, but on these milder nights I think I should put him down with a bare chest, as his hair gets sweaty and he scratches away, trying to settle to the left and to the right... and on it went for what seemed ages to me. It's usually so much faster... and an easy routine for us. </p>
<p>Emails and the end of the laundry... some photo sorting with Doug, and news from Bryn that he won nine straight games in ping pong with Brent tonight! He was a happy man. However, Brent won three games at the end of the evening, so he will be able to sleep tonight as well.  :)</p>
<p>Riku still sleeping soundly... 10:45 and I shall be off to bed soon.</p>
