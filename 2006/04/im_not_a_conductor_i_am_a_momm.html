								<h2>"I'm Not a Conductor, I am a Mommy!"</h2>
								<p>I was awake far too early this morning, but got up, showered and dressed, and managed to annotate the Christmas photo album and get it sent out before Amelia arrived. Feels good to get that job out of the way! Kevin dropped Amelia off at 8:20; she was her perky little self, with no signs of the unhappy little girl her mom had to deal with yesterday. I think the antibiotics kicked in quickly! </p>
<p>Susan wasn't able to book the massage I hoped she could have, but did manage to make an appointment for a facial, her first in years. I was happy to hear she would be relaxing for a while and not rushing around running errands in her bit of time to herself. </p>
<p>Amelia happily came upstairs to get right to work in the little kitchen. She made me "breakfast" and kept herself busy there for a good half hour or more, while I read the paper beside her, and gobbled up the meal she made for me. </p>
<p>Amelia was a busy girl today; she was ready to "wash" the dishes after making breakfast, and there went another half hour with water in both sinks, some bubbles, wooden spoons, and plastic dishes and containers.</p>
<p>With Amelia busy with the dishes, I got the vacuum cleaner going, managing to get this floor vacuumed, along with the stairs going down to the front door and hallway.  </p>
<p>Then it was time to head upstairs for some train time. She was busy with both the train and her new "babies", the two stuffed snowmen. Amelia wanted a blanket for them and collected a little towel from the bathroom which was a good stand-in for one; the babies were treated to many trips around the tracks and once in a while Amelia would take them out and gently tuck them into bed on my bed. Back they would go in the train and this continued on for quite some time. At one point, I commented that she was a very good conductor, and she looked at me carefully, thinking about it, and then said "I'm not a conductor, I am a Mommy!" and a very good one too. </p>
<p>Amelia is so sweet with her babies, and just amazes me with the things she comes out with. She remembers every phrase she ever hears and today I overheard her saying to her baby "Oh my goodness sake..." We also put a diaper on the big doll and she made many comments about what a "sticky BM" that baby had and reminded her/him to "hold your legs up please" as she changed the diaper. Even the tissue wipe went right into the garbage. This is a sweet little girl... her mommy in the making. </p>
<p>Today Akane went to school at 10 A.M. to observe Riku in the classroom, and to go out with some other Moms after for lunch. The children were to be kept until 2 P.M. today, so that the mothers could enjoy a leisurely lunch before getting the children. </p>
<p>However, I asked Akane if she could arrange for me to collect Riku at the usual time. He had such a hard time keeping his eyes open yesterday on the way home, was running a low-grade fever again, and of course still has his cold. This was fine, thank goodness, so after Amelia ate a very good lunch, I headed to her house for her nap at home with Susan, and then went off to pick up Riku. </p>
<p>Riku was not himself when I picked him up; he has been very quiet and hasn't had much energy lately with the cold/fever/cough business. He told me he had cried when his mommy left the school with the other mommies. </p>
<p>Bryn had told me via IM that Riku hadn't eaten much breakfast this morning, and he was quite cranky on the way home in the car. I noticed at home that he hadn't eaten much of his lunch either; most of his rice was still there and his oranges too. Bryn thinks he must have been very hungry to have cried when Akane left and to have been so cranky for me in the car. Makes sense; this is often a clue to his being tired or cranky. </p>
<p>He was funny though; he was going on in the car about how he didn't like anybody and was going to crash the car in the sky, blah, blah... I just turned on the radio and ignored him. When we got home, I opened the back door of the car and said, "Okay, sweetie, let's go upstairs and get you into bed."... and he said "Oh, you not angry any more?" I told him I hadn't been angry, that he had been angry! Funny, eh? </p>
<p>I guess he thought I would be angry with him... but in a way it is funny to hear him go on like this. He tried so hard to engage me in his dialogue of anger. Later on he apologized totally on his own, saying, "I not really angry with you Nana, I was just tired." </p>
<p>He had a good snack before his nap though, and was asleep before I had finished singing "The Wheels on the Bus"! We usually make it through "You're My Honeybunch" and "Rock-a-Bye Baby" a few times, but not today.  He had a good long two-hour nap, with only one awakening at the hour mark; I got the ironing done and some more emailing along with my hot cup of tea.  <br />
 <br />
After Riku's nap today, he had a tub, enjoying just sitting playing quietly with all of his tub toys. He seemed to just relax, and was a much happier boy than he had been. After wrapping him in the big warm towels, which he always loves ("Let's snuggle for a long time!"), and dressing him, I put his snack outside on the little table and we went outside to the garden again for an hour of playtime/cleaning. Riku was busy collecting sticks from the sweepings I was doing, and discovering spit bugs for the first time. He was looking under and around all the bushes exclaiming over each one he found. The world is indeed a wondrous place! </p>
<p>Bryn came by at 6:30 and read Riku a story before heading off to the airport to pick up Doug for me; his flight was in an hour later than scheduled. Riku and I got to stay home which was nice, as I fed him dinner and had the extra time with him. While I was preparing dinner Riku would call out to me about something else he had found in the garden. </p>
<p>After Bryn dropped Doug off, and took Riku off home, Doug and I both did some emailing and then went up to watch the movie I had started watching last night. Doug had seen it before and I still haven't; I fell asleep during bits of it, once again, so just gave up and enjoyed Doug rubbing my back as I drifted off to sleep... </p>
<p>... Virginia wrote to say that Uncle Frank needs to see the doctor on May 11th and will decide then when UF can leave for home; looks like Candy will be coming home during the same time! Yahoo!</p>
