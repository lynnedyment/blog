								<h2>Sunny Saturday</h2>
								<p>What a busy day this turned out to be! The plans originally were for me to accompany Bryn, Mirei, and Riku to the Japanese Tea Garden until 12:30 and to be home for the rest of the day, catching up on all the things I didn't get done during the week, or the week before either! Plans changed, however, and it was a busy day around the house, but not with boring mundane chores. </p>
<p>Bryn picked me up at 9:30, having dropped Akane off at the studio. She has a small scale open house next week and has been working on a new print. Doug was at T'ai Chi, and so off went our little group, meeting up with Kevin and Amelia at the garden. </p>
<p>Well, the children of course loved it from the moment they walked in until we left an hour and a bit later. Amelia was racing down the inclines with no fear at all; Bryn calls her the "energizer bunny" as she runs fast and with such confidence. Kevin said it was the gymnastics training, but it's not; it's just in her genes to be both fearless and capable! </p>
<p>There were stone paths to maneuver, long winding paths through "the woods" to run along, curved bridges to climb, tiny bridges to lean over, lots of bamboo to admire, and the ordinary but somehow fascinating water fountain where we first went in. We took lots of photos of the children, they are such a cute twosome with their blonde and brunette colouring, and took some too of Mirei sleeping in her portable car seat. She got lots of attention too from all the tourists taking a peek at her as she napped. All the koi we had hoped to see had settled in the shade under the bridges, so just before noon hour we left. </p>
<p>In the car, Riku, who was in the back seat beside Mirei, pointed out that she was still sleeping! We knew she would be a hungry girl though, and went to the studio for Akane. However, instead of picking her up as intended, Bryn dropped Mirei off, as Akane was in the middle of a print run. Bryn is working on his UK citizenship application and needed to be fingerprinted, so Riku ended up having his afternoon nap here. He had been awake early and had lots of fresh air, so had a nice nap of one and a half hours. </p>
<p>Bryn came back here, he and Doug put together and played with Bryn's new laptop computer, Riku wakened and did some finger painting, then some painting with brushes, ending with water play in the sink for the longest time while he "cleaned up". </p>
<p>By this time, Bryn had picked up "the girls" and brought them back here. Mirei was in fine smiling form as always, and Akane was hungry. I had some time with her alone while "Dr. Dyment" gave his mother a needle and checked her ears and blood pressure. Then he switched into salon mode and "cut" her hair with his plastic scissors. Doug and Bryn had gone off to test drive the new Honda Fit that Bryn is thinking of buying, and the afternoon and early evening flew by! </p>
<p>They brought burritos back for dinner, and I played upstairs with Mirei and Riku while everyone ate. I wanted a lighter dinner tonight after our burritos last night. </p>
<p>Riku's favourite thing to do right now is "let's snuggle!". He pulls out a blanket from the linen closet, has all lie down, with Mirei in the middle, we cuddle up, and he covers us with the blanket. Then we just beam at each other until Riku is ready to move on to something else. </p>
<p>At 7 p.m., after waving goodbye to them all, I called Uncle Frank in Denver and spoke to him for the first time since his surgery on Thursday. He sounded just great and said he was doing fine now that they had figured out that he needed to eat before taking the pain pills! They had bothered his stomach the day before and so he had decided not to take them at night... a big mistake, since he was in a lot of pain for hours. </p>
<p>I caught up on some emails after finishing "The Da Vinci Code", sitting with my tea in the living room for over an hour... such a treat! I read this book faster than I have any book for the longest time; I really liked it a lot, hated to put it down, and took it with me to read in whatever few minutes I had to spare. Doug will now be able take it to Boston with him tomorrow to read. The movie comes out in mid-May and Kelly insisted we needed to read it first. We listened to her. </p>
<p>Doug and I caught up on a couple of taped shows, I wrote a few more emails -- finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with only about thirty something left to answer! -- and then went off to bed at 12:15.</p>
