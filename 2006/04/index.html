								<h2><a href="/2006/04/no_rain_today.html">No Rain Today!!!</a></h2>
								<p>'Twas a lovely day today, with sunshine by mid-morning and lots of it all afternoon. I started my day off by sleeping in later than usual... 7:45 and then lying in bed reading for another forty-five minutes. Yawn! What a lazy day; it felt like a Sunday. </p>
<p>Bryn came by, accompanied by Riku, with a big hug and an even bigger smile. He was looking very handsome this morning with a sweet light-coloured tailored shirt, a change from his usual pullover cotton tops. The sleeves were rolled back at the cuffs, and the little collar and button-downed front just looked so sweet on him. </p>
<p>Bryn had brought over their laundry, so while he sorted out the first load, Riku sat at the table building a house with the magnetic tiles. He ate some yogurt, drank some vanilla soymilk, and enjoyed his quiet time with me, as I did with him. Riku spotted the flowers from Susan on the kitchen counter, and said "Wow! I like those flowers. I like the big pink ones and the little purple ones too. Do you like them Nana?" I sure do. In less than at hour, at 10:15, they left to go to the movies with Kevin and Amelia. They saw "Ice Age 2" and apparently both children sat very quietly and paid attention to what was going on with the film. Later on Riku told me it was a little bit scary as the ice was cracking and there were dinosaurs and tigers on the ice. They ate popcorn too. I will hear more about it throughout the week, I am sure. </p>
<p>Doug had gone off to his T'ai Chi lesson earlier, so I caught up on some emails, and was chatting on the phone with Tay when Riku and Bryn walked in. Riku was a very tired little boy, in his dad's arms, having just fallen asleep in the car. We read two books, "Alexander" and "Inch by Inch", and then it took six minutes to sing to him and walk out the door, leaving a sleeping boy behind. Today he chose to sleep with his big mouse from Jody, and the black and white big fluffy dog we bought for Mirei. </p>
<p>Riku napped for two hours while Bryn went off for a while, and I continued with the laundry, made a fruit bowl, which I had been intending to do all week, and caught up on more emails. It's a long process as I still have ninety to answer or deal with. </p>
<p>There was a problem with our mail server this morning; it was so odd to have no personal emails in, but to have no junk mail either made me realize there was a problem. After his class, Doug worked with the technicians at the server site and not too much later there was lots of mail... a great photo album from Tracy on their trip to France, news from Gail on their garage sale today, and some news from Glenn and Candy too. Beth must be busy packing up her house for the big move. </p>
<p>Riku ate a little snack before they left for a visit with Alex and his parents... he spotted the mango I was cutting up and ate lots of it, and then ate some scrambled egg, "bacon", and a little toast. They went off at 3:30 or so, Kelly called on Skype, and we had a good long chat, with a couple of interruptions, while Doug went for some groceries, a chore he has taken over much to my delight. Gregg called Kelly for dinner, homemade sushi, made by Gregg of course, and I made a cup of tea and sat and read with my feet up on the chesterfield. Ahh, life is good. I needed this time on my own. </p>
<p>Doug had picked up a good frozen pizza, which went into the oven immediately, while I peeled carrots and celery and cooked up a bowl of spinach with pine nuts to accompany it. We sat eating and watching three taped TV shows, enjoying every moment of it. I even got a good back rub during the last show. A little more computer time, and back up to watch one last show...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/04/i_will_protect_you_and_rescue.html">"I Will Protect You and Rescue You"</a></h2>
								<p>Lazy morning again, with a little reading time in bed before I got up. Typical morning for the first bit of it... emails, shower, breakfast, read the paper, and started the laundry. </p>
<p>By 9:30 I was anxious to know whether Uncle Frank had passed his driving test, so I called him. He was home; Glenn had taken him for it, in case he failed and had to be driven home, but he passed with flying colours! I am so pleased but not nearly as pleased as he was; he had taken two lessons and felt they really paid off in terms of his confidence and new found skills. Yahoo! We had a very long chat about his upcoming trip to Denver, and then mine not too long following that, the latest children stories, and various other interesting things. Time flies when we're chatting away, as always. </p>
<p>Doug came with me to pick up Riku; he came bounding out, first one up the stairs and greeted me with that big smile. I got a hug around the neck and we stayed so I could see Sophie, a little girl he has talked about with Akane. I commented to him that she has long hair and he said "yes, just like in 'Howl's Moving Castle'". Turns out there is a character in the movie called Sophie; this has me confused for a couple of days until Bryn filled me in on this. </p>
<p>Today on the way home we noticed barbed wire, and razor wire... Grandpa told us this... and of course Amelia's playground, the massive blue crane near his school, and various billboards along the highway. Grandpa had to stop quickly at one point, which made Riku laugh out loud so hard, that Grandpa did it a few more times just so we could hear that laugh. He drank a whole container of vanilla soy in about three minutes on the way home, and ate 3/4 of a banana. Good food for sleeping! </p>
<p>One of the things Riku is learning is everyone's full names. He now knows that he is John Riku Dyment (he has known this for some time), and also knows that his daddy is John Bryn Dyment, that Grandpa is John Douglas Dyment and that I am Lynne Dyment. He knows his name in Japan is Riku Goda. It's such fun seeing these little ones ingesting all this information and storing it away. </p>
<p>He asked for "just five minutes" to play with Grandpa when we got home. I gave him seven, so that they had time to get upstairs and start building a "huge tower" that was on the agenda. We also had two stories today and then he was ready to settle down. Easy as can be, he was asleep within seven minutes and slept for an hour and a half. I like these 3:30 awakenings, as they make for an easier and earlier bedtime. </p>
<p>Bryn and I were IM-ing for a bit while Riku slept, and I saved a portion of the conversation to remember... here it is:</p>
<p>bryn says: Riku gave a loving goodbye to Mirei in the kitchen this morning<br />
Lynne says: awww... what an amazing little brother he is<br />
bryn says: then, when we were in the outside hallway, he climbed back up a few stairs because he wanted to say goodbye again<br />
bryn says: while he was doing it, akane and i were looking at each other in amazement<br />
Lynne says: he loves her and she loves him... they've bonded<br />
bryn says: i think it's the cheeks<br />
Lynne says: i think it's the smiles</p>
<p>Gail called and we had some time, but not quite enough, for a little chat before Riku wanted me off the phone. He gets a little bossy and tells me to "say goodbye now"; he did this last week too. However, he did say goodbye to her too and said "I love you", which I notice he does when he is on his toy cell phone too. This is a Dyment and Rodgers family tradition and it looks like it will be passed on through this branch of the family too. </p>
<p>Riku played upstairs for a bit, but then asked me to carry the tower downstairs. He asked me to put on his "soft" pants today, and not the jeans he had been wearing. I keep a couple of pairs of soft, thick cotton pull-on "joggers" for him here, and he likes them, just as his cousins in Toronto do. </p>
<p>Riku was playing with play-doh, making me "dinner" when I served him his... mac' and cheese, which is now how he refers to it as well. I had added carrots, celery, mushrooms, spinach, and lots of tomatoes to it, and he ate a huge bowl, much more than I expected. He had had a full container of yogurt earlier, so I was surprised at his appetite. However, the stronger antibiotic seems to be doing the trick with his cough; I didn't hear it once today, and noticed his sinuses are clear too; he is breathing more easily than I have heard him in months. For dessert he had some Devon cream pudding with strawberries, with a plate of strawberries and grapes after his bath. </p>
<p>I wrote out a few cards and notes this afternoon, and Riku asked what I was doing. When I told him he said he would write a letter to Auntie Kelly; I gave him a notecard and he "wrote" a letter on one side and drew her a picture on the other. He told me the letter said "Dear Auntie Kelly. I like you sooooo much!" He also drew her a big X and O on it too, when I told him they meant a hug and a kiss. I dashed off to mail it at the hospital along with my mail. </p>
<p>Oh, when he was ready for his bath, he ran around being a "run around naked boy" like Brynnie used to be! He doesn't usually do this, but tonight he even got hold of the broom and started sweeping the floor for me. I took some great shots but Doug had the card out of the camera and I missed them all. No, I didn't see that it was telling me there was no card! Darn! </p>
<p>By 7:10 he was all ready for bed, sitting at the table doing a numbers puzzle and a Ravensburger farm puzzle; he is so much better than I am at them! His daddy came in for a quick goodnight hug and kiss, and we admired the pink streaky sky while waving goodbye to him. </p>
<p>Tuck in time was at 7:40, and we read two stories: "Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!", which makes him smile at each page, after reading an old familiar favourite, "Franklin and His Special Blanket". It has been months since we read it; it's a tiny pop-up book and I think he was happy to see it and hear it again. </p>
<p>He took longer to settle than I expected him too, but he was hot in the room tonight. He wears long PJ bottoms and a short-sleeved T-shirt, but on these milder nights I think I should put him down with a bare chest, as his hair gets sweaty and he scratches away, trying to settle to the left and to the right... and on it went for what seemed ages to me. It's usually so much faster... and an easy routine for us. </p>
<p>Emails and the end of the laundry... some photo sorting with Doug, and news from Bryn that he won nine straight games in ping pong with Brent tonight! He was a happy man. However, Brent won three games at the end of the evening, so he will be able to sleep tonight as well.  :)</p>
<p>Riku still sleeping soundly... 10:45 and I shall be off to bed soon.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/04/observations.html">Observations...</a></h2>
								<p>I slept until 7:45 today; very unusual for me. I really need the extra hour or so during these busy days, but I guess I need the sleep too! Somehow it flew by, as always, with emails and lots of photo work, then a late breakfast and a phone call from Tay. </p>
<p>Doug and I dashed off to pick Riku up at 12:40 and were parked in front of his school at 12:51! If the highway is clear we can make it clear across town so quickly; going through the streets the back way would make the trip twice as long. I sat and read a magazine while Doug went off to buy us some hot vegetable rolls, and a couple of custard buns for him. </p>
<p>Riku doesn't seem nearly as sleepy as he used to at pick-up. It may just be that I am in the back seat with him, when Doug is around, but I'm not working to keep him awake either, as I was even a month ago. He is so interested in telling us about things we pass, or asking questions about them. Today, when Doug went to make a U-turn at the school, Riku pointed up the hill to tell us that his daddy goes that way. As we were driving along the main road to the freeway, Riku told us "streets have names you know, but not houses." Bryn had told me how he has been pointing out street signs to Riku, and it has obviously stuck. He asked what street we were on, and after several blocks when I told him it was still the same one he commented "Oak Street is very long!" Doug stopped the car around the corner from us to point out the barbed wire, and to let Riku have a closer look at it. Riku said "it is sharp, just like cactus". He was snuggling his mouse all the way home, and offering it sips of his vanilla soy milk and sliced bananas. </p>
<p>He asked for ten minutes to play and I went up with him to build a tower which was taller than he was! We left it for after his nap, and he was asleep by 2 p.m. He napped for two hours, waking twice in between, but was pretty grumbly at the end of it. I didn't encourage him staying in bed, but we snuggled for a long as he wakened slowly. </p>
<p>The rain had stopped late this morning and I wanted to get him to the playground for some fresh air and time with some children. This might have been our first day in months with no Play-Doh or clay play, no kitchen or water time either! Riku was content to play upstairs with the blocks with me, while he snacked on more milk and fruit, plus a few bites of tapioca pudding. </p>
<p>We drove to the playground for the extra time that gave us; Riku had told me we could take the stroller as his legs were too tired to walk!  The sun was shining, and the park was full of children when we arrived at 5:20. Riku sat in the sandbox immediately and soon a little girl, with red curly hair sat down beside him. Her name was Ava, and the two of them sat together uncovering a long white plastic piece under the sand; they pretended it was a long whale and spent their time covering it up and uncovering it, taking great delight in all of it! Another little boy joined us, and they shared Riku's sand toys until we had to leave at 6 p.m. for home. Riku said later in his tub "Ava was a nice girl" and she was indeed. </p>
<p>I dropped him off at home for dinner and a little time with his mom and sister; Bryn had asked if I would have him overnight as he was planning to work with Kevin on a special project. At 7:20 my doorbell rang and there was a little boy standing there on the doorstep peering through the glass. He was awfully cute standing there, anticipating my answering the door, although had to rush right upstairs as "urine coming!" </p>
<p>I had his bath all ready and as usual he joked about putting all the toys in the tub. Tonight he was the one that said "There is no room for me in there!", as I tell him each time he pulls them all out of the chest and dumps them in... three boats, 26 alphabet letters, all his tub toys from when he was just a little guy, and lots and lots of extras we have acquired since then. </p>
<p>Doug read him two books tonight, including "Where the Wild Things Are" and for the first time Doug read "Leonardo, the Terrible Monster"; they both enjoyed them! </p>
<p>Riku took a long time to settle down tonight, which really surprised me. He was just sleeping very lightly, but I knew if I left the room he would be up and calling for me. I haven't heard a peep since I left him though, and it's now 11 p.m. Usually, he wakens once at the forty minute mark or on the hour, so I guess he just needed the time to go into a deeper sleep tonight. </p>
<p>I don't know if I have written this before, but we have a new addition to our sleeping ritual... we always have a story or two, then I sing three songs to both him and Amelia, and they are always the same ones... "The Wheels on the Bus", "You're my Honeybunch" and "Rock-a-Bye Baby". Usually by the time I am on number three they are asleep, especially at nap time. However, I decided the other day to have them take three deep breaths, in and out, then we have a big yawn, and finish off with a big stretch and a "relax" down. It seems to help them settle down ready for sleep, and it worked for me a couple of times too. I don't sleep with the children during their naps, and don't want to either; I need the time when they are sleeping, I'm not a good napper and end up with a headache or feeling grouchy (it's seven plus hours or nothing for me!), and I don't want them to depend on me to get to sleep or stay asleep either. </p>
<p>... and off to bed I go... very soon.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/04/dreams.html">Dreams...</a></h2>
								<p>Riku had a restless night last night; I guess he is getting a cold, as he was quite stuffy while trying to get to sleep, and then today had a runny nose and a couple of sneezes. Darn! Just when he was finally feeling better and getting over the coughing/fever business that he has struggled with. However, unless he is wrapped in cotton wool and kept in the house with no one else around, he is going to be exposed to cold germs. </p>
<p>I told Riku he had a few dreams last night; I remember him waking to tell me he wanted gingerbread men. He was very interested to hear about it and then asked me if I "bemembered" my dream about losing my purse and going on a plane. The subject came up again later as we watched a Pingu episode, where Pingu dreams about a big mean looking walrus. Wee Bryn was always afraid of that particular segment and would leave the room about one minute before the walrus appeared; Riku had the same reaction to it, and has been telling me he doesn't want to see the walrus. However, this morning he said he would like to, knowing it was about a dream, so I held him on my lap and we talked about it. </p>
<p>He had a wonderful time building houses with the plastic magnet tiles of Amelia's. I think we will get an extra set in soon, as he made some really wonderful structures with them, and sat for the longest time on his own working away at pointed roofs and overhangs "case it rains". </p>
<p>Riku's appetite is back in full swing so I hope to see his weight rise back to 32 pounds; he was down to just 30 the last visit to the doctor. He ate banana slices, strawberries, and vanilla soy before his breakfast a bit later of hot cereal with blueberries. For lunch he ate an omelette with spinach and mushrooms with fresh tomato on the side,  a full slice of toast, and then asked for two pieces of "bacon". He is enjoying the dark brown organic apple juice Doug picked up for him last week. He had a full container of yogurt with flax seed stirred in, for his snack, and half of his chocolate egg from school on Friday. Dinner was a veggie and noodle soup... celery, carrots, spinach, and tofu with whole grain noodles, and a whole small apple for dessert, cut into slim pieces. </p>
<p>Okay, our day in a large nutshell... off to the new-to-us playground at Clipper and Douglass Streets. It is great! Lots of donated large plastic toys... kitchen, little house, stoves, pans, etc., plus the usual climbing structure, but this one has a great chain link ladder, which Riku really liked. It leans slightly inwards, so is much easier for the younger children to climb. There were two birthday parties being held in the large area at the back and Riku had lots of fun joining in chasing bubbles, and then climbing up along the path into the wooded area. He had lots of time in the sandbox, and during the hour and half we were there had lots of companions sharing the toys and building alongside of him. </p>
<p>Home for lunch and then nap time; a perfect hour and a half ending at 3:15. We took turns pretending we were ghosts after his nap, covering our heads with his small cotton blanket and waving our arms about. He loved it and was laughing so hard; I stopped it sooner than he would have liked as I could just imagine his bumping into door knobs and corners, but it was fun while it lasted. </p>
<p>The afternoon passed quickly, as he spent some time drawing in his "studio", "rescuing" me from bad guys, with a "weapon" built from two long Lego pieces, attached to three smaller ones across the top. Looks like a gun to me, but he mostly calls it a weapon and is happy to "save" me from monsters. The "monster spray" we have been using up 'til now seems to have passed its power to this new weapon, but the "spray" (just a finger up in the air pushing a pretend button) has fallen out of favour for sure. </p>
<p>Akane walked over with Mirei about 4 P.M. and visited with us until 7:30 or so. Mirei was her usual smiling self, making lots of sounds back to me when I talked to her, admiring the big chicken in the kitchen, spending a little time lying on the bed looking at the bird and train mobiles, as well as some brightly-coloured stuffed animals, and enjoying the attention her big brother gives her. She really beams at him, and with good reason; he is very attentive to her and gets in close to her for lots of cuddles and chats. </p>
<p>In the living room, Akane put the train together that Riku's Grandpa in Japan gave to him for Christmas; Bryn and Akane just found the battery charger a few days ago. It may have to go up to our bedroom, as the living room is small already and now there is no easy access to the sofa or one of the chairs! </p>
<p>I made a couple of banana loaves, fixed Riku's soup, made up some tomato sauce and pasta, and a side dish of spinach for Akane and me, and spent as much time with Mirei as I could. She got fussy at dinner time, as babies often do, so I held her on my lap while Akane ate, and ate with one hand until Akane was ready to nurse her. I'm sure she was sound asleep before Akane arrived home. </p>
<p>Riku wanted an ABC book for his main book tonight; he has been enjoying the ABC placemat the last couple of days and repeating which words start with particular letters. He was painting with brushes when Akane walked in, and finished up a lovely painting, brushing some colour over the previous ones and coming up with a new look for him. He is very serious about how many drops of paint he wants and where he wants them. It's fun to watch him carefully making these decisions. </p>
<p>Bryn was working hard in San Diego, while his friends were out hiking. We just IM'd very briefly, as I was busy with Riku. He returns home tomorrow night. Doug Skyped from Boston, after enjoying a day there on his own. He starts work in the morning. </p>
<p>I had lots of "I love you soooo much" today; such a sweet thing to here from this little boy. </p>
<p>Also, at one point when Riku was saying "I not like anybody", I repeated it back to him; he looked at me quite surprised and said "you really angry, Nana?". I said I wasn't and he said "Oh, you just pretending. Me too. Let's not be really angry; we just pretend." Fine with me. He is such a happy little boy, and very patient, building his house over and over when it collapsed on him today, and yet occasionally this angst overcomes him, and I think he really is trying to gauge our reaction to it. </p>
<p>Off I go... kitchen cleaned up, Riku's "studio" tidied up after lots of artistic paper-tearing projects this evening, and gluing too! He had little squares which he likes to colour with his markers, and was delighted when I gave him the glue stick so that he could stick them all on a big piece of paper. So easy to make him happy... </p>
<p>Night night... almost 11 P.M.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/04/tomorrows_the_weekend_and_happ.html">Tomorrow's the Weekend! ... and Happy Birthday to Sheldon</a></h2>
								<p>Doug and I both slept until 8:20 this morning; it has been a long time since this has happened. I was reading until 12:45 A.M., but that was still a long sleep! </p>
<p>Spent the morning at home, finishing up cards and puttering about. Tammy e-mailed photos of how the office staff decorated for Sheldon's 63rd birthday, with lots of balloons, pink flamingoes on the front lawn, and a banner suggesting folks honk in his honour! Lots of fun for him and he was beaming away in the photos. </p>
<p>Leaving at 12:40 to pick up Riku arrived very quickly somehow. Riku came up the stairs smiling but looking tired; Bryn said he was awake at 6:10 this morning, slept on Bryn's neck for another half hour, a funny little habit Riku has. He just likes skin contact, I think. </p>
<p>He had a lovely start to his morning, with a visit with his dad to Amelia's house for a little breakfast and some playtime in the park across the street before heading for school. </p>
<p>I took along three new books to read to him in the car. He liked them all, and after I read each one to him, he spent lots of time just looking them over on his own. By the time we got home he had memorized half the pages in one of them; it's a simple board book he should have had long ago "Brown Bear, Brown Bear", but both Bryn and Caillie liked it a lot and I hated to have him not know it. </p>
<p>He had a whole banana and soy milk in the car and was more than ready to be tucked in when we got home; he asked to go to bed now! He is sleeping with no sounds of congestion and no coughing, good signs as he has been fighting them both again this week. </p>
<p>I called Candy and we chatted for a half hour; she and Rick were on their way out with Brian for dinner, but it was good to catch up with her. </p>
<p>Riku napped for two and a half hours this afternoon and wasn't quite ready to awaken even then. I opened his door but didn't snuggle in with him as I knew he would have dropped right off again. He ate a bowl of hot cereal, sat on my lap, and was just not quite himself. Doug and I were going off to a book reading, so I walked Riku home for some fresh air and a little exercise. He happily carried his pinwheel for a bit, watching it spin, but was tired enough that he tried hard to talk me into carrying him most of the way. I gave in on the last block and it helped that Lily was at the dry cleaners, so that we could wave to her. </p>
<p>Mirei was looking very pink and happy, sitting on the counter with a bright pink hat and outfit on. We exchanged big smiles and down I went to meet Doug, who had driven over to get me. </p>
<p>We drove to "A Clean Well-Lighted Place for Books" to see and hear Paul Rusesabagina, the now famous hotel manager depicted in the film <em>Hotel Rwanda.</em> He saved 1200 people from certain death by giving them refuge in the hotel; he and his family were threatened and given a chance to escape but he stayed behind, and luckily survived the horror that took place there. He was a very inspirational and interesting speaker, speaking from his heart and with very strong opinions about the U.N. forces who left them without any means of protecting themselves. </p>
<p>Out for a delicious bean burrito on Mission Street; I intended eating only half but was hungrier than I thought, and ate the whole thing. Home at 9 P.M.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/04/sunny_saturday.html">Sunny Saturday</a></h2>
								<p>What a busy day this turned out to be! The plans originally were for me to accompany Bryn, Mirei, and Riku to the Japanese Tea Garden until 12:30 and to be home for the rest of the day, catching up on all the things I didn't get done during the week, or the week before either! Plans changed, however, and it was a busy day around the house, but not with boring mundane chores. </p>
<p>Bryn picked me up at 9:30, having dropped Akane off at the studio. She has a small scale open house next week and has been working on a new print. Doug was at T'ai Chi, and so off went our little group, meeting up with Kevin and Amelia at the garden. </p>
<p>Well, the children of course loved it from the moment they walked in until we left an hour and a bit later. Amelia was racing down the inclines with no fear at all; Bryn calls her the "energizer bunny" as she runs fast and with such confidence. Kevin said it was the gymnastics training, but it's not; it's just in her genes to be both fearless and capable! </p>
<p>There were stone paths to maneuver, long winding paths through "the woods" to run along, curved bridges to climb, tiny bridges to lean over, lots of bamboo to admire, and the ordinary but somehow fascinating water fountain where we first went in. We took lots of photos of the children, they are such a cute twosome with their blonde and brunette colouring, and took some too of Mirei sleeping in her portable car seat. She got lots of attention too from all the tourists taking a peek at her as she napped. All the koi we had hoped to see had settled in the shade under the bridges, so just before noon hour we left. </p>
<p>In the car, Riku, who was in the back seat beside Mirei, pointed out that she was still sleeping! We knew she would be a hungry girl though, and went to the studio for Akane. However, instead of picking her up as intended, Bryn dropped Mirei off, as Akane was in the middle of a print run. Bryn is working on his UK citizenship application and needed to be fingerprinted, so Riku ended up having his afternoon nap here. He had been awake early and had lots of fresh air, so had a nice nap of one and a half hours. </p>
<p>Bryn came back here, he and Doug put together and played with Bryn's new laptop computer, Riku wakened and did some finger painting, then some painting with brushes, ending with water play in the sink for the longest time while he "cleaned up". </p>
<p>By this time, Bryn had picked up "the girls" and brought them back here. Mirei was in fine smiling form as always, and Akane was hungry. I had some time with her alone while "Dr. Dyment" gave his mother a needle and checked her ears and blood pressure. Then he switched into salon mode and "cut" her hair with his plastic scissors. Doug and Bryn had gone off to test drive the new Honda Fit that Bryn is thinking of buying, and the afternoon and early evening flew by! </p>
<p>They brought burritos back for dinner, and I played upstairs with Mirei and Riku while everyone ate. I wanted a lighter dinner tonight after our burritos last night. </p>
<p>Riku's favourite thing to do right now is "let's snuggle!". He pulls out a blanket from the linen closet, has all lie down, with Mirei in the middle, we cuddle up, and he covers us with the blanket. Then we just beam at each other until Riku is ready to move on to something else. </p>
<p>At 7 p.m., after waving goodbye to them all, I called Uncle Frank in Denver and spoke to him for the first time since his surgery on Thursday. He sounded just great and said he was doing fine now that they had figured out that he needed to eat before taking the pain pills! They had bothered his stomach the day before and so he had decided not to take them at night... a big mistake, since he was in a lot of pain for hours. </p>
<p>I caught up on some emails after finishing "The Da Vinci Code", sitting with my tea in the living room for over an hour... such a treat! I read this book faster than I have any book for the longest time; I really liked it a lot, hated to put it down, and took it with me to read in whatever few minutes I had to spare. Doug will now be able take it to Boston with him tomorrow to read. The movie comes out in mid-May and Kelly insisted we needed to read it first. We listened to her. </p>
<p>Doug and I caught up on a couple of taped shows, I wrote a few more emails -- finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with only about thirty something left to answer! -- and then went off to bed at 12:15.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/04/wednesday_with_riku_1.html">Wednesday with Riku</a></h2>
								<p>Foggy day today. Bryn and Riku have a new Wednesday morning routine; before heading off to school and work, they stop in for an early morning visit with Amelia. It's on the way to school, so very handy, and the children have a little time in the house together and then head out to the playground across the street for a little exercise. </p>
<p>I puttered away in the morning doing various clean up jobs, mostly paper work and phone calls, and also wrote up lots of birthday/anniversary cards ready to mail when I'm away. </p>
<p>Left the house at 12:40 for pick-up; Riku was coughing and still has his cold today, so had a hard time staying awake in the car this afternoon. Back at home he slept for less than an hour since he was coughing so badly; he woke feeling very hot. Poor wee guy; he is obviously tired, but despite the elevated position I had him in (with a pillow under the mattress) he just coughed himself awake each time.</p>
<p> So, he stayed awake and sat in bed for the longest time, after dragging a few books from the front bedroom to his room. He sat "reading to himself" and told me that "the icky monster book is my favourite book". Bryn had sent this book over from their house since they don't care for it, but right now Riku does. </p>
<p>Bryn IM'd me to tell me a funny Amelia story today... Susan was looking for Amelia when they first showed up, and overlooked her in her bedroom. Standing right at the doorway of the room, she was calling out for her in a loud voice when Amelia piped up in a very quiet little voice, "I am right here Mommy." </p>
<p>After going through his huge stack of books, Riku spent some time at his little table, colouring his few special rocks! with washable pens; this was a first. He was very meticulous about it, and worked away at this project for a good half hour. </p>
<p>Then we went out to the garden for some sweeping and weeding (and fresh air; not enough energy for the playground today) ending up there for an hour and a half. I was a mess at the end of it, as the pollen was heavy and I was sneezing and sniffing terribly when we came in. The yard looks great though! <br />
 <br />
While having his snack, Riku was chatting away to himself and I managed to jot some of it down... "I'm using all the pens. I need many things; I have to use them every time." and "I'm a big boy now and I am vewy vewy strong!" </p>
<p>He spent the last forty-five minutes of his time here working on lots of puzzles on his bed, going through about seven of them. Today he did the alphabet puzzles for the first time in a long time. We went outside to the front of the house with chalk while waiting for Bryn to come for him at 6:30; it was good timing as we got to talk to the man out walking his little dog. The timing was perfect. </p>
<p>Had some news from Virginia today about Uncle Frank's follow-up visit to his surgeon. UF is healing very well, and the doctor is very pleased with the results of the surgery. UF is already walking tall although is still in some pain. </p>
<p>My evening flew by as usual; I chatted with Doug on Skype after having some problems with it, and answered a few emails.. and my evening disappeared too quickly.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/04/no_amelia.html">No Amelia...</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn dropped in very early this morning unannounced; I was up and busy at the computer at 7:30 having already showered and made my bed. He was here to frame a couple of Akane's etchings before driving Riku to school. He thought it best not to bring Riku over, even though he wanted so much to "help". </p>
<p>Susan was quite sure yesterday that Amelia had an earache; she has been having a terrible time sleeping, which is often worse when Amelia is coming down with something, and so decided to take Amelia to the doctor this morning, rather than send her to school. She called me to confirm that Amelia does indeed have an ear infection and is now on antibiotics. Susan felt it best to nap with her today instead of bringing her here to me; they both need the sleep and Amelia tends to sleep longer when she is in bed with her mom for her naps. </p>
<p>Since Riku is still sick with his cold and cough, and Akane was at the studio this morning, I decided to pick Riku up from school and have him nap here. He sleeps longer and Akane can continue working at the studio. It's open house this weekend and she has been there a lot lately. </p>
<p>Riku woke up with bright red cheeks and is still coughing; poor wee guy, it will be good to see an end to this, if we ever do! It has all been going on for so long now. He sat on his bed for the longest time playing with all of his cars and wanting me to play with him in there. He had no interest at all in going outside today, even though I tried to coax him into getting a little bit of fresh air. We played with many of his animals too, and they were all involved with the cars and accidents and rescues too! </p>
<p>Bryn called to see if I wanted to go to the studio with them. Akane needs to be there to help with getting the studio ready for tomorrow night; I was ready to beg off, since I really want to get busy with some photo annotation tonight, and was tired, but Bryn thought it would be good for me to get out and for Riku to hang around the studio too. So, Riku and I met them at the studio at 6:15. Bryn was busy hanging Akane's art pieces and so Riku and I took a stroll around looking at all the other art. We told each other which we liked and which we didn't, with Riku asking occasionally, "What this one about, Nana?", and often we just had to take turns guessing. </p>
<p>Mirei and I had a stroll around too while Riku really did help his Dad hang some art. Bryn taught him how to carefully use the wire cutters and had him snip off the pieces he needed, after which Riku made a nice neat little pile of various sizes. I was very impressed with how careful he really was being, as the edges were very sharp and could have hurt him. He took the job very seriously and did well. </p>
<p>Mirei was sitting in her little soft seat looking very comfortable and as happy and chunky as ever. The smiles from that girl; they are just the sweetest smiles in the world, since she smiles and her entire face just lights up! I picked her up and walked her around the studio, happily showing her off to all the women who smiled at her and commented on those cheeks of hers! </p>
<p>There was free pizza for dinner, so there went my plans for a salad for me tonight; it was delicious, with a nice tasty sauce, from Pizza Man in Noe Valley, Bryn thought. </p>
<p>I went home with them at 7:20 and almost immediately started the process of tucking Riku into bed; he needed a snack first though, and had a quick tub, so it was close to 8:45 before I finished his stories.  He took longer to fall asleep than usual, but I think his breathing once again made it hard for him to relax. It was close to 9:30, before I felt I could leave the room. </p>
<p>Bryn had talked me into staying and watching a rented DVD of ours with them, but it was a mistake since I was quite sure I would fall asleep. Once they turned the lights off in the living room for Mirei, who had been awake at that point for thirteen hours except for a twenty minute cat nap(!), I fell asleep too. </p>
<p>I drove home, a very tired gal, at close to 11 P.M. I washed and undressed for bed, and sat watching an Oprah tape, but started drifting off half way through it. I'm going to have Amelia with me tomorrow morning to make up for not seeing her today, so there will be no sleeping in for me in the morning... bed at 11:30 P.M. </p>
<p>Beth's last night with email connection for a while; they move tomorrow!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/04/im_not_a_conductor_i_am_a_momm.html">"I'm Not a Conductor, I am a Mommy!"</a></h2>
								<p>I was awake far too early this morning, but got up, showered and dressed, and managed to annotate the Christmas photo album and get it sent out before Amelia arrived. Feels good to get that job out of the way! Kevin dropped Amelia off at 8:20; she was her perky little self, with no signs of the unhappy little girl her mom had to deal with yesterday. I think the antibiotics kicked in quickly! </p>
<p>Susan wasn't able to book the massage I hoped she could have, but did manage to make an appointment for a facial, her first in years. I was happy to hear she would be relaxing for a while and not rushing around running errands in her bit of time to herself. </p>
<p>Amelia happily came upstairs to get right to work in the little kitchen. She made me "breakfast" and kept herself busy there for a good half hour or more, while I read the paper beside her, and gobbled up the meal she made for me. </p>
<p>Amelia was a busy girl today; she was ready to "wash" the dishes after making breakfast, and there went another half hour with water in both sinks, some bubbles, wooden spoons, and plastic dishes and containers.</p>
<p>With Amelia busy with the dishes, I got the vacuum cleaner going, managing to get this floor vacuumed, along with the stairs going down to the front door and hallway.  </p>
<p>Then it was time to head upstairs for some train time. She was busy with both the train and her new "babies", the two stuffed snowmen. Amelia wanted a blanket for them and collected a little towel from the bathroom which was a good stand-in for one; the babies were treated to many trips around the tracks and once in a while Amelia would take them out and gently tuck them into bed on my bed. Back they would go in the train and this continued on for quite some time. At one point, I commented that she was a very good conductor, and she looked at me carefully, thinking about it, and then said "I'm not a conductor, I am a Mommy!" and a very good one too. </p>
<p>Amelia is so sweet with her babies, and just amazes me with the things she comes out with. She remembers every phrase she ever hears and today I overheard her saying to her baby "Oh my goodness sake..." We also put a diaper on the big doll and she made many comments about what a "sticky BM" that baby had and reminded her/him to "hold your legs up please" as she changed the diaper. Even the tissue wipe went right into the garbage. This is a sweet little girl... her mommy in the making. </p>
<p>Today Akane went to school at 10 A.M. to observe Riku in the classroom, and to go out with some other Moms after for lunch. The children were to be kept until 2 P.M. today, so that the mothers could enjoy a leisurely lunch before getting the children. </p>
<p>However, I asked Akane if she could arrange for me to collect Riku at the usual time. He had such a hard time keeping his eyes open yesterday on the way home, was running a low-grade fever again, and of course still has his cold. This was fine, thank goodness, so after Amelia ate a very good lunch, I headed to her house for her nap at home with Susan, and then went off to pick up Riku. </p>
<p>Riku was not himself when I picked him up; he has been very quiet and hasn't had much energy lately with the cold/fever/cough business. He told me he had cried when his mommy left the school with the other mommies. </p>
<p>Bryn had told me via IM that Riku hadn't eaten much breakfast this morning, and he was quite cranky on the way home in the car. I noticed at home that he hadn't eaten much of his lunch either; most of his rice was still there and his oranges too. Bryn thinks he must have been very hungry to have cried when Akane left and to have been so cranky for me in the car. Makes sense; this is often a clue to his being tired or cranky. </p>
<p>He was funny though; he was going on in the car about how he didn't like anybody and was going to crash the car in the sky, blah, blah... I just turned on the radio and ignored him. When we got home, I opened the back door of the car and said, "Okay, sweetie, let's go upstairs and get you into bed."... and he said "Oh, you not angry any more?" I told him I hadn't been angry, that he had been angry! Funny, eh? </p>
<p>I guess he thought I would be angry with him... but in a way it is funny to hear him go on like this. He tried so hard to engage me in his dialogue of anger. Later on he apologized totally on his own, saying, "I not really angry with you Nana, I was just tired." </p>
<p>He had a good snack before his nap though, and was asleep before I had finished singing "The Wheels on the Bus"! We usually make it through "You're My Honeybunch" and "Rock-a-Bye Baby" a few times, but not today.  He had a good long two-hour nap, with only one awakening at the hour mark; I got the ironing done and some more emailing along with my hot cup of tea.  <br />
 <br />
After Riku's nap today, he had a tub, enjoying just sitting playing quietly with all of his tub toys. He seemed to just relax, and was a much happier boy than he had been. After wrapping him in the big warm towels, which he always loves ("Let's snuggle for a long time!"), and dressing him, I put his snack outside on the little table and we went outside to the garden again for an hour of playtime/cleaning. Riku was busy collecting sticks from the sweepings I was doing, and discovering spit bugs for the first time. He was looking under and around all the bushes exclaiming over each one he found. The world is indeed a wondrous place! </p>
<p>Bryn came by at 6:30 and read Riku a story before heading off to the airport to pick up Doug for me; his flight was in an hour later than scheduled. Riku and I got to stay home which was nice, as I fed him dinner and had the extra time with him. While I was preparing dinner Riku would call out to me about something else he had found in the garden. </p>
<p>After Bryn dropped Doug off, and took Riku off home, Doug and I both did some emailing and then went up to watch the movie I had started watching last night. Doug had seen it before and I still haven't; I fell asleep during bits of it, once again, so just gave up and enjoyed Doug rubbing my back as I drifted off to sleep... </p>
<p>... Virginia wrote to say that Uncle Frank needs to see the doctor on May 11th and will decide then when UF can leave for home; looks like Candy will be coming home during the same time! Yahoo!</p>
