								<h2>Observations...</h2>
								<p>I slept until 7:45 today; very unusual for me. I really need the extra hour or so during these busy days, but I guess I need the sleep too! Somehow it flew by, as always, with emails and lots of photo work, then a late breakfast and a phone call from Tay. </p>
<p>Doug and I dashed off to pick Riku up at 12:40 and were parked in front of his school at 12:51! If the highway is clear we can make it clear across town so quickly; going through the streets the back way would make the trip twice as long. I sat and read a magazine while Doug went off to buy us some hot vegetable rolls, and a couple of custard buns for him. </p>
<p>Riku doesn't seem nearly as sleepy as he used to at pick-up. It may just be that I am in the back seat with him, when Doug is around, but I'm not working to keep him awake either, as I was even a month ago. He is so interested in telling us about things we pass, or asking questions about them. Today, when Doug went to make a U-turn at the school, Riku pointed up the hill to tell us that his daddy goes that way. As we were driving along the main road to the freeway, Riku told us "streets have names you know, but not houses." Bryn had told me how he has been pointing out street signs to Riku, and it has obviously stuck. He asked what street we were on, and after several blocks when I told him it was still the same one he commented "Oak Street is very long!" Doug stopped the car around the corner from us to point out the barbed wire, and to let Riku have a closer look at it. Riku said "it is sharp, just like cactus". He was snuggling his mouse all the way home, and offering it sips of his vanilla soy milk and sliced bananas. </p>
<p>He asked for ten minutes to play and I went up with him to build a tower which was taller than he was! We left it for after his nap, and he was asleep by 2 p.m. He napped for two hours, waking twice in between, but was pretty grumbly at the end of it. I didn't encourage him staying in bed, but we snuggled for a long as he wakened slowly. </p>
<p>The rain had stopped late this morning and I wanted to get him to the playground for some fresh air and time with some children. This might have been our first day in months with no Play-Doh or clay play, no kitchen or water time either! Riku was content to play upstairs with the blocks with me, while he snacked on more milk and fruit, plus a few bites of tapioca pudding. </p>
<p>We drove to the playground for the extra time that gave us; Riku had told me we could take the stroller as his legs were too tired to walk!  The sun was shining, and the park was full of children when we arrived at 5:20. Riku sat in the sandbox immediately and soon a little girl, with red curly hair sat down beside him. Her name was Ava, and the two of them sat together uncovering a long white plastic piece under the sand; they pretended it was a long whale and spent their time covering it up and uncovering it, taking great delight in all of it! Another little boy joined us, and they shared Riku's sand toys until we had to leave at 6 p.m. for home. Riku said later in his tub "Ava was a nice girl" and she was indeed. </p>
<p>I dropped him off at home for dinner and a little time with his mom and sister; Bryn had asked if I would have him overnight as he was planning to work with Kevin on a special project. At 7:20 my doorbell rang and there was a little boy standing there on the doorstep peering through the glass. He was awfully cute standing there, anticipating my answering the door, although had to rush right upstairs as "urine coming!" </p>
<p>I had his bath all ready and as usual he joked about putting all the toys in the tub. Tonight he was the one that said "There is no room for me in there!", as I tell him each time he pulls them all out of the chest and dumps them in... three boats, 26 alphabet letters, all his tub toys from when he was just a little guy, and lots and lots of extras we have acquired since then. </p>
<p>Doug read him two books tonight, including "Where the Wild Things Are" and for the first time Doug read "Leonardo, the Terrible Monster"; they both enjoyed them! </p>
<p>Riku took a long time to settle down tonight, which really surprised me. He was just sleeping very lightly, but I knew if I left the room he would be up and calling for me. I haven't heard a peep since I left him though, and it's now 11 p.m. Usually, he wakens once at the forty minute mark or on the hour, so I guess he just needed the time to go into a deeper sleep tonight. </p>
<p>I don't know if I have written this before, but we have a new addition to our sleeping ritual... we always have a story or two, then I sing three songs to both him and Amelia, and they are always the same ones... "The Wheels on the Bus", "You're my Honeybunch" and "Rock-a-Bye Baby". Usually by the time I am on number three they are asleep, especially at nap time. However, I decided the other day to have them take three deep breaths, in and out, then we have a big yawn, and finish off with a big stretch and a "relax" down. It seems to help them settle down ready for sleep, and it worked for me a couple of times too. I don't sleep with the children during their naps, and don't want to either; I need the time when they are sleeping, I'm not a good napper and end up with a headache or feeling grouchy (it's seven plus hours or nothing for me!), and I don't want them to depend on me to get to sleep or stay asleep either. </p>
<p>... and off to bed I go... very soon.</p>
