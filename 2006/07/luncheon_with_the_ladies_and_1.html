								<h2>Luncheon with the "Ladies", and 1592!!!!</h2>
								<p>Gail and I started the day off with our usual game or two of cards and a big bowl of fruit, before getting busy preparing for our luncheon guests, Judi and Jody. I had some laundry to do first and got that out of the way, poured a little Grand Marnier over the dessert, Gail washed the spinach, made up a small plate of strawberries and fresh pineapple, and before we knew it Judi was arriving on the ferry at 10:15 A.M.</p>
<p>Judi looks great, and brought along gifts... a big wheel of Brie, which Gail sliced and put on the fruit plate, a birthday gift for me, and a box of my favourite #16 tea from Harrod's. We sat and visited on the deck until Jody arrived at 11:30, and then made tea and nibbled a bit for an hour. </p>
<p>Lunch was delicious: the mushroom soup was perfect, the fresh tomato bread very tasty, the salad with strawberries fresh and yummy, and then the oh-so-good pots de creme for dessert with tea later on. This was Judy's first visit to Gail and Tom's home, and she was delighted to be here with us; Jody curled up and made herself at home, and even though she had told us she couldn't stay on much later than Judi's 2:40 departure, stayed and chatted until 4:45. It was lovely to have the time to really catch up on all her B&B news, and to fill them in on the family news on our end too. Jody brought Gail a lovely hibiscus which is now the centrepiece in the living room. </p>
<p>I had a drive out to one of the local malls with Jody in her silver Miata convertible, and met Gail, Tom, and Doug there to run a few errands. We went on to a second mall to do a little personal shopping for two hours, while the guys, who had spent a few hours this afternoon together, put in more time waiting for us. Home for dinner... leftovers, but very tasty ones... mushroom soup for Gail and me, lasagna and tomato bread for Doug and Tom, and veggies for all.  </p>
<p>Gail and I were very busy on the computer both before and after dinner, and stuck with it too late until we had found the "lost generation" that was driving us crazy from our hard work on Monday. We did it! All the way back to... are you ready?????.... 1592!!!!! Now, this is not a direct line, as we had hoped to be able to do, but we got stuck on Gram's male line back in 1744, and so decided to continue on with the female side. This takes us to France... Normandy and Grenoble, among other places. We never ever had an inkling of having any French connections but have proudly added it to the English, Irish, Scots, and Germans that make us Rodgers children. </p>
<p>Bed too late.... 12:45, as after our hard work and concentration we had to play two games of cards to settle us down. I still had a difficult time sleeping...</p>
