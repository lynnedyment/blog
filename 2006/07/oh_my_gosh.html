								<h2>Oh My Gosh!</h2>
								<p>The house cooled down last night to 83F! We all slept quite well, as there was a breeze blowing in after midnight, although Gail had trouble falling asleep and so slept in until 8:15 today. I was up on the computer at 7 o'clock and showering when Gail awoke. She went off with Tom to Weight Watchers for a weigh-in, coming home pleased with her half pound gain, despite the Brie cheese, pots de creme, and generous portion of Jody's bread pudding. I'm only up a pound since I left home, so I am pleased as well. We've been eating very well, but with lots of fruit and veg' too, which obviously helps. </p>
<p>We had Judi Speirs' "omelettes in a bag" for breakfast, a great idea if a large number of people need to be fed. We tried it out to test it for Candy and Rick's family reunion and it's going to be a hit. Basically, you beat two eggs in a bowl, add whatever extra ingredients you choose... we had spinach, cheese, shallots, and fresh tomato, add a dab of butter, some pepper and salt, and pour into a one quart Zip-Lock bag. Take the air out, seal it, and drop into a pot of boiling water for twelve minutes for a less generously filled omelette and another five minutes or so for the bigger ones. They were as delicious as Judi's friend claimed they were in her email, fluffy and light and perfect for those large gatherings. They could be done outside on the barbecue on hot mornings. Tea, Gail's and Tom's wonderful seedy toast, and cards followed. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug went out to pick up the gold chain I had taken in for repair work, and Gail and I went outside on the shady front deck for pedicures. It was just lovely out there... much cooler than in the house, so our soak in hot water was just fine. We scrubbed and pumiced, creamed and removed nail polish, polished, and ended it all with a hand wax and foot wax too, leaving us with very soft and refreshed feet. What a treat! </p>
<p>Comet, the neighbour's dog, joined us too; Gail and Tom are her best friends when her owners are out, and sometimes when they are not! </p>
<p>When I awoke the house was at 82F. An hour later we were up to 83F, and now at 6:15 it is 93 degrees! Man, oh man! We have spent most of the day downstairs in the much cooler recreation room, with all of us moaning and groaning each time we came upstairs. </p>
<p>Doug and Tom had lentil loaf sandwiches for lunch; Gail and I had large plates of fresh fruit, all we needed after our big breakfast. Cherries, strawberries, red grapes, and fresh pineapple were the perfect meal for this hot day. </p>
<p>Gail and I had our afternoon tea downstairs while we played cards, Tom and Doug took refuge while reading, and Doug found the energy to pack up the trunk of the car for tomorrow's trip home. I sorted out a large bag of paper I had brought with me, thinking I would have so much spare time! What a dreamer I am; we were far too busy with the family tree, various outings, and cards when we needed a break. I will be returning home with most of the magazines I brought along to pass on to Gail. Ah well, such is the life of a too-much-to-do-in-too-short-a-time person. </p>
<p>We had dinner downstairs too.. veggie burgers and bean salad for the boys, and the last of the cream of mushroom soup and tomato bread for Gail and me. Just before dinner Gail had whipped the two of us up a delicious fruity and refreshing beverage of watermelon, pineapple, and club soda. Too bad we just discovered these, as we could have been drinking them all week long. Ah well, I will be back here in less than two weeks with Riku. </p>
<p>Off at 7 P.M. to take part in some of the Nanaimo Bathtub Race Weekend, an annnual event for over forty years. We plan to stake out a bench, under a big shady tree, take our books along, and enjoy the cool breeze off the water until the fireworks at 10 P.M. Gail and I will head over to the casino for an hour or so, as I must use up my voucher from my win last week.</p>
