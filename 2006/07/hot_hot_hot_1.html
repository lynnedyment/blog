								<h2>Hot, Hot, Hot!!!!!</h2>
								<p>Oh my gosh; British Columbia is not supposed to be this hot! We had a 35C day today, and the temperature in the house when we walked in tonight was 92F. It is now down to a balmy 89F, after having had the windows open and the ceiling fans whiring for over three hours. We leave here on Sunday morning and have been promised even hotter weather in Norther California... quite possibly 113F! </p>
<p>Despite the heat, we had a wonderful day here on Vancouver Island. I awoke very early, having had trouble staying asleep in early morning heat, and had time for a few emails before Gail awoke at 7:10. </p>
<p>We had a very leisurely morning, as usual. Candy called, and I was lucky enough to answer the phone and have a long chat with her before handing it over to Gail. She and Rick are on the way to their trailer tonight, where she won't be allowed to do a thing, thanks to the cortisone shots she had yesterday in her back. </p>
<p>We left the house for the outdoor market on the waterfront, with Doug hoping to buy some fresh curds. They were overpriced, but he did buy a half dozen raisin scones and two jars of homemade jam (rhubarb and Bing cherry). </p>
<p>Gail had packed us another wonderful picnic lunch of fresh salmon sandwiches for all but Doug, who chose once again to have his favourite lentil loaf sandwich. Gail is keeping him well supplied and happy! We also packed up containers of fresh fruit... strawberries, Bing cherries, and crisp red grapes, a nice chunk of the Brie Judi brought over for us, cold Cokes, and two big water bottles for each of us. </p>
<p>Tom found the perfect picnic spot for us, a camping site with a table in the shade, at Englishman River Falls. We all enjoyed our lunch and then went off to see the fast moving falls just a few minutes drive from our site. Doug took lots of photos of the falls and Gail and I took lots of each other. </p>
<p>Yesterday, Gail had called Don Thompson, the local folk artist Susan and Bryn discovered many years ago; he made the nine foot wooden Mountie who lives in our dining room. A visit to his outdoor "gallery" was next on our agenda, and we arrived just a few minutes after Jody and Hal, with whom I had made arrangements last night. What a character he is! Susan, her mom, and Amelia had visited him in May, and I was so impressed and delighted with all the whimsical animals in his yard that I was determined to visit as well. He and his wife, Ann, could not have been more welcoming. They made us feel right at home, with Don giving us the grand tour of the property, each area containing many samples of his work, as well as the "sheds" which were packed full as well. He looks like a West Coast Santa, with a quirky, pun-laden sense of humour, and a twinkle in his eye. We all enjoyed our time there so much and promised to return. He and I also agreed to exchange photos of the Mountie; he has one of it for us and I shall send him one taken in the Mountie's new home. I took dozens and dozens of photos and must send him a couple of them. </p>
<p>A stop at the Coombs market, famous in the area for the goats on the roof, where we picked up some fresh corn on the cob (Gail and I had a hankering for it today), and Doug found new "instant" Indian curries to take home. </p>
<p>Jody and Hal's gorgeous B&B is not too far away, and we had been promised tea and dessert in exchange for a little computer help from Doug. Hal had moved the table out under the trees at the back of the yard, and they had a huge tray Hal had built, filled with tall glasses, a choice of beverages with lots of ice, and a really wonderful blackberry bread pudding with whipped cream atop. Jody has known Doug long enough that she knew this would be a huge hit and it was, with all of us. Their gardens, flower and vegetable, are well ordered and gorgeous, as is the house. What a lovely home they have created for themselves, and all their lucky guests too. You can see it  <a href="http://heritagecottage.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>We had several stops to make on the way home... one to the gallery where Mr. Thompson's art is sold, but alas, it was closed, much too early on a Friday night we felt!... and then into Nanaimo to stock up on Devon custard for SF (Amelia and Riku are particularly fond of it), and get some sand toys to pick up for Riku's beach trips in two weeks; Doug managed to find a few more books on sale while waiting for us. </p>
<p>None of us was particularly hungry after our very generous portions of pudding, and of course the heat didn't have us wishing for anything heavy either, so two cobs of corn, followed by lots of fresh fruit and a little more cheese, was dinner tonight. We sat outside on the deck, waiting for the house to cool down to 89F! Gail and I played cards under the dining room fan, while Doug and Tom chose to read downstairs where it is much cooler. </p>
<p>I'm off to bed at 11:30; the temperature in the dining room is still sitting at 89F!</p>
