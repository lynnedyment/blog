								<h2>Corvallis, Oregon to Centralia, Washington</h2>
								<p>Awoke at 7 A.M., checked email while Doug showered... what a treat on the road! We shared a banana and ate our second half of the wonderful organic strawberries Susan had bought for our trip. We were on the road by 8 o'clock. Topped up our gas at $2.89 a gallon, as we assumed gas would be more expensive along the coast. It was. Headed for Newport, Oregon, along a winding road filled with tall trees and a slow driver in front of us; I quite enjoyed it as the morning was lovely and I sat anticipating a good breakfast on our arrival. </p>
<p>First, however, we drove along the bay road, stopping for a look at a charming lighthouse (not open for viewing until 11 A.M.), and also stopped at a memorial for fishermen and women lost at sea in this area. It was very touching, with personal letters from wives, children, and grandchildren, sitting on the stone memorial carved with so many names. </p>
<p>Marie had given me an article on this town, and Mo's was suggested as the place to eat in town. However, they were not open for breakfast, so we wandered along the main street of this fast-becoming-a-tourist destination --mupscale tourist shops, a shop for cat owners(!), etc. -- and decided on "The Whale's Tale", which looked as though it had been in business for a long time. It was a great spot, as they bake their own whole wheat bread each day as well as a different muffin each day of the week. Doug enjoyed his shrimp omelette as I did my overstuffed with cheddar cheese omelette; he had the (pineapple)muffin, I had the toast, served with freezer jam(!), and the hash browns were delicious as well. </p>
<p>Next on our list was a visit to the aquarium; this is where the "Free Willy" whale was held until public outcry demanded that he be released. It is a terrific and well-laid out exhibit, with a good jellyfish display, as well as otters, sharks, local fish tanks, sea pens, anemones, etc. They had a very good seabird exhibit as well, and we quite enjoyed the puffins. </p>
<p>At 1:15 we headed off to Yaquina Point, to see the tallest lighthouse in the state. Alas, there was a $5 fee and a half hour wait to get into the parking lot, so we drove to nearby Agate Beach, parked the car, walked along a wide sandy beach with sand dunes and gorgeous waves, to take some wonderful shots of the lighthouse from this vantage point. It is always a treat for me to just meander on the beach, so this ended up being just perfect for me. </p>
<p>An hour later we drove to Tillamook, which is home to the cheese factory of the same name. On the self-guided tour, we saw the large tanks of cheese being made, and the huge blocks of it being cut up and packaged for sale. Doug bought two bags of squeaky fresh curds, and we both enjoyed our $1.50-a-scoop ice cream... everyone was eating it, so we really had no choice at all. I chose Oregon strawberry, which Doug decided was better than his peaches and cream. Yum! </p>
<p>Our intention was to go to Cape Meares, to see the smallest lighthouse in Ogegon, and then travel on to see the tallest waterfall. However, we had driven by the cut-off for Cape Meares and decided to forego the waterfall and not be so late getting to Nanaimo tomorrow. So, back we went for fifteen plus miles, and we were so happy we had. We stopped to take photos of huge rocks in the water we had passed by on the wrong side of the road on our way out of town, and just thoroughly enjoyed our search for the lighthouse. </p>
<p>Since it was the smallest lighthouse we had assumed we would have to get to a spot to see it from the highest hill. That assumption was wrong but we did spend fifteen minutes admiring the wonderful views from the beach in that area. A local woman sent us in the right direction, after warning us the road was rough. It was almost all paved, though, except where the there had been a landslide(!), but we loved the scenery along this winding, narrow, and tree-lined road up the side of the mountain. Cape Meares is a beautiful little spot off the main thoroughfare and we were amongst a very small group of people checking it out. The lighthouse is wonderful, as was the walk along the trail of this old growth forest. What a beautiful spot this was, and we couldn't help repeating several times how glad we were that we had come here. We were just leaving when we spotted a a sign for an "octopus tree" and went off to check that out; it was worth the little walk out of our way, as the tree was formed by wind patterns and had eight distinct long "legs" extending upwards around a wide open body at the base. </p>
<p>We laughed at some of the signs we spotted along the road today for tsunamis, rock slides, and land slides as well as elk and deer warning signs along the roads. </p>
<p>So, now having decided not to see the waterfalls this trip, but also having decided we will do that perhaps next year, we headed towards Portland. It was quite a wild ride between the coast and inland, as it was a very well maintained and lonely road, making it very easy, despite the curves, to go a very good pace. However, we also had a monster truck and trailer behind us, often just a little too close behind us(!), and Doug said he felt like we were reliving the movie "Duel" ... not being able to get rid of this guy, even when the size of him should have left him in the dust! </p>
<p>We crossed into the many-bridged city of Portland at 8:30 and an hour later stopped for dinner at "Papa Pete's" in Ridgefield, Washington. We were hungry by this time, having missed lunch, but filled up on fresh fruit brought from home and some chocolate from Susan as well. The pizza was fine and we worked on a crossword puzzle while waiting for it to arrive. </p>
<p>Doug had called earlier to book us a room at the Motel 6 in Centralia, after learning that the one closer one to Oregon was filled. So, a late arrival to our room at 11 P.M. It was just as well that we didn't have an Internet connection here, despite our disappointment, as we were both tired and ready to relax and turn out the light. Bed at midnight...</p>
