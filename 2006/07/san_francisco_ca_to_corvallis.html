								<h2>San Francisco, CA to Corvallis, OR</h2>
								<p>I had a very early start this morning, as I was awake and up at 5:30 A.M. ready to get started on our trip to Oregon! Despite being very well organized last night, bag packed, magazines and food ready to go, etc. we didn't leave the house until 8 o'clock. Just as well, as I had a leisurely morning, with time for emails, a long hot shower to waken me, and no rushing about... just the way a vacation should start. I even made a "bacon" sandwich and a thermos of tea for the road. </p>
<p>We filled up with gas in Fairfield, at $3.07 a gallon, as we didn't think we had enough to get us to Vacaville, where it is usually cheaper. Good thing too, as it was $3.22 a gallon there! We were on I-5 by 9:40, already sunny and hot. Throughout the day, we enjoyed several snacks that we had brought along: almonds, cold fresh Olsen's cherries, chocolate, and our mid-day Cokes.</p>
<p>By noon we were admiring the lovely Mt. Shasta and I was madly snapping photos out the car window. Passed by Soda Creek, a name that I find amusing... I have a mental image of bubbling water(!), and of course were delighted to pass by Castle Crags, a lovely outcropping of majestic rocks, reminiscent of a mountaintop castle. </p>
<p>At 12:30, we stopped in Weed, at a vegetarian restaurant Doug disovered for us on the Internet, called "Buddha's Belly". Yum! We had nice round tummies too, after sharing a cheesy tempeh "Reuben" sandwich and a veggie burger.. both for $12. I had all the sauerkraut and we both enjoyed the delicious mixed green salad served with them. The friendly counter gal filled up our water bottles with their untreated spring mountain water.</p>
<p>An hour later we were back on the road; it was quite hot by this time, but the open windows kept us comfortable. Traffic was moving very nicely for us, and we made much better time than we had anticipated. </p>
<p>Just north of Yreka, before leaving the state, we passed by two metal sculpures. One, of a huge bull, we had seen in the past, but this time decided we would be sure to stop and take a photo of it, which we did. Not much later, we passed a huge and wonderful dragon, and Doug backed the car up so we could get a photo of it as well. </p>
<p>At 2:30, near Ashland Oregon, I was taking photos of brown roundy hills and valleys, with the occasional field of bright yellow... mustard, perhaps? </p>
<p>We stopped for gas at Grant's Pass, Oregon, and were pleased to find it for $2.99. Hard to imagine that this high price would make us happy but we have been hard hit with high gas prices over the past year. </p>
<p>I was admiring the scenery and going through unread newspapers as well, so Doug got to hear a few interesting stories about a town in northeast Oregon that sounds well worth visiting one day, and all about a B&B ranch experience that sounds like a perfect spot for Susan and Kevin to get to in the future. Nothing like having a captive audience! </p>
<p>At last we saw the brown hills turning green and the trees getting taller! It rained for a bit here and there, and what a lovely smell that was, combined with newly cut hay but really just the distinctive smell of rain that is not city rain! How I miss that, and hadn't realized that I had. It was a treat in Ontario too, to see the skies darken and then a storm break out in the way it never does in San Francisco. </p>
<p>We arrived in Corvallis at 6 P.M., much earlier that we thought we would, and easily found another great vegetarian restaurant Doug had tracked down for us. This was called "Nearly Normal's", featuring "Gonzo Cuisine", and we were very pleased with our dinners: vegan manicotti for me, with artichoke hearts and a delicious fennel sauce, and a potato, chili, cheese enchilada for Doug, who finished off with a slice of key lime pie. Cost of dinner... $19.75</p>
<p>Checked into our Motel 6 at 7:30; it is really more of an inn, as all the doors are inside; we have a very large room with two double beds, nicely air-conditioned and with free Internet service too! Checking my mail, I found that Uncle Frank, Glenn, and Gail had all written, plus there were photos of Akane and Riku on the plane and Riku and Mirei with BahBah, Akane's mom. Bryn had written a wonderfully newsy blog all about their flight there and their settling into Akane's mom's home for their first sleep. </p>
<p>Doug and I are both tired after our short sleeps last night; he did most of the driving today and I took over the last three hours. Time for bed, after a few fresh strawberries... 10:30 P.M.</p>
