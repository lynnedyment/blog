								<h2>A Cool and Breezy Tuesday</h2>
								<p>Riku woke up at just past 7 A.M. today. The first words he spoke were "I had a dream last night. Not a bad dream. A good dream." When I asked him what he had dreamed he immediately went into quite a bit of detail: "I dreamed I was in a house upstairs with two woman. No, one woman and one man. I was eating rice. My hands were dirty." I asked if he had been eating it with chopsticks or his hands and he told me "I was eating it with my dirty hands." Interesting that he remembered it so clearly; I don't remember a child this young telling me about a dream, but I think it helped that he had just wakened. </p>
<p>Before getting on with our day, we sat and read five books to his dog and mouse; they were paying close attention, as Riku made sure they could both see the pages, and even reassured them when he thought they might be worried about anything, such as the alligator or the vulture in one book particularly. When I told him I was going to leave and make up his fruit plate he said "Oh, don't leave me. I will be lonely." All these feelings he is expressing so clearly these days!</p>
<p>However, I did get his strawberries, nectarine, and banana on a plate for him, and we took it upstairs to eat while he watched "Caillou" and I had my three-minute shower. I joined him for the last half of the show, as he really likes company when he watches TV. He always has lots of questions to ask, and of course it was such fun to watch his face light up as Caillou spotted a moose drinking from the lake during the camping adventure. Rosie, the little sister, makes Riku smile too, and he was paying lots of attention as she hugged Caillou and he told us what a good brother he was. Riku is too. </p>
<p>We came downstairs for more playtime before breakfast. Once again, Riku was busy making breakfast, for me alone today. I had a lovely fruit plate (gee, I wonder where that idea comes from?) and he apologized that he had only one strawberry, but had two apples and two clumps of grapes. I also had rice, cucumbers, and an egg, plus hot tea of course! Delicious! Riku had a bowl of hot oatmeal today with blueberries and raspberries in it. </p>
<p>Needing a little time on my own to get some things accomplished around the house, I took Riku home at 10 A.M., expecting to have Bryn drop him off at 1 o'clock after lunch with them, and expecting to collect Amelia at 12:15 from school. However, Susan called to say that Amelia has been fighting her naps lately and was still having later naps after the trip to Alaska, so we planned to meet at a playground later if time permitted. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped Riku off at 1:15 for his nap; I had volunteered to have him here, but thought I would be experimenting with gettting both children settled in for their naps. Riku told me he was hungry, and so had two little ginger cookies, milk, and a dish of custard. His grandpa joined him too, and they discussed how Grandpa likes fruit in his custard, but Riku prefers his plain. </p>
<p>He napped from 1:40-3:40, which was perfect time-wise, but he was still groggy when he woke up! Lately he acts as though he cannot get enough sleep. I think it must be a growth spurt, as he is eating far more than usual too, and I guess the sleeping more is part of it. </p>
<p>He even said he was going to nap in the stroller on the way to the playground(!)... insisting that the hood be kept down as it was darker. He was trying to sleep I think, but didn't, but then wanted to sit in the stroller when we got to the park; this has never happened before! He didn't want to play in the sandbox; he really just wanted to sit and watch the other children playing.</p>
<p>Finally, I talked him into racing with me around the grassy area and  he perked up. Akane showed up with Mirei just as we had started in at this, and then he went on to climb around on the dome, and told me I should exercise on it too. Once again he showed us his elbow, so we could feel how strong he is; what a guy! I did a little hanging around on the dome so he could see I was exercising too. He told Bryn the other day that if you watch TV your muscles get soft, so he is certainly getting the idea that we need to move our bodies, and reminding me to do so as well. </p>
<p>We left the playground about 6 o'clock, and Riku walked all the way home. On the way there, he had spotted some orange plastic pellets and had me picking them up for him, but on the return trip he found lots more and we collected them together. The fresh air was obviously just what he needed, as he was such a happy boy by the time I said goodbye at their door. Mirei had dropped off to sleep almost as soon as they got to the playground. </p>
<p>Doug was at T'ai Chi when I arrived home; I made a bowl of my "instant" soup with kale, ww pasta, and celery, made a cup of tea and read as I ate my dinner. Still sorting through baskets of paperwork, got a few more emails answered and now am down to just twelve, the most important twelve of them all, as they require longer answers... I'm so far behind with them! </p>
<p>Doug came home, ate his usual after-class burrito, and got right back to work on the looming deadline; this should be the second last night and then it's done! I went off to bed and had the lights out at 11:30...</p>
