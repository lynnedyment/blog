								<h2>Three Days to Ottawa!</h2>
								<p>Doug and I had a quiet morning at home; I was determined to get lots done today and did so... laundry, vacuumed upstairs and down to this level again, sorted out all the items that are going to Ontario and put them in the bedroom in one place, cleared out the upstairs hallway where too many suitcases are stored, and cooked up rhubarb for Doug... all this along with time for a leisurely breakfast over the Sunday paper. Doug and I also went through the B.C. trip photos, so that he could get them into an album for me. There are over 270 of them, after careful culling! It's ridiculous! ... but they sure are nice to have. </p>
<p>I called Bryn to suggest that he bring Mirei over for a visit; turned out my timing was perfect as he had been about to leave for a visit with the children to Susan's and Kevin's. Mirei has a long nap in the morning so it made sense for her to have it here; that way Amelia and Riku could play without worries about being too loud for the baby. It also meant that I could have some time alone with her, which doesn't happen very often at all. Akane was at the studio so this worked out well for everyone. </p>
<p>Mirei rolled around on the living room carpet, sat up for the longest time ever, bending way over to pick things up from beside her, and then easily getting herself back to a sitting position. I took lots of photos of her, of course, but haven't seen them yet. Doug is still busy working on the other thousand of them waiting to be dealt with! </p>
<p>I gave her a huge portion of cereal that Bryn had brought over for her. She likes to eat, this little girl(!), and her little tongue would stick out when she was ready for the next bite, and she would lean forward. It was adorable, and Bryn said later the funniest thing of all is to hear the low rumbling grunting sounds she makes when she wants more faster. Doug got a few perfect photos of that open mouth waiting for more. </p>
<p>I gave her some warm breast milk in a sippy cup and she did very well with it, although next time I will use a regular cup as she does well with that too and I can see how far to tip it back for her. I took her into Riku's room, turned on the sound machine, lay her on her back, surrounded by pillows, tucked a blanket firmly around her, and lay below her, where she couldn't see me, and rubbed her tummy gently in circles. She tried once to get up and twice cried out, but in less than five minutes I was walking out the door, closing it quietly behind me. What an easy baby! </p>
<p>Mirei slept for an hour and a half; by then Bryn and Riku were here for lunch, and once Bryn left with Mirei for nursing at the studio, I tucked Riku into bed. Bryn dropped Akane at home with Mirei, Riku napped for an hour on the nose, and Bryn came by and spent a little time with him here. They went off home, leaving me a little time to continue with packing chores; Riku had some time on his tricycle around their house, and Doug and I went over for a little time with the children there before dinner. </p>
<p>Mirei was sitting in the high chair in the kitchen when we walked in, watching her mommy cook, but she joined Riku and me in his room, sitting on the bed and playing happily with the toys that Riku ran to get for her. He goes over to her now and then to give her a gentle hug and a kiss, or to take away anything of his that she is getting too close to. He told her, "No chewing, Mirei!" as he took one of his books from her and then asked why babies chew so many things. </p>
<p>Riku's first words, always, when we walk in are, "Come play with me in my room." and lately he has started enticing us in with "I have something very interesting to show you!" raising his eyebrows for emphasis. Doug and Bryn were busy working at a few projects, so we played with Lego, read a couple of books, and Riku played two of his Japanese song books, which caught Mirei's attention each time. Riku sings along in Japanese with most of them.</p>
<p>Akane had cooked a delicious meal for us, as always... a Chinese noodle dish, sweet and sour tofu, and a lightly fried rice dish. Riku ate a nice big plate of dinner, trying to use his chopsticks ("How I use these?") and trying hard to copy Doug. Bryn is the left-handed guy though, and my guess is that he will be the one teaching Riku how to use them one day. Mirei sat at the table with us in her new IKEA highchair, eating another huge bowl of rice cereal with sweet potato added to it. Those two little teeth aren't ready for anything more quite yet, but no doubt she will be eating everything on her plate too. </p>
<p>Had a little more time together after dinner in Riku's room with Mirei; got Riku into his PJs with teeth brushed before leaving around 9 P.M. Doug and I spent some time on the computer before heading up to bed. </p>
<p>... Oh, Riku said tonight, "I usually have the glass with the star on it." First time we have heard him say "usually".</p>
