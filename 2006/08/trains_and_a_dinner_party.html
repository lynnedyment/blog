								<h2>Trains and a Dinner Party</h2>
								<p>Riku had been talking about our train ride for a few days, as I had told him all about it. It was only an hour long, and went from Nanaimo to Qualicum Beach, but with views of the water and the "forest". We arrived early and had lots of time to run around outside the station with Riku urging all three of us to get "on your mark, get set, GO!", and racing to beat us. Gail and I each made him a little ghost out of a tissue as well, tying the necks with some long weeds. They worked well and provided a little diversion while we waited for the 10:40 train. Within ten minutes of getting on, Riku was lulled to sleep by the motion of the train. I was very surprised, as he had slept well and didn't awaken until just after 7 A.M. </p>
<p>Jody and Hal were at the station to greet us, and Jody had a lovely little "treasure box" for him. He really liked it a lot and by the end of the day it already contained some interesting bits and pieces. Tom had driven there to meet us, and we all walked into Qualicum Beach to check out the Don Thompson folk art pieces. The store has interesting and varied works by many artists and I liked so much of it. In fact, I spotted a metal "Scottie" that I thought Jody would really like. She did, and I bought it for her and Hal as a very belated wedding gift. Then I thought what a perfect wedding gift one of Don Thompson's animals would make for Susan and Kevin; I had pretty much decided on a sweet puppy and bone, in a reclining position, but then spotted a gorgeous standing black and white dog named "Ranger" who just looked the perfect fit for the Doering/Ellis family. He's now standing guard in Gail and Tom's living room and is just wonderful. </p>
<p>A picnic lunch at Parksville was next on the agenda. It was a little cooler than we hoped it would be, although the sun was shining. Riku was tired, and we decided to forego the promised beach time until tomorrow morning, so he would have a longer time to play. </p>
<p>He entertained us all the way home by singing many songs to us, in both Japanese and in English. Riku really loves to sing, and the songs come from his heart; to hear him sing "Ten Little Ducks" is just the sweetest thing, as he gets sad and weepy sounding when they all have disappeared and then is so joyful when they all come back! </p>
<p>Once home and after his story, it was pretty obvious he wasn't going to nap at all. I guess the thirty-five minutes this morning made that impossible, so after a bit I decided it made more sense for him to have an earlier night tonight. So, up we got and the rest of the afternoon passed by quickly. We sat together and watched part of "Shrek 2", which he had spotted in our bedroom last night. Then, since Gail and I were playing cards for a bit, he decided he wanted to play too. We played a very simple version of "Go Fish", basically just trying to match up the cards that were turned over on the floor, and ended up throwing handsful up in the air. He had so much fun doing this, and now they are all carefully hidden under the sofa, where he stashed them. Bubbles outside on the deck, followed by helping Auntie Gail water the plants on the deck and then downstairs in the garden. He really loved doing this with her, and then she walked him across the street to meet Marilyn, owner of "Comet", Gail and Tom's surrogate dog. </p>
<p>Riku had a big plate of a two-egg mushroom and spinach omelette earlier, followed less than two hours later by a plate of strawberries, cheese, and more veggie "bacon", which he ate earlier as well. </p>
<p>At six P.M. we all went next door to the neighbour's for a cul-de-sac party consisting of four families with a grand total of twelve people, all adults except Riku. He was just wonderful! He told everyone his name when they asked and then asked what their names were. He chatted with everyone, showed each one his new treasure box and the contents but asked them not to take anything out. Gail took the bubbles over, so that kept him busy for a while as well, and Gail and I took turns going down to the garden with him. The biggest excitement of all was the appearance of two deer again tonight! He and I stood and watched them while they nibbled at the flowers and finally disappeared into the ravine behind their house. After having snacked on cheese and crackers, Riku ate chicken, corn on the cob, and several small glasses of milk. He was very comfortable asking for things he wanted, and Susan, our host, was just wonderful with him. Riku sat drawing at the table while we ate. When we left all the women commented on what a well mannered and good little boy he was; he said thank you and goodbye to them all as we left for tub time. </p>
<p>While he was playing in the tub, I told him how proud I was of his behaviour. Riku liked the idea of a party and obviously enjoyed it very much; what a sociable little fellow he is! </p>
<p>And of course he was a tired boy after this long day. He had a quick tub, another Robert Munsch book, and was asleep in less than seven minutes. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom just came home and said everyone, including the men, told them how wonderful Riku had been, especially without another child to interact with him. I agree totally... and would have added, "and tired too!"</p>
<p>Time for tea and cards, and my pots de creme; we have saved Riku's for tomorrow, after naptime. They were a huge hit, not surprisingly.</p>
