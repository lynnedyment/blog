								<h2>Lunch with Friends and the Water Park</h2>
								<p>Today was a full and busy day, starting with a quiet morning at home with Riku. Usually we go off to a park or playground before lunch and naptime but Judi, Taryn, and Jody were invited for lunch, and so we opted for a less busy morning today. Riku watched Stuart Little 2, and liked it just as much as he did the first one. Once I was up and showered, I sat with Riku while he ate his fruit plate and watched the movie along with him. It's so much nicer to have company for this, as he has lots of questions about "What's happening?" and gets the answers. The voices of all the characters are just wonderful in these movies, and just as much fun for adults as children. They are, after all, Gail and Tom's movies!</p>
<p>Gail was busy getting a few things done in the house that have been neglected since our arrival. With our busy days out with Riku, the house needed a quick vacuuming, and a little dusting. Tom went out to  do a few errands, including some for me, and the first few hours flew by. Tom and I went down with Riku to meet Judi and Taryn, due in on the 10:30 ferry. Taryn looks wonderful; she looked fabulous at her wedding a year and a bit ago, but has lost forty pounds since then, and is as slim as can be. Marriage obviously agrees with her! Judi came bearing gifts as always, and this time some of my favourites: her homemade jam... blackberry and red currant. Yum! </p>
<p>Riku was a little shy with them, and had a little trouble sharing me too. He wanted me to stay in the living room with him, and not to talk with them. It took me longer than it should have to realize that, despite a full banana, a generous portion of strawberries, a good sized bowl of bran buds with milk, and a glass of milk on top of it all, that he was hungry! I can't keep him filled up this week! I scrambled two eggs and toasted a slice of Gail's bread, and within ten minutes he was his usual happy and sociable self. </p>
<p>He did the most amazing thing this morning. He had been colouring on his own in the living room, while I sat on the deck with Gail, Judi, and Taryn, and when I went in to give him his second breakfast he was arranging the markers into the letters of his name! He had already done the R and the I, and was just realizing that the ten he had wouldn't do for the last two letters. I got out his markers from home, and within minutes he had figured out how to make them using six more. I was astounded and he realized he had done something worth sharing with everyone; he got Taryn in to have a look at it, and she stayed inside with him and they worked at more letters. </p>
<p>Riku had also been working all week on a single drawing; it looked somewhat like a stained glass window. We were all flabbergasted at how carefully he worked away at it each day; Gail kept asking him if she could have it when he finished. Today he told her once again she couldn't; the reason? He had to show it to Mirei, and his mommy and his daddy. He was marking off large areas into various shapes, and then colouring each section in using different colours. Sometimes an area would be broken down into even smaller sections. Today he finished it! (Auntie Gail has stolen it away, but promised me she would give it back if he noticed it missing. She thinks she is going to be a wealthy woman one day when she sells this original art work by  John Riku Dyment.) I took photos of it in various stages, though, so we shall have a record of it. </p>
<p>Jody arrived a little later than she had hoped; she has a full house at the B&B this long weekend and had things to do before coming for lunch. We had some tea first, and then wine was poured just as she drove up. Gail had made a lovely mixed green salad with strawberries this morning, I made the maple syrup/oil and vinegar dressing. I made the crÃªpes the day before, while Gail made the mushroom filling. She baked it early to keep the heat down at noon hour, and the cheese sprinkled over the top, a wonderful Asiago, had Riku suggesting to Auntie Gail that she smelled! Gail had also put together a lovely plate of fresh tomatoes, basil, and tiny boccocini cheese, for a Caprese salad. Last night while I was tucking Riku in, she made six cups of delicious coconut custard; the entire lunch was a hit, and Judi suggested they all go to Gai's once a month for lunch. </p>
<p>I tucked Riku in and he napped while we had tea and custard, but awoke too early, just as Judi and Taryn were leaving for their ferry. There was time for a few group photos and a sleepy little fellow is leaning on my shoulders in them. </p>
<p>Jody stayed on for a little extra time, and brought the most beautiful summer dress for Mirei... for next summer or perhaps one more after that, and a darling little bedtime bear with a heat pack in it, both in soft perfect colours for Mirei. </p>
<p>We were waffling as to where to go with Riku; he needed to get out for some exercise, and I finally decided, because of the heat, that we would return to the water park. I am so glad we did, because it was the perfect final evening in Nanaimo for Riku. He took one look around, and after being told that I hadn't brought his swim trunks, decided he would just wear his underwear. And then, much to my surprise, he wanted his shirt off, just like another boy his age! </p>
<p>The sweet little boy who was there the day before was there again; there was another little boy, a fearless little guy, whom Riku spent lots of time with, and what a time he had! Tonight, the water hoses were familiar and even more fun for him; he got as much water sprayed on him as he sprayed on others (but not me tonight!), and because he kept his rubber sandals on, he was able to really run about, jumping and splashing in the puddles and streams. He also noticed his new-found friend dunking his hat in the water, and then putting it on, so Riku instantly did the same thing. He ran through the high fountains, got soaking wet, climbed the steep slide with no hesitation at all... what a big change within the past few weeks, and even this week! </p>
<p>We stayed long enough that he had cooled off completely and really was tired from the exertion of his busy hour plus there. Home for dinner, and a long tub. Even the tub was such a change for him tonight. Last night he realized when I was getting his PJs out that he hadn't taken the animals out of the tub. I told him I would do it later, but he insisted he had to tidy them up. Back he went in the cool tub and lined them all up beautifully. Tonight, before getting out of the tub, he took them out, lining them up of course on the edge, but then proceeded to clean the tub with a cloth. This was adorable; he asked for a dry cloth and started wiping down all the edges and ledges, doing such a good job on each area before starting in on another. Gail should hire him; that tub was just shining and dry by the time he finished up, even though I was trying to convince him that it looked great. He moved around on the floor of the tub so he could get at it all. While all this was going on he was chatting away to himself... shall try to capture some of it. "When I get big I will clean the walls, and get a ladder and clean the ceiling, and fix the lightbulbs (one had burned out), and wash the floor and clean up, and sweep the floors..." and on and on it went! </p>
<p>But the best part of all was seeing how much he enjoyed the action of the Jacuzzi jets. Last night he did sit down and enjoy it, but tonight the jets went on full right from the beginning, and after Gail showed him how to turn a dial to make it bubble up furiously, he did that, sitting and grinning away in the midst of the bubbling madness of fast churning water. Wow! He is going to miss this the most, I think. </p>
<p>Riku had a little trouble getting to sleep again tonight; it is still hot in his room, although not quite as much as last night. Once he was asleep, I packed up our suitcase, and then went down to help Gail and Tom pack up "Ranger" (the folk art dog) for the trip home. Tom had kindly scoured around town, on this holiday Monday, to find a box for Ranger, and bought bubble wrap to keep him safe. This took quite a long time, and we ended our day with a few games of cards, and tea... bed at 11 P.M.</p>
