								<h2>Beach and Playground Day</h2>
								<p>Well, our wonderful streak of good weather continues for this trip as well, without the high temps, but with the sun shining and blue skies. Lucky us! Tom had to take his Mom to the doctor today so dropped us at Swyalana Lagoon, along the seawall in Nanaimo. It is a sheltered little beach, and at 9:30 in the morning was deserted as well. A couple of other children were there a little later on, but Riku kept himself happy with the sand toys Gail and Tom had bought for him, and a few trips to the water's edge for sand castle building too. </p>
<p>This is just the life for Riku; lots of space to wander about, and as much sand as he requires for all the things he likes to do: building with Nana and finding "treasures"... feathers, stones, shells, and of course sticks, which Auntie Gail put in the big bucket for him. </p>
<p>Comet, the neighbour's dog, was over for a visit today; he came to the beach too, and Gail took him for a long walk and then they sat on the wall behind us when Comet was ready for a rest. </p>
<p>Tom came by at 10:30 to see if we were ready to leave, and since we weren't, he took Comet home with him. Riku his lunch on the beach, and we gathered up the toys for our meeting with Tom at noon hour. There was just enough time for me to buy Riku his first (by me anyway) vanilla ice cream on a stick, covered with chocolate. He enjoyed every bite of it! </p>
<p>What a hard time he had keeping his eyes open for the seven-minute ride home. I got him right into bed and he slept for an hour and twenty minutes; not quite long enough perhaps, but he played happily on the deck, did some drawing, had snacks on the deck with me, and watched "Winnie the Pooh" while Gail and I did a little computer work beside him in the office. I sat with him and watched a bit too; Gail is a big Pooh fan as well, so we all enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Riku had fun following Comet around, kissing him on the back, and apologizing to him if he bumped into him. He is very gentle with him, and cooed away at him all day long. Riku and I played cards on the floor, finding the kings and queens, and finally just having "card rain" which meant throwing them all up in the air and letting them fall down over and around us. The afternoon passed quickly.</p>
<p>Gail cooked a wonderful dinner of grilled salmon, corn on the cob, and a big plate of raw veggies; we had it early so that we could head off to the Maffeo-Sutton park, near the beach we went to this morning. It is a huge and wonderful playground and perfect except for the stones on the ground, which got into all of our sandals... Gail's, mine, and Riku's. Gail finally gave up and sat on a bench with Tom; Riku didn't seem to mind much, as he spent most of his time up on the wooden structures, and I learned to pick my feet up high, which seemed to help. Riku had a great time, climbing up a high dome, and trying out things he normally would pass by. He ended up his hour here by picking up as many sticks as he could carry; we managed to find a good "hiding" place for them before leaving, and we might get back to find them another day. </p>
<p>Home for tub time, a nice relaxing end to his day. Auntie Gail read "Alexander the Wind-Up Mouse" to Riku, and then I tucked him in. Card and tea time followed, and then Gail and I got to work on the computer, working on the Lee side of the family. We don't have much down for them, but discovered another sibling we didn't know about, and learned that our great-grandfather Lee was not married to Parnell as Mom had always believed, but a Pownall. We could see how easily this could have been misheard over all the years, and discovered some birth dates for their family of six children, born in the late 1800s. Still a mystery... was she the first or second wife, as we know one of them died giving birth to our grandfather. More to explore as soon as we have time. </p>
<p>Bedtime at 11 P.M. for me...</p>
