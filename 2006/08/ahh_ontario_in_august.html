								<h2>Ahh, Ontario in August</h2>
								<p>Woke at 8:15 this morning, just in time to get Uncle Frank's breakfast on the table, so that we could sit together and eat before he left for his swimming physio at Shaver's. After he left, I stripped his bed and discovered he had a duvet cover, and not a comforter!, so that could be washed as well. Showered, talked to Beth, Glenn, and Kelly, and there went my morning. I also had time to delete all the junk emails from the server, leaving me with about fifteen to answer at some point. </p>
<p>UF and I had lunch together, a three-salad combination from food I brought home from Candy's and Rick's. He was hungry after his swimming session, and we sat with our tea and chatted for a while after lunch. Then off we went for a drive in the country; it was overcast when we started out, with a few sprinkles here and there, but the sun had broken through before long. </p>
<p>Our first stop was at the friendly "Mountain Road lady", who sells her own wonderful produce. We had bought strawberries from her in June,and now she had wonderful peaches, blackberries, gorgeous tomatoes, and Concord grapes; we couldn't resist any of them. </p>
<p>Then we went off to a pottery place UF had discovered on his own last month; he had bought some cereal bowls and bread and butter plates, and thought there were flaws in them. The lovely Swiss woman told him the two streaks were just part of the drying process and so he happily had her bundle them up for him again. </p>
<p>I had mentioned to UF that we hadn't been to the cheese factory he had mentioned on my last trip home; he was quite sure he could find it, and after a stop for directions we did indeed find it, on a parallel road from where he had thought it was. He hasn't been there in years so I was impressed! We made it there with minutes to spare before the 5 P.M. closing, thank goodness, and got to sample both of their cheeses... a delicious "white, bloomy rind cheese with a silky, semi-soft interior"... soooo good! and a "washed rind cheese fashioned after recipes developed by the Trappist Monks of the Loire Valley" called "Niagara Gold". UF bought a nice (expensive) hunk of the first which cost $17, but which will be delicious with our fruit platters. </p>
<p>Next on the list was a stop at our wonderful rose spot from June; we wanted to check and see her prices for peaches and UF decided next trip we will buy the white fleshed peaches, which are sweeter than the red variety. I bought some new potatoes though, as they looked too good to resist. </p>
<p>Finally we headed back to the Falls from the Niagara-on-the-Lake district, stopping for groceries at the A&P before picking up our Tuesday night special at "A Fine Kettle of Fish": fish and chips for $4.25 a portion, a bargain for sure. </p>
<p>Home for dinner, groceries away, checked email quickly, and called San Francisco. Amelia was not answering the phone, but Riku was home, and we had a short chat. He told me he was "just sending you a message; I am drawing two pictures, not on the whiteboard, but on paper, one for you and one for Uncle Frank." He was "playing with Daddy and Mirei" and soon told me he had to go, no time for a song, but maybe tomorrow as he was busy with his sister and daddy. Wow! I could hear such a change in his voice and in the way he is talking now; interesting how a week can make such a difference, but I know it's different when I hear the children's voices on the phone too. Mirei has cut a third tooth, on her top right! Bryn tried to get her to make some sounds for me, but she wasn't in the mood and I could only hearing her briefly.</p>
<p>Grapes and tea, a crossword puzzle, and port while trying to do a NY Times crossword in the living room. The Niagara Falls Review puzzle was a little tougher tonight but nothing compared to the NYT! </p>
<p>Bed at 12:15... lights out at 1 A.M.... still too late! </p>
<p>Notes from Bryn today: Lying in bed at night, Riku said, "You're nice, Daddy."  I replied, "Thanks Riku... I'm glad that you think so." He replied, "I'm glad that you're nice."  He is just such a supremely special little guy.</p>
<p>His "reading" is astounding.  Getting better and better at calling out <br />
all the letters on the fronts of his books.  Upper and lower case.  <br />
Faster and faster at it.</p>
<p>He can almost write "DYMENT" from memory, and just wrote "JOHN" for the first time tonight. "JOHN RIKU DYMENT" uses 13 of the 26 letters, so once he can write his name he's halfway there.</p>
