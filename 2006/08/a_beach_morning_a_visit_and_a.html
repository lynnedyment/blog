								<h2>A Beach Morning, a Visit, and a New Playground</h2>
								<p>What a life this is... up earlier than usual this morning, at 6:30, but the time flew by. Riku had a big fruit plate as usual, and finished off with a bowl of bran buds. We were amazed that he liked them but he said they were "just like granola". Off to the beach at 9:30, as Tom had to take his mom to the doctor again. </p>
<p>It was much hotter there today; Riku had the beach to himself once more, until an eleven-year-old boy named Jan, from South Carolina, visiting his grandparents, joined him. They had such a good time, fetching water, and creating a nice village of sand castles; Jan was a great companion and we were sorry when it was time for him to leave. Riku and I continued building more castles, and he wasn't too happy when it was time to leave at 11:30. I didn't want him falling asleep in the car, however, so we sang all the way home. This worked; he reminded me of a song I hadn't heard for years using both hands and fingers. The refrain is, "How are you this morning? Very well I thank you." and it kept Riku happy singing until we reached Galiano Drive. </p>
<p>Gail, Riku, and I ate outside on the little front deck; a lovely plate of assorted goodies for the adults... hummous, olives, a slice of homemade bread, and the end of Akane's inari. Riku ate a big lunch... a scrambled egg, the rest of Auntie Gail's homemade toast, 3/4 of an inari, and a container of yogurt, before tucking in at 12:30. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom went out for a few groceries; I tidied up the kitchen, made tea, answered a couple of emails, and set cards ready to go on the table. We had three games, many cups of delicious tea; Gail bought a light cream for a dish but knew she wouldn't use it all. We are having vanilla tea and with the cream, we just purr happily away. </p>
<p>Riku awoke a happy boy, running about on the deck, being silly and playing with Auntie Gail. He was hungry again and asked for fruit, which he ate while we sat and chatted together on the front deck again. He loves being able to go to one of two decks. Yesterday he told me it was very quiet in Nanaimo, and ended his comment by saying, "This was a good day, huh?", with which I agreed wholeheartedly. </p>
<p>Off to visit with Etta, Tom's mom, at 3:30. What a diplomatic little socializer Riku was! We were all amazed by him, as after greeting Etta with a big hug (she is Uncle Tom's mom, after all!), he then went around the main room saying hello to all the dear souls in their wheelchairs, holding the hands of those who wanted to touch him, and even leaning forward for one of them so she could touch his hair. They asked questions and he answered them, often filling in the conversation with statements such as his daddy, mommy, and sister being in San Francisco, and telling everyone I was his Nana. Today at the beach he told someone we were his Nanas, pointing to Gail and me. Gail was delighted. Needless to say, he was a hit, and those of the residents who were fine mentally smiled away at him and waited for another visit. He obliged by going over to show them how he could blow bubbles in his cup of water. Etta delighted him by pretending to be frightened by this, and he laughed and laughed each time she did it. </p>
<p>By 4:30 he was ready for some action, so off we went to Beban Park to a new playground. This was a great place, despite the loose gravel on the ground, obviously the favoured cover around here. We are spoiled in SF with our nice cushy comfortable bases on so many playgrounds. Riku must have climbed up the "rock" wall and gone down the tunnel slide about thirty times this afternoon! He was just tearing around, but not until after "Dr. Dyment" had made Gail and I his "patients", giving us both "horrible medicine but you have to take it", and making us lie down in the hospital "beds", most uncomfortable, and not built for more than large children. What a riot we had, laughing so hard and taking lots of photos of each other, after the "helicopter crashes" and trips to the hospital. This was just the grandest afternoon! </p>
<p>I popped Riku into the tub, feeding him "some food" while in there, as he was obviously far too hungry to wait fifteen minutes for dinner. He had Canadian cheddar cheese and a half-dozen grapes while playing with his animals, and then ate a whole piece of grilled salmon ("Hey! this is salmon!"), a half cob of buttered corn, and brown rice (two helpings), plus steamed broccoli. </p>
<p>He and I went out on the back deck and kept ourselves busy while Gail and Tom cleared up the dinner dishes. We blew bubbles, did a puzzle in jiffy time (Riku, that is!), and swept the deck. Riku went over with Uncle Tom to get Comet, so Riku could play with him for a while and he introduced him to a new "dog" of AG's and UT's. Comet was not impressed but did stay outside while Riku finished every bite of his dinner, hoping for something to drop. </p>
<p>Then Riku helped Auntie Gail water the garden at the front; he does a good job at it, taking it seriously and making sure every flower gets a good soaking. He was working on a second puzzle to show UT how he does them so quickly, but he was obviously tired, as he could barely concentrate. Daddy called through on Skype just as it was tuck-in time, but he was still hungry, and had a banana and a whole tub of yogurt. I don't know where he's putting it, but he has gained a full pound since arriving here. All this fresh air and running around makes for one hungry boy! </p>
<p>He chatted with his parents and really wanted to hear Mirei talk; at one point he said he wanted to touch her, and had a big smile break out when he heard her voice. Bryn told us she is now crawling backwards! Wow! </p>
<p>Auntie Gail read him his current favourite book, a Robert Munsch, where hair runs and holds onto a bottom(!), and I just smiled and smiled as I heard that big uproarious laughter at his favourite part. </p>
<p>Asleep in less than five minutes after I started singing to him... this was such a wonderful day with him, and I know he had a fabulous time. He said again tonight on the deck, "This was a fun day, huh?", just as he did earlier, and tonight in the bathroom while brushing his teeth, he said "Nanaimo is a nice place. I would like to live here." I have never heard comments about our days or places like this before, although I know that Bryn often asks him if he had a fun day. Nice to hear Riku commenting about his feelings.  </p>
<p>Another interesting thing is that Riku will often tell you why he was "angry" and in the bathroom told me he was a "little bit angry today at the beach, so I broke the castles." I told him that was okay because they were his castles, but he really wanted to let me know he was angry when he did it. </p>
<p>Cards, tea, and an early night for us; Gail was up far too early this morning, at 5 o'clock, and I am ready to sit and read for a while.</p>
