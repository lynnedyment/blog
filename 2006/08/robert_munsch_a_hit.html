								<h2>Robert Munsch... a Hit!</h2>
								<p>Off to Chemainus this morning at 9:30, after a lovely start to our day, with Riku drawing on the deck, keeping busy with his books, and wandering about this floor of the house. Tom had booked tickets for at the theatre in Chemainus before we arrived, so we stopped there first to get our hands stamped, before the crowds arrived. Riku wanted one on each hand, and they kindly obliged. </p>
<p>As a child, Tom had gone to "Billy's" for ice cream and we had promised Riku some before the play. He tasted chocolate and strawberry before deciding on the latter, and Auntie Gail bought it for him. He asked for a cup, which suprised me, and Gail and I could not resist a plate of french fries to share. Riku had some too. </p>
<p>We could see crowds of people heading to the theatre well before the doors opened, and so were not first in line by any means. However, we were lucky enough to get second row seats, which put us close enough to the stage that Riku had a great view of all the action. What a time he had! He laughed and howled and even called out a couple of times to the four wonderful young actors, who made it a point to make eye contact during all six of the short stories. Of course, the big hit was "The Paper Bag Princess", the only story Riku recognized. Thank goodness Gail had it on hand downstairs, as I read it to him on the way there and in the theatre while we waited for the lights to dim. The dragon was terrific, although the cast played it all so over the top that all the children were just delighted with it. A hit for sure! The cast came outside after the performance and Riku had a chance to say hello to all of them and get his photo with them as well. </p>
<p>Before leaving Chemainus, we stopped to take a photo of a beautiful home with a wonderful children's cottage in the front yard. Riku was intrigued and would have loved to have knocked on the big rounded door, straight out of a fairy tale. There are some lovely homes in this town; might be worth having a look around to see about prices for retiring here. The beach is right at the end of the road too! </p>
<p>Riku must be going through a big growth spurt, as I can't keep enough food going into him lately! He had a huge breakfast before we left the house... a full fruit plate, consisting of a whole banana, half a dozen big strawberries, and grapes. Three slices of veggie "bacon" followed, plus Gail's toasted homemade bread, and finally a bowl of bran buds, which are very filling. The minute we were in the car for the trip home, he asked for food, and thank goodness I had scrambled two eggs for the cooler, and had juice and WW crackers, and fish crackers too. This managed to keep him awake for the half-hour trip home; thank goodness, as he was a tired boy and slept from 1:15 to 3 P.M. </p>
<p>Gail and I played cards, had our tea, and then spent a little time on the computer with our continuing family research. We are now looking for the maiden name of our maternal grandmother's mother, not easy when her married name was Mary Lee. There are hundreds of them! </p>
<p>Once Riku was awake, we had snacks outside on the deck, did more drawing (Auntie Gail really really wants to keep this latest drawing of his, but Riku insists he has to show it to Mirei, and his parents). It's lovely, and looks like a stained glass window. </p>
<p>Gail and I did lots of running around on the deck with Riku, all of us shrieking at the various witches and monsters, who changed faces many times over. Riku always likes there to be one person who can "rescue me!" when the enemy comes too close. Ice cream on a stick was a nice treat for him after his nap, but he also filled up with yogurt and stawberries.</p>
<p>Once it got too hot on the deck, we came in to the computer room. Riku watched "Stuart Little", the first time I believe he has seen it, and a first for me too. The fan was going, Riku was still in his underwear from his nap, and life was good. Gail was scrolling for more clues, and in between possible "sightings", I sat with Riku and enjoyed the movie very much as well. Riku had lots of questions about what was happening, and it was fun for both of us to have company while watching this sweet film. At one point Gail found a new "hit" and I came in and printed up the 1881 England Census form for Mary Lee, born in 1857; Mary was married to William Lee and they are the parents of our Mom's dad, Henry Lee. </p>
<p>We had a simple dinner tonight... grilled veggie "dogs"; it was too hot to cook anyway, and too hot for the adults to eat much. I cooked mac' and cheese for Riku with tomato and mushrooms, and a half cob of corn. He ate every single bite, plus another slice of Gai's bread and lots of milk. As soon as dinner was over, Gail, Riku (in his Hawaiian shorts and tops... almost too small for him now but still cool!) walked over to a nearby playground; it's old and not too exciting, but Riku climbed up on the wooden structure for a bit, slid down the slide a few times. Mostly, though, he wanted Gail and me to be monsters, and witches, and action figures and take turns chasing each other. Of course there were some sticks for collecting, and a tunnel to explore, and Riku's cheeks were pink with the heat and the running by the time we headed home for a cool bath. </p>
<p>I let him sit and play for a longer time tonight, just to relax and cool down. He could sit for an hour interacting with all the animals, but he wanted to draw for a bit too, and did a puzzle with Uncle Tom looking on. Bed time at 8:10. Sleep came hard tonight, though, as the room was very hot, and Riku just will not sleep without a top on; it was too warm, however, and so I waited patiently while he scratched, and wiggled, and drank water, went to the bathroom an extra time (lots of fluid today!), and asked questions. Man oh man, I was more than ready for my tea when those eyes finally shut! </p>
<p>I called Jody about lunch arrangements on Monday, and had talked with Judi earlier in the day. Sat on the cool dark deck with Gail and Tom for a half hour, before coming in for cards and bed at 11 P.M., but had a little Skype exchange with Bryn before calling it a day. Following is some of our "chat". </p>
<p>... "it has been nice for us to hang out here just with Mirei for a week."</p>
<p>... "she is an absolute joy... reminds me of Gram more and more with the twinkle in her eye and big smiles." </p>
<p>Mirei has a new high chair, one from IKEA, as "she's sitting with confidence now." and "We can leave her to sit but have to put some pillows behind her in case she topples." </p>
<p>"Mirei laughs with her entire body... just hilarious to watch!"</p>
<p>Riku mentions his sister a lot; it's interesting to hear how often he brings her name up. He said yesterday he wants to hold her, and he always mentions her name first when we talk about going home. He is such a good little brother to her...</p>
