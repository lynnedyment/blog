								<h2>A Morning with Amelia and Riku, and Tub Time with Mirei</h2>
								<p>Bryn dropped Riku off on his way to work yesterday, who got to see just fifteen minutes of Caillou, one of his favourite book characters, and then we came downstairs for some drawing time before Amelia arrived with Kevin at 9:30. They were delighted to see each other and played so well together for the entire morning. They started off at their little table in the kitchen, and it was fun to hear them sounding like little adults. "Would you like to use the blue colour?" and "No thanks; I am using this one." right up to apologies if one bumped into the other, with the response being, "Oh, that's okay." They played upstairs with the Lego, and when I went up to check on them, they had built a huge building with a tower. </p>
<p>Both of them needed some running-around time, so off we went to the playground at 10:45. Sam was there, a little girl Amelia met two weeks ago, but for the most part they all just ran around, climbing the play structures, hiding under them, and wearing themselves out for their naps. Riku asked me to be a witch, and so I went after them for a bit, cackling my best cackle, with Riku and Amelia screamiing and running faster and faster. We all got tired out, although Riku would have someone chase him the entire time and not be tired of it. </p>
<p>Home for lunch; they sat at the big table with their own placemats, lighthouses for Riku and sea creatures for Amelia, talking about them and behaving ever so nicely. They had time for some more upstairs playing before Kevin arrived for Amelia at 1:30. I wonder if she managed to get home without falling asleep; she was a tired girl, after her late bedtime after arriving home last night. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep by 1:40 (after "just two minutes and I will go right to bed!"... and he did) and slept for two solid hours. I got all the ironing done and had time for a cup of tea and some sorting/reading at the table. I went in at the two-hour point, turned off the sound machine, and kept the door open so he could hear household sounds. He always likes to be cuddled and coaxed into waking up, even when he awakens on his own. How I love this snuggly time with him, as I'm sure it won't be going on too much longer. I talked to him about one day being a big grown-up man like his Daddy and Grandpa, and how I would be much older and he wouldn't even remember the days when we used to snuggle and cuddle and sing together. I know it will be with him forever, tucked away in his very being, but not as part of his consciousness. </p>
<p>Once he roused enough to join the world again, he decided it was time for a treat from his Easter basket, and chose three thin-shelled "eggs". Grapes and six-year-old cheddar were his afternoon snacks, and then we were off in the yard, sweeping and collecting sticks for quite a long time. </p>
<p>Back into the house we came, when the wind picked up and it was getting cooler. I was vacuuming on this level, when Riku told Doug that his "studio" was a big mess; we cleaned it up together, deciding what could be thrown out, what drawings should be hung up, and putting all the markers and coloured pencils in their proper places. Riku likes things to be neat and orderly, just as Bryn did from this age on, and Riku was very happy with the results of our tidying time. "There! That looks better!" </p>
<p>Bryn was later at the office than either of us expected him to be, so at 6:30 we were downstairs with the box of sidewalk chalk and his tricycle, so Riku would be right there for pickup. Bryn is always anxious to get home too, and it's easier if we are already downstairs with shoes on waiting for him. We spent fifteen minutes making pictures on the sidewalk, and Riku peddled around now and then. Interesting that when we went downstairs into the full sunlight the first thing Riku said was, "Let's find a shady place." Just like his parents and his Grandpa, Riku prefers to be out of the sun. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn had given Doug a gift certificate to "Cafe Gratitude", a vegan and mostly "live" (i.e., uncooked) foods cafe in the Mission District. It was the first visit for us to this very popular spot so close to home, and it won't be our last. I really liked it so much, and now want to try everything on their menu. It was hard for me to decide what to order tonight, and I couldn't have been happier with it. All the foods are named after an emotional statement or feeling, which was fun, as the servers named them as they put them in front of us. "I Am Bountiful" started us off: "live bruschetta (meaning the "bread" is uncooked)... Four slices of our live toast topped with fresh tomatoes, basil, garlic, stone ground olive oil and brazil nut parmesan." Yummy... garlicky and oh-so-delicious with really wonderful tasty tomatoes, and lots of it. Doug was presented with his entree "I Am Honouring"... chipotle and sunflower seed "refried beans" with guacamole, salsa, and cashew sour cream on a bed of mixed greens. Topped with Brazil nut parmesan and our live flax chips." He ate every bite of it, even though he said it was filling enough, especially after the appetizer, that he could have stopped half way through it... too good to, though! I had a "warm grain" bowl presented as "I Am Graceful" made up of steamed quinoa with fresh basil-almond pesto, organic tomatoes, sprouts, and Brazil nut pesto. I cannot tell you how many times during the meal I moaned and said that it was so good; it was just amazingly tasty! Mine too was filling, and I saved half of it for tomorrow's lunch; can't wait! We still have slightly less than a half of the certificate left, so we'll be going back for an entree and shared dessert next time. I know this sounds pretty flaky California... and is some ways it is... Doug felt like saying "I am Not Amused", but the food was so good and the super friendly service was perfectly fine with me; much better than a surly waitperson as far as I am concerned. </p>
<p>It is a casual friendly spot; we shared a table with three others at the beginning of the meal. The fellow poured water for us and one of the three told me what she had eaten and what she had had there in the past. The waitresses were super-friendly, the staff were very huggy-touchy-feely with each other, broke into song at one point, and had a "question of the day" which staff and customers were free to answer if they chose. The question today: "What do you feel you have contributed to make the world a better place?" </p>
<p>We had been home for about an hour when Bryn IMed asking if I would like to give Mirei a bath. Would I?! I haven't given her one bath yet; she baths at home in the sink, and I was more than ready to have her splashing about in the tub, playing with the tub toys Riku played with at her age, and seeing that chubby little body of hers. Bryn had told me she likes her bath and does she ever! She was just grinning away, loving the water pouring out of the faucet, going on her tummy, lying back on my hands, being moved over the water, but mostly going after the small rubber ducks and the twirling tub toys from Gail and Tom many years ago. She is so funny... when she is excited about something, her whole body shakes and shivers as though she is cold. I could make it happen every time by swirling one of two toys for her. I washed her hair, bundled her up in the warm towels, and massaged her with Aveeno. By the end of it, she was one very tired baby. Bryn bundled her up for the stroller ride home and told me she was asleep before his second wave to me at the window, and continued to sleep in the house, still in her stroller. Yay, team! </p>
<p>I did a little emailing, and went upstairs to watch some Oprah tapes, just to veg' out and put my feet up. Doug was surprised to find me still awake at midnight, but I was awake until almost 1:30. I may be sorry in the morning, but what a fun day this was.</p>
