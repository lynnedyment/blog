								<h2>San Francisco to Cupertino to Ocean Beach</h2>
								<p>I slept in later than I thought I would, wrote a quick group email to my sisters, and then had to really dash into the shower to get out of the house on time. Made up cold and hot snacks and lunch for Riku, grabbed a half bagel with peanut butter for my breakfast, and was out the door at 8:45 as planned. Whew! </p>
<p>Riku was very interested in everything he could see out the car window today; he commented on the trees, the flocks of birds, the cows on the hills, and the big tractor-trailers we passed on the way to Ellen's. We arrived right at 9:45 and Ellen was there with her big smile to greet us. Riku made himself at home immediately! </p>
<p>We went outside, as Skippy (their little dog) was waiting for someone to throw balls to him. Riku obliged happily, and was delighted to see her jump into the pool after them. Lindsay came out with her suit on, and they had the best hour splashing each other, playing with Skippy, tossing a big ball between them, and just having fun. Lindsay is great with children, and Riku took to her immediately. He said "I 'member her!" and it's because her photo is on the fridge and I always tell him he has seen her at her house. That was two years ago, I think, but still he thinks he remembers her. </p>
<p>Ellen pulled out some of the girls' toys, so Riku had some inside fun too. There was the Fisher-Price farm, a newer version of the one we have, a peg game, a doctor's kit, which is a tad superior to the one we bought him, and best of all, a small battery-driven air hockey game. Riku adored it and played it with all three of us. </p>
<p>About a half hour before we were leaving to have lunch with friends of Ellen's, Lindsay's sweet boyfriend came by. Well, then Riku was really in his element: two "big kids" to play with! They had such fun. They chased him around the house, pretending to be monsters; Riku got to chase them and even got to doctor them too, giving needles and checking out their reflexes with the "hammer". They were just wonderful with Riku, and exhausted by the time we finally left for lunch. </p>
<p>We were meeting up with Victoria, whom I have known for years, plus a newcomer to their circle: an 88 year old widow called Grace. She introduced herself to them at their regular bakery/coffee/tea shop about six months ago, and has been lunching with them almost every Wednesday since. Riku went into the bakery first, where Judy, the owner, remembered him from our last visit; he got to choose a free cookie, one covered with lots of coloured circles, and I bought him a glass of fresh strawberry juice, mixed with just a little bit of honey. Riku sat and visited with them all at an outside table while I went off to buy a notebook and some pencil crayons, the one thing I forgot in my dash out the door. When I got back, Victoria and Grace told me how he had corrected their pronunciation of his name, just as he had in Nanaimo. "My name is not Riko! It is Riku, but this time he spelled it out for them. They were very impressed! </p>
<p>We had lunch at a Japanese restaurant next door, and it was just the nicest lunch. Riku sat and drew what everyone guessed was a whale, laughed at his little jokes ("This is <strong>not</strong> a whale! It is a cat and dog!"), and were astounded when he asked if he could have some sashimi... raw tuna, which he spotted on Grace's plate. She was having it for the first time in her life, and was delighted to let him have all the rest of it! I had a big plate of vegetable tempura, which Grace said she will have the next time; Riku ate some noodle and vegetable soup I had taken along, as well as a big container of strawberries and nectarines. Victoria was so taken with Riku, and kept saying his name with a real trill, in her South American accent, trying to get Riku to do it as well. She can't wait to be a grandmother! </p>
<p>I stopped in at the bakery as Judy and her husband also make Japanese and Chinese treats, savoury and sweet. Akane is very fond of them, and thinks they are a very good quality, much like the ones she enjoyed for lunches as a schoolgirl. I always take home a selection of them for her, and once again she was delighted with all of them. </p>
<p>We said our goodbyes, but had time for a quick photo first with all but Victoria, who had left early for a doctor's appointment. Riku was a tired little fellow by this time... full tummy, lots of exercise, and lots of stimulation from all the new people in his life. We drove home, Ellen asked if he would like to borrow the hockey game, and a happy little boy waved goodbye. However, just as we were leaving, Ellen was holding him for a hug, and asked him if he would like to stay with her. He willingly agreed and was ready to wave goodbye to me! Gee, guess he really had a great time! We'll be back. </p>
<p>Riku napped for only forty-five minutes; I know he was still tired but I didn't encourage him to go back to sleep by continuing to drive. Instead we stopped at a windy Ocean Beach, although I didn't expect to stay. Riku does not like the wind at all (he's like his Auntie Kelly that way), but he was fine with it this time. We sat in the sand and dug holes; he found lots of treasures... strings, a cord from a headset, and some rocks, and was a very happy boy for the whole hour and fifteen minutes we spent there. I stopped in at the Beach Chalet to use the washroom which Riku likes to do, as he gets to see the tiny overview of the area, with little trees, tiny houses, and lakes, etc. on display in the bottom of the "chalet". </p>
<p>At 5:30, we pulled up at Riku's home so he would have some time there with his sister and mom, but we caught them going out the door to run an errand. Riku was happy to have me go up to his room and check out the new Container Store storage for his toys; we sat and played UltraMen and monsters, he showed me lots of his DVDs, assuring me I would like them "this one is a little tiny bit scary but it's just pretend; it's okay, I will watch it with you" and then doing some building with interlocking plastic knobs. Akane was back with Mirei in just a half hour; she offered to cook a noodle dish for me to take home for dinner with Doug, and so I sat and played on the floor in Riku's room with both children for a half hour.</p>
<p>Mirei is sitting so well! She is very well balanced, and can lean forward to take her brother's toys now. He gave her hugs and kisses outside when we met them, and more inside too. When she got a little too close to his "art" work... a tower he had saved from another day, he ran to the living room and came back with a couple of her own toys to play with. I took a kajillion photos of the two of them and can't wait to see them. </p>
<p>Doug is still busy working crazy hours but the big deadline is tonight and then I should get two albums online; hope so anyway! We both thoroughly enjoyed the large portion of noodles Akane sent home with me, and I should have saved some for tomorrow... didn't though. Yum! </p>
<p>Tea, read, wrote a couple of emails, and the evening disappeared once more. Lights out at 12:30.</p>
