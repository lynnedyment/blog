								<h2><a href="/2006/08/my_little_travelling_companion.html">My Little Travelling Companion... SF to Nanaimo</a></h2>
								<p>Well, today was the big day; the very first trip alone together for Riku and me, but I hope not the last. We had a busy but relaxed morning at home, after Riku awoke at 7 A.M. His mommy, daddy, and sister came over to say goodbye about 8:15; we took a few photos of his smiling sister and waved (a foot!) out the window. Riku's and Bryn's current line is "Don't forget to put your fingers in your nose!" and so they both do, and laugh uproariously at themselves. </p>
<p>I put together a little picnic lunch for the plane, Akane had brought over inari for us as well, and the last minute packing was done in lots of time for our scheduled departure for the airport at 11:15. Grandpa stayed and waved goodbye to us while we went through the very long security line. </p>
<p>We wandered along the long hallway with a large display of seashells and ships in bottles, before heading for our gate, and found a seat near our plane so that we could watch our luggage being boarded before we did. Our time passed quickly here; Riku ate his second banana of the day and had some cheese and fruit. </p>
<p>We shared a seat with the father of a three and four year old, and he was amazed, as was I, that Riku was asleep ten minutes into the flight. He had a full tummy, lots to drink, and am empty bladder, all of which seemed to help do the trick. He just leaned against me, and slept well, while I read my book for an hour and twenty minutes, enjoying my tomato juice and pretzel snack.</p>
<p>Riku woke in time to see the plane about to begin the descent; I propped him up on a folded blanket and two pillows so he could see what was going on, and it made for a very happy boy. Our flight was from 1:05 until 3:05, a perfect time to be in the air I think. It took a long time for our bags to show up, but when we finally emerged Gail and Tom were there waiting for us. Big smiles all 'round!  </p>
<p>The drive to Tsawwassen seemed fast, although Riku must have asked ten times, between the terminals, if we could go on the boat now and play in the playroom we had told him about. So Uncle Tom took him to the little playground at the terminal while Gail and I finished up our sauteed tofu dinners (mine with rice), and a large cup of tea. </p>
<p>The playroom on board held Riku's interest for about fifteen minutes, and then he was happy to sit looking out the window at the tug boats and the islands (what gorgeous views we had!), exploring the ship with Uncle Tom, and just getting to know his Auntie Gail and Uncle Tom. He did a little drawing, looked at some books, but mostly wanted to wander about, even if it was just between all of us sitting there.  </p>
<p>It was a long day, and Riku was obviously tired by the time we reached the house just after 8:30 P.M. He spotted the new tub toys lining the big tub, and just had to have a bath; it seemed a good way to relax after a busy day and he had such a great time. The best of all possible things happened; we had told Riku he might see deer in Auntie Gail's and Uncle Tom's yard, and sure enough, just as I had him out of the tub and wrapped in a towel Gail called out two deer were on the front yard. How exciting this was for him, and they stood and watched together until they wandered across the road to the neighbours' place.</p>
<p>Gail and Tom had picked up several Robert Munsch books and did he ever laugh hard at "Aaron's Hair" when the runaway hair lands on someone's bottom! </p>
<p>His daddy called on Skype at 9 P.M., just as he was about to brush his teeth, and that done we went into his bedroom, complete with two stuffed lions on the bed. After one story, he was tucked in. Asleep at 9:30, too late... but he was happy right up to the end of his long day of travelling, and what a darling companion he was too! </p>
<p>Gail and I played cards, had tea, and then we all turned in before 11 P.M.; they had both been up early for hospital tests for Tom at 8 A.M. today and I have had a busy couple of days too.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/trains_and_a_dinner_party.html">Trains and a Dinner Party</a></h2>
								<p>Riku had been talking about our train ride for a few days, as I had told him all about it. It was only an hour long, and went from Nanaimo to Qualicum Beach, but with views of the water and the "forest". We arrived early and had lots of time to run around outside the station with Riku urging all three of us to get "on your mark, get set, GO!", and racing to beat us. Gail and I each made him a little ghost out of a tissue as well, tying the necks with some long weeds. They worked well and provided a little diversion while we waited for the 10:40 train. Within ten minutes of getting on, Riku was lulled to sleep by the motion of the train. I was very surprised, as he had slept well and didn't awaken until just after 7 A.M. </p>
<p>Jody and Hal were at the station to greet us, and Jody had a lovely little "treasure box" for him. He really liked it a lot and by the end of the day it already contained some interesting bits and pieces. Tom had driven there to meet us, and we all walked into Qualicum Beach to check out the Don Thompson folk art pieces. The store has interesting and varied works by many artists and I liked so much of it. In fact, I spotted a metal "Scottie" that I thought Jody would really like. She did, and I bought it for her and Hal as a very belated wedding gift. Then I thought what a perfect wedding gift one of Don Thompson's animals would make for Susan and Kevin; I had pretty much decided on a sweet puppy and bone, in a reclining position, but then spotted a gorgeous standing black and white dog named "Ranger" who just looked the perfect fit for the Doering/Ellis family. He's now standing guard in Gail and Tom's living room and is just wonderful. </p>
<p>A picnic lunch at Parksville was next on the agenda. It was a little cooler than we hoped it would be, although the sun was shining. Riku was tired, and we decided to forego the promised beach time until tomorrow morning, so he would have a longer time to play. </p>
<p>He entertained us all the way home by singing many songs to us, in both Japanese and in English. Riku really loves to sing, and the songs come from his heart; to hear him sing "Ten Little Ducks" is just the sweetest thing, as he gets sad and weepy sounding when they all have disappeared and then is so joyful when they all come back! </p>
<p>Once home and after his story, it was pretty obvious he wasn't going to nap at all. I guess the thirty-five minutes this morning made that impossible, so after a bit I decided it made more sense for him to have an earlier night tonight. So, up we got and the rest of the afternoon passed by quickly. We sat together and watched part of "Shrek 2", which he had spotted in our bedroom last night. Then, since Gail and I were playing cards for a bit, he decided he wanted to play too. We played a very simple version of "Go Fish", basically just trying to match up the cards that were turned over on the floor, and ended up throwing handsful up in the air. He had so much fun doing this, and now they are all carefully hidden under the sofa, where he stashed them. Bubbles outside on the deck, followed by helping Auntie Gail water the plants on the deck and then downstairs in the garden. He really loved doing this with her, and then she walked him across the street to meet Marilyn, owner of "Comet", Gail and Tom's surrogate dog. </p>
<p>Riku had a big plate of a two-egg mushroom and spinach omelette earlier, followed less than two hours later by a plate of strawberries, cheese, and more veggie "bacon", which he ate earlier as well. </p>
<p>At six P.M. we all went next door to the neighbour's for a cul-de-sac party consisting of four families with a grand total of twelve people, all adults except Riku. He was just wonderful! He told everyone his name when they asked and then asked what their names were. He chatted with everyone, showed each one his new treasure box and the contents but asked them not to take anything out. Gail took the bubbles over, so that kept him busy for a while as well, and Gail and I took turns going down to the garden with him. The biggest excitement of all was the appearance of two deer again tonight! He and I stood and watched them while they nibbled at the flowers and finally disappeared into the ravine behind their house. After having snacked on cheese and crackers, Riku ate chicken, corn on the cob, and several small glasses of milk. He was very comfortable asking for things he wanted, and Susan, our host, was just wonderful with him. Riku sat drawing at the table while we ate. When we left all the women commented on what a well mannered and good little boy he was; he said thank you and goodbye to them all as we left for tub time. </p>
<p>While he was playing in the tub, I told him how proud I was of his behaviour. Riku liked the idea of a party and obviously enjoyed it very much; what a sociable little fellow he is! </p>
<p>And of course he was a tired boy after this long day. He had a quick tub, another Robert Munsch book, and was asleep in less than seven minutes. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom just came home and said everyone, including the men, told them how wonderful Riku had been, especially without another child to interact with him. I agree totally... and would have added, "and tired too!"</p>
<p>Time for tea and cards, and my pots de creme; we have saved Riku's for tomorrow, after naptime. They were a huge hit, not surprisingly.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/beach_and_playground_day.html">Beach and Playground Day</a></h2>
								<p>Well, our wonderful streak of good weather continues for this trip as well, without the high temps, but with the sun shining and blue skies. Lucky us! Tom had to take his Mom to the doctor today so dropped us at Swyalana Lagoon, along the seawall in Nanaimo. It is a sheltered little beach, and at 9:30 in the morning was deserted as well. A couple of other children were there a little later on, but Riku kept himself happy with the sand toys Gail and Tom had bought for him, and a few trips to the water's edge for sand castle building too. </p>
<p>This is just the life for Riku; lots of space to wander about, and as much sand as he requires for all the things he likes to do: building with Nana and finding "treasures"... feathers, stones, shells, and of course sticks, which Auntie Gail put in the big bucket for him. </p>
<p>Comet, the neighbour's dog, was over for a visit today; he came to the beach too, and Gail took him for a long walk and then they sat on the wall behind us when Comet was ready for a rest. </p>
<p>Tom came by at 10:30 to see if we were ready to leave, and since we weren't, he took Comet home with him. Riku his lunch on the beach, and we gathered up the toys for our meeting with Tom at noon hour. There was just enough time for me to buy Riku his first (by me anyway) vanilla ice cream on a stick, covered with chocolate. He enjoyed every bite of it! </p>
<p>What a hard time he had keeping his eyes open for the seven-minute ride home. I got him right into bed and he slept for an hour and twenty minutes; not quite long enough perhaps, but he played happily on the deck, did some drawing, had snacks on the deck with me, and watched "Winnie the Pooh" while Gail and I did a little computer work beside him in the office. I sat with him and watched a bit too; Gail is a big Pooh fan as well, so we all enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Riku had fun following Comet around, kissing him on the back, and apologizing to him if he bumped into him. He is very gentle with him, and cooed away at him all day long. Riku and I played cards on the floor, finding the kings and queens, and finally just having "card rain" which meant throwing them all up in the air and letting them fall down over and around us. The afternoon passed quickly.</p>
<p>Gail cooked a wonderful dinner of grilled salmon, corn on the cob, and a big plate of raw veggies; we had it early so that we could head off to the Maffeo-Sutton park, near the beach we went to this morning. It is a huge and wonderful playground and perfect except for the stones on the ground, which got into all of our sandals... Gail's, mine, and Riku's. Gail finally gave up and sat on a bench with Tom; Riku didn't seem to mind much, as he spent most of his time up on the wooden structures, and I learned to pick my feet up high, which seemed to help. Riku had a great time, climbing up a high dome, and trying out things he normally would pass by. He ended up his hour here by picking up as many sticks as he could carry; we managed to find a good "hiding" place for them before leaving, and we might get back to find them another day. </p>
<p>Home for tub time, a nice relaxing end to his day. Auntie Gail read "Alexander the Wind-Up Mouse" to Riku, and then I tucked him in. Card and tea time followed, and then Gail and I got to work on the computer, working on the Lee side of the family. We don't have much down for them, but discovered another sibling we didn't know about, and learned that our great-grandfather Lee was not married to Parnell as Mom had always believed, but a Pownall. We could see how easily this could have been misheard over all the years, and discovered some birth dates for their family of six children, born in the late 1800s. Still a mystery... was she the first or second wife, as we know one of them died giving birth to our grandfather. More to explore as soon as we have time. </p>
<p>Bedtime at 11 P.M. for me...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/a_beach_morning_a_visit_and_a.html">A Beach Morning, a Visit, and a New Playground</a></h2>
								<p>What a life this is... up earlier than usual this morning, at 6:30, but the time flew by. Riku had a big fruit plate as usual, and finished off with a bowl of bran buds. We were amazed that he liked them but he said they were "just like granola". Off to the beach at 9:30, as Tom had to take his mom to the doctor again. </p>
<p>It was much hotter there today; Riku had the beach to himself once more, until an eleven-year-old boy named Jan, from South Carolina, visiting his grandparents, joined him. They had such a good time, fetching water, and creating a nice village of sand castles; Jan was a great companion and we were sorry when it was time for him to leave. Riku and I continued building more castles, and he wasn't too happy when it was time to leave at 11:30. I didn't want him falling asleep in the car, however, so we sang all the way home. This worked; he reminded me of a song I hadn't heard for years using both hands and fingers. The refrain is, "How are you this morning? Very well I thank you." and it kept Riku happy singing until we reached Galiano Drive. </p>
<p>Gail, Riku, and I ate outside on the little front deck; a lovely plate of assorted goodies for the adults... hummous, olives, a slice of homemade bread, and the end of Akane's inari. Riku ate a big lunch... a scrambled egg, the rest of Auntie Gail's homemade toast, 3/4 of an inari, and a container of yogurt, before tucking in at 12:30. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom went out for a few groceries; I tidied up the kitchen, made tea, answered a couple of emails, and set cards ready to go on the table. We had three games, many cups of delicious tea; Gail bought a light cream for a dish but knew she wouldn't use it all. We are having vanilla tea and with the cream, we just purr happily away. </p>
<p>Riku awoke a happy boy, running about on the deck, being silly and playing with Auntie Gail. He was hungry again and asked for fruit, which he ate while we sat and chatted together on the front deck again. He loves being able to go to one of two decks. Yesterday he told me it was very quiet in Nanaimo, and ended his comment by saying, "This was a good day, huh?", with which I agreed wholeheartedly. </p>
<p>Off to visit with Etta, Tom's mom, at 3:30. What a diplomatic little socializer Riku was! We were all amazed by him, as after greeting Etta with a big hug (she is Uncle Tom's mom, after all!), he then went around the main room saying hello to all the dear souls in their wheelchairs, holding the hands of those who wanted to touch him, and even leaning forward for one of them so she could touch his hair. They asked questions and he answered them, often filling in the conversation with statements such as his daddy, mommy, and sister being in San Francisco, and telling everyone I was his Nana. Today at the beach he told someone we were his Nanas, pointing to Gail and me. Gail was delighted. Needless to say, he was a hit, and those of the residents who were fine mentally smiled away at him and waited for another visit. He obliged by going over to show them how he could blow bubbles in his cup of water. Etta delighted him by pretending to be frightened by this, and he laughed and laughed each time she did it. </p>
<p>By 4:30 he was ready for some action, so off we went to Beban Park to a new playground. This was a great place, despite the loose gravel on the ground, obviously the favoured cover around here. We are spoiled in SF with our nice cushy comfortable bases on so many playgrounds. Riku must have climbed up the "rock" wall and gone down the tunnel slide about thirty times this afternoon! He was just tearing around, but not until after "Dr. Dyment" had made Gail and I his "patients", giving us both "horrible medicine but you have to take it", and making us lie down in the hospital "beds", most uncomfortable, and not built for more than large children. What a riot we had, laughing so hard and taking lots of photos of each other, after the "helicopter crashes" and trips to the hospital. This was just the grandest afternoon! </p>
<p>I popped Riku into the tub, feeding him "some food" while in there, as he was obviously far too hungry to wait fifteen minutes for dinner. He had Canadian cheddar cheese and a half-dozen grapes while playing with his animals, and then ate a whole piece of grilled salmon ("Hey! this is salmon!"), a half cob of buttered corn, and brown rice (two helpings), plus steamed broccoli. </p>
<p>He and I went out on the back deck and kept ourselves busy while Gail and Tom cleared up the dinner dishes. We blew bubbles, did a puzzle in jiffy time (Riku, that is!), and swept the deck. Riku went over with Uncle Tom to get Comet, so Riku could play with him for a while and he introduced him to a new "dog" of AG's and UT's. Comet was not impressed but did stay outside while Riku finished every bite of his dinner, hoping for something to drop. </p>
<p>Then Riku helped Auntie Gail water the garden at the front; he does a good job at it, taking it seriously and making sure every flower gets a good soaking. He was working on a second puzzle to show UT how he does them so quickly, but he was obviously tired, as he could barely concentrate. Daddy called through on Skype just as it was tuck-in time, but he was still hungry, and had a banana and a whole tub of yogurt. I don't know where he's putting it, but he has gained a full pound since arriving here. All this fresh air and running around makes for one hungry boy! </p>
<p>He chatted with his parents and really wanted to hear Mirei talk; at one point he said he wanted to touch her, and had a big smile break out when he heard her voice. Bryn told us she is now crawling backwards! Wow! </p>
<p>Auntie Gail read him his current favourite book, a Robert Munsch, where hair runs and holds onto a bottom(!), and I just smiled and smiled as I heard that big uproarious laughter at his favourite part. </p>
<p>Asleep in less than five minutes after I started singing to him... this was such a wonderful day with him, and I know he had a fabulous time. He said again tonight on the deck, "This was a fun day, huh?", just as he did earlier, and tonight in the bathroom while brushing his teeth, he said "Nanaimo is a nice place. I would like to live here." I have never heard comments about our days or places like this before, although I know that Bryn often asks him if he had a fun day. Nice to hear Riku commenting about his feelings.  </p>
<p>Another interesting thing is that Riku will often tell you why he was "angry" and in the bathroom told me he was a "little bit angry today at the beach, so I broke the castles." I told him that was okay because they were his castles, but he really wanted to let me know he was angry when he did it. </p>
<p>Cards, tea, and an early night for us; Gail was up far too early this morning, at 5 o'clock, and I am ready to sit and read for a while.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/robert_munsch_a_hit.html">Robert Munsch... a Hit!</a></h2>
								<p>Off to Chemainus this morning at 9:30, after a lovely start to our day, with Riku drawing on the deck, keeping busy with his books, and wandering about this floor of the house. Tom had booked tickets for at the theatre in Chemainus before we arrived, so we stopped there first to get our hands stamped, before the crowds arrived. Riku wanted one on each hand, and they kindly obliged. </p>
<p>As a child, Tom had gone to "Billy's" for ice cream and we had promised Riku some before the play. He tasted chocolate and strawberry before deciding on the latter, and Auntie Gail bought it for him. He asked for a cup, which suprised me, and Gail and I could not resist a plate of french fries to share. Riku had some too. </p>
<p>We could see crowds of people heading to the theatre well before the doors opened, and so were not first in line by any means. However, we were lucky enough to get second row seats, which put us close enough to the stage that Riku had a great view of all the action. What a time he had! He laughed and howled and even called out a couple of times to the four wonderful young actors, who made it a point to make eye contact during all six of the short stories. Of course, the big hit was "The Paper Bag Princess", the only story Riku recognized. Thank goodness Gail had it on hand downstairs, as I read it to him on the way there and in the theatre while we waited for the lights to dim. The dragon was terrific, although the cast played it all so over the top that all the children were just delighted with it. A hit for sure! The cast came outside after the performance and Riku had a chance to say hello to all of them and get his photo with them as well. </p>
<p>Before leaving Chemainus, we stopped to take a photo of a beautiful home with a wonderful children's cottage in the front yard. Riku was intrigued and would have loved to have knocked on the big rounded door, straight out of a fairy tale. There are some lovely homes in this town; might be worth having a look around to see about prices for retiring here. The beach is right at the end of the road too! </p>
<p>Riku must be going through a big growth spurt, as I can't keep enough food going into him lately! He had a huge breakfast before we left the house... a full fruit plate, consisting of a whole banana, half a dozen big strawberries, and grapes. Three slices of veggie "bacon" followed, plus Gail's toasted homemade bread, and finally a bowl of bran buds, which are very filling. The minute we were in the car for the trip home, he asked for food, and thank goodness I had scrambled two eggs for the cooler, and had juice and WW crackers, and fish crackers too. This managed to keep him awake for the half-hour trip home; thank goodness, as he was a tired boy and slept from 1:15 to 3 P.M. </p>
<p>Gail and I played cards, had our tea, and then spent a little time on the computer with our continuing family research. We are now looking for the maiden name of our maternal grandmother's mother, not easy when her married name was Mary Lee. There are hundreds of them! </p>
<p>Once Riku was awake, we had snacks outside on the deck, did more drawing (Auntie Gail really really wants to keep this latest drawing of his, but Riku insists he has to show it to Mirei, and his parents). It's lovely, and looks like a stained glass window. </p>
<p>Gail and I did lots of running around on the deck with Riku, all of us shrieking at the various witches and monsters, who changed faces many times over. Riku always likes there to be one person who can "rescue me!" when the enemy comes too close. Ice cream on a stick was a nice treat for him after his nap, but he also filled up with yogurt and stawberries.</p>
<p>Once it got too hot on the deck, we came in to the computer room. Riku watched "Stuart Little", the first time I believe he has seen it, and a first for me too. The fan was going, Riku was still in his underwear from his nap, and life was good. Gail was scrolling for more clues, and in between possible "sightings", I sat with Riku and enjoyed the movie very much as well. Riku had lots of questions about what was happening, and it was fun for both of us to have company while watching this sweet film. At one point Gail found a new "hit" and I came in and printed up the 1881 England Census form for Mary Lee, born in 1857; Mary was married to William Lee and they are the parents of our Mom's dad, Henry Lee. </p>
<p>We had a simple dinner tonight... grilled veggie "dogs"; it was too hot to cook anyway, and too hot for the adults to eat much. I cooked mac' and cheese for Riku with tomato and mushrooms, and a half cob of corn. He ate every single bite, plus another slice of Gai's bread and lots of milk. As soon as dinner was over, Gail, Riku (in his Hawaiian shorts and tops... almost too small for him now but still cool!) walked over to a nearby playground; it's old and not too exciting, but Riku climbed up on the wooden structure for a bit, slid down the slide a few times. Mostly, though, he wanted Gail and me to be monsters, and witches, and action figures and take turns chasing each other. Of course there were some sticks for collecting, and a tunnel to explore, and Riku's cheeks were pink with the heat and the running by the time we headed home for a cool bath. </p>
<p>I let him sit and play for a longer time tonight, just to relax and cool down. He could sit for an hour interacting with all the animals, but he wanted to draw for a bit too, and did a puzzle with Uncle Tom looking on. Bed time at 8:10. Sleep came hard tonight, though, as the room was very hot, and Riku just will not sleep without a top on; it was too warm, however, and so I waited patiently while he scratched, and wiggled, and drank water, went to the bathroom an extra time (lots of fluid today!), and asked questions. Man oh man, I was more than ready for my tea when those eyes finally shut! </p>
<p>I called Jody about lunch arrangements on Monday, and had talked with Judi earlier in the day. Sat on the cool dark deck with Gail and Tom for a half hour, before coming in for cards and bed at 11 P.M., but had a little Skype exchange with Bryn before calling it a day. Following is some of our "chat". </p>
<p>... "it has been nice for us to hang out here just with Mirei for a week."</p>
<p>... "she is an absolute joy... reminds me of Gram more and more with the twinkle in her eye and big smiles." </p>
<p>Mirei has a new high chair, one from IKEA, as "she's sitting with confidence now." and "We can leave her to sit but have to put some pillows behind her in case she topples." </p>
<p>"Mirei laughs with her entire body... just hilarious to watch!"</p>
<p>Riku mentions his sister a lot; it's interesting to hear how often he brings her name up. He said yesterday he wants to hold her, and he always mentions her name first when we talk about going home. He is such a good little brother to her...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/a_cannon_and_a_water_park.html">A Cannon and a Water Park!</a></h2>
								<p>Today was a red-letter day for Riku; I think this was the best day of five great ones so far. This morning, after the usual big breakfast, some quiet drawing, time, and a much anticipated visit with Comet, we went off to the playground near the seawall. Riku ran about happily from one activity to another; it was hot here today and we were happy to seek shade in the park when he had to get to a bathroom. He found a great tree he could step inside and spent lots of time in his "bear cave". Tom had walked Comet, who wasn't any more interested in exercising in the heat than the adults, so we sat on the rocks and watched Riku beating off the bears. </p>
<p>Anticipating the cannon being shot off at noon hour, we set off to walk along the seawall to the main area closer to downtown. Gail took Riku off down a dock, and this was wonderful for him. He got to see boats up close, the sea planes docked right there, a few taking off, and a long extended dock area to explore. We arrived at the cannon just as they were preparing to go through all the steps; Riku was well prepared for them, having had "Drummer Hoff" read to him several times over the past month or so. This was just perfect; he saw the shot being placed, and the long rammer pushing it in, heard the order to fire, and then KABBOOOOM!, just like in the book! He was smiling from one ear to another as Gail held him. I got at least two great photos I hope, and Gail took one of Riku and me standing near the cannon with Riku having a good look at the two of them. </p>
<p>Home for lunch, more drawing, and then naptime; he was asleep in just minutes, before I finished singing "The Wheels on the Bus". Gail and I had one game of cards, and then she and Tom went off to Costco; I had some quiet time on my own, just reading and relaxing with a second cuppa.</p>
<p>Riku napped for what I feel is the perfect nap time for him; from 1-2:30, waking a happy little boy and ready for the rest of his day. We hung around for a bit while he had his hearty snacks... vanilla yogurt with fresh strawberries, currently his very favourite fruit, and the rest of his toast from his morning snack. </p>
<p>We had planned to go to the big water park at Parksville today, but there was a big car event on, and there was no point in battling the traffic that was sure to be there. It couldn't have been better timing, as we ended up going to a park Tom used to frequent as a child, and is now a very well-planned neighbourhood water park. What a perfect place for Riku this was!</p>
<p>There are three hoses, with very good aiming ability, with a certain limited range. Three children were using them, and at first Riku seemed hesitant about getting wet. However, once he had his chance at a turn, and got wet the first time, he was gung ho about aiming and taking hits himself. I had a turn too, and Riku found one that worked even better than mine; I was soaking wet one minute after, as I was across from his perfect aim! Gail and Tom laughed so hard but I couldn't get Gail near it to try it out and get revenge. </p>
<p>Riku really enjoyed playing in the shallow warm water created by all the other fountain areas, and eventually three other children all joined ranks collecting small sticks to float down the streams. He was such a happy little fellow paddling about in the water, not at all minding the sharp stones that I didn't like one bit. I got a good second soaking by leaning over in front of the spouts of a clown while trying to turn it on. We spent an hour and a half at this wonderful spot, and I hope we will have time tomorrow to revisit it. One of the little boys, a four-year-old, kept dunking his hat in the cold water and putting it on his head. By the time we left, Riku had dunked his head under one of the fountain streams, and was dashing under one of the large "shower" areas, loving it all. </p>
<p>Home for a tub in Gail and Tom's "spa tub". A few days ago Gail turned the jets on to see if Riku would like it, but it was somewhat loud and the jets too vigourous for his liking, but now that he is the expert at water parks, the jets were just the next step to a new exciting experience. Not only did he slide down into the water so that the bubbles were flowing furiously, but he turned a dial that made it even more agitated! One more week here and he would be a child taking on lots of new challenges I think; even at the playgrounds he is getting bolder about tackling things he wouldn't have done last week in San Francisco; he has become a much more adventurous boy. Of course birthday number four is coming up and Riku is changing in many areas, and shall continue to do so of course. </p>
<p>His vocabulary is growing every day, by leaps and bounds, his confidence about talking to strangers is very impressive, and speaking up too! "My name isn't Riko! My name is Riku" is what he told the neighbour at the dinner party a few days ago. </p>
<p>He wants to know about everything: "What you talking about?" "What you talking about now?" and "What is protected?" he asked Gail tonight after she told him the paper protected his crayon from breaking. Nothing gets left unanswered or unquestioned these days. Today I overheard him telling Tom that some people have large nipples and some have small and "What kind of nipples you have?" "I have small ones, but I am little. One day I will be bigger and have big nipples." </p>
<p>While I was bathing Riku, Gail cooked a very tasty meal for the two of us... a stir fry with red and yellow peppers and sesame-topped tofu; I shouldn't have eaten it all, and could easily have saved half of it for tomorrow, but it was far too good to resist! </p>
<p>Riku had a little tofu, and a generous portion of his mac and cheese with fresh tomatoes, "bacon", and an orange and a banana half. He did some more coloring; a puzzle with Uncle Tom and a story with Auntie Gail finished off his day. He had a hard time falling asleep tonight though, which really surprised me; he was tired, relaxed, had a full tummy and was happy, but it was very hot in his room despite the fan, dogs were barking in the neighbourhood, children were playing nearby and he could hear them calling to each other, he had many spots to scratch, and a lot of questions to ask. Finally gave in at 9 P.M. an hour after would have been ideal. Ah well, I can well remember those hot Ontario nights as a child when I tossed and turned too, trying hard to drift off. It's bound to happen. </p>
<p>Gail and I made up lunch for tomorrow; Jody and Judi and possibly Taryn will be here with us for a few hours. More on that tomorrow... <br />
bedtime, after a wonderful day, at 11:40.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/lunch_with_friends_and_the_wat.html">Lunch with Friends and the Water Park</a></h2>
								<p>Today was a full and busy day, starting with a quiet morning at home with Riku. Usually we go off to a park or playground before lunch and naptime but Judi, Taryn, and Jody were invited for lunch, and so we opted for a less busy morning today. Riku watched Stuart Little 2, and liked it just as much as he did the first one. Once I was up and showered, I sat with Riku while he ate his fruit plate and watched the movie along with him. It's so much nicer to have company for this, as he has lots of questions about "What's happening?" and gets the answers. The voices of all the characters are just wonderful in these movies, and just as much fun for adults as children. They are, after all, Gail and Tom's movies!</p>
<p>Gail was busy getting a few things done in the house that have been neglected since our arrival. With our busy days out with Riku, the house needed a quick vacuuming, and a little dusting. Tom went out to  do a few errands, including some for me, and the first few hours flew by. Tom and I went down with Riku to meet Judi and Taryn, due in on the 10:30 ferry. Taryn looks wonderful; she looked fabulous at her wedding a year and a bit ago, but has lost forty pounds since then, and is as slim as can be. Marriage obviously agrees with her! Judi came bearing gifts as always, and this time some of my favourites: her homemade jam... blackberry and red currant. Yum! </p>
<p>Riku was a little shy with them, and had a little trouble sharing me too. He wanted me to stay in the living room with him, and not to talk with them. It took me longer than it should have to realize that, despite a full banana, a generous portion of strawberries, a good sized bowl of bran buds with milk, and a glass of milk on top of it all, that he was hungry! I can't keep him filled up this week! I scrambled two eggs and toasted a slice of Gail's bread, and within ten minutes he was his usual happy and sociable self. </p>
<p>He did the most amazing thing this morning. He had been colouring on his own in the living room, while I sat on the deck with Gail, Judi, and Taryn, and when I went in to give him his second breakfast he was arranging the markers into the letters of his name! He had already done the R and the I, and was just realizing that the ten he had wouldn't do for the last two letters. I got out his markers from home, and within minutes he had figured out how to make them using six more. I was astounded and he realized he had done something worth sharing with everyone; he got Taryn in to have a look at it, and she stayed inside with him and they worked at more letters. </p>
<p>Riku had also been working all week on a single drawing; it looked somewhat like a stained glass window. We were all flabbergasted at how carefully he worked away at it each day; Gail kept asking him if she could have it when he finished. Today he told her once again she couldn't; the reason? He had to show it to Mirei, and his mommy and his daddy. He was marking off large areas into various shapes, and then colouring each section in using different colours. Sometimes an area would be broken down into even smaller sections. Today he finished it! (Auntie Gail has stolen it away, but promised me she would give it back if he noticed it missing. She thinks she is going to be a wealthy woman one day when she sells this original art work by  John Riku Dyment.) I took photos of it in various stages, though, so we shall have a record of it. </p>
<p>Jody arrived a little later than she had hoped; she has a full house at the B&B this long weekend and had things to do before coming for lunch. We had some tea first, and then wine was poured just as she drove up. Gail had made a lovely mixed green salad with strawberries this morning, I made the maple syrup/oil and vinegar dressing. I made the crêpes the day before, while Gail made the mushroom filling. She baked it early to keep the heat down at noon hour, and the cheese sprinkled over the top, a wonderful Asiago, had Riku suggesting to Auntie Gail that she smelled! Gail had also put together a lovely plate of fresh tomatoes, basil, and tiny boccocini cheese, for a Caprese salad. Last night while I was tucking Riku in, she made six cups of delicious coconut custard; the entire lunch was a hit, and Judi suggested they all go to Gai's once a month for lunch. </p>
<p>I tucked Riku in and he napped while we had tea and custard, but awoke too early, just as Judi and Taryn were leaving for their ferry. There was time for a few group photos and a sleepy little fellow is leaning on my shoulders in them. </p>
<p>Jody stayed on for a little extra time, and brought the most beautiful summer dress for Mirei... for next summer or perhaps one more after that, and a darling little bedtime bear with a heat pack in it, both in soft perfect colours for Mirei. </p>
<p>We were waffling as to where to go with Riku; he needed to get out for some exercise, and I finally decided, because of the heat, that we would return to the water park. I am so glad we did, because it was the perfect final evening in Nanaimo for Riku. He took one look around, and after being told that I hadn't brought his swim trunks, decided he would just wear his underwear. And then, much to my surprise, he wanted his shirt off, just like another boy his age! </p>
<p>The sweet little boy who was there the day before was there again; there was another little boy, a fearless little guy, whom Riku spent lots of time with, and what a time he had! Tonight, the water hoses were familiar and even more fun for him; he got as much water sprayed on him as he sprayed on others (but not me tonight!), and because he kept his rubber sandals on, he was able to really run about, jumping and splashing in the puddles and streams. He also noticed his new-found friend dunking his hat in the water, and then putting it on, so Riku instantly did the same thing. He ran through the high fountains, got soaking wet, climbed the steep slide with no hesitation at all... what a big change within the past few weeks, and even this week! </p>
<p>We stayed long enough that he had cooled off completely and really was tired from the exertion of his busy hour plus there. Home for dinner, and a long tub. Even the tub was such a change for him tonight. Last night he realized when I was getting his PJs out that he hadn't taken the animals out of the tub. I told him I would do it later, but he insisted he had to tidy them up. Back he went in the cool tub and lined them all up beautifully. Tonight, before getting out of the tub, he took them out, lining them up of course on the edge, but then proceeded to clean the tub with a cloth. This was adorable; he asked for a dry cloth and started wiping down all the edges and ledges, doing such a good job on each area before starting in on another. Gail should hire him; that tub was just shining and dry by the time he finished up, even though I was trying to convince him that it looked great. He moved around on the floor of the tub so he could get at it all. While all this was going on he was chatting away to himself... shall try to capture some of it. "When I get big I will clean the walls, and get a ladder and clean the ceiling, and fix the lightbulbs (one had burned out), and wash the floor and clean up, and sweep the floors..." and on and on it went! </p>
<p>But the best part of all was seeing how much he enjoyed the action of the Jacuzzi jets. Last night he did sit down and enjoy it, but tonight the jets went on full right from the beginning, and after Gail showed him how to turn a dial to make it bubble up furiously, he did that, sitting and grinning away in the midst of the bubbling madness of fast churning water. Wow! He is going to miss this the most, I think. </p>
<p>Riku had a little trouble getting to sleep again tonight; it is still hot in his room, although not quite as much as last night. Once he was asleep, I packed up our suitcase, and then went down to help Gail and Tom pack up "Ranger" (the folk art dog) for the trip home. Tom had kindly scoured around town, on this holiday Monday, to find a box for Ranger, and bought bubble wrap to keep him safe. This took quite a long time, and we ended our day with a few games of cards, and tea... bed at 11 P.M.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/nanaimo_to_san_francisco.html">Nanaimo to San Francisco</a></h2>
								<p>Well, today is the day to head home again. It has been a lovely, busy fun-filled week with Gail and Tom, but all good things must come to an end. Riku slept in until 7:45 today; I had been lying there for a while but finally got up to shower and get the last-minute things packed up. Riku was a little out of sorts, with not quite enough sleep under his belt for such a busy morning. He sat and watched the first Stuart Little while eating a banana, his cereal, and apple juice. I finished the bit of packing, and put together a little extra food for him for the ferry: two scrambled eggs, toast, and an orange. Gail had packed up cheese, veggies, and fruit for us last night, but we both forgot to get it out of the fridge! </p>
<p>We left the house at 9:05, just five minutes later than planned. I had asked Tom to make the reservation for guaranteed loading on the 10:15 ferry out of Duke's Point, as things were filling up fast. We made it there in lots of time, and as soon as we were onboard Tom and I lined up for breakfast while Gail and Riku got seats in the dining area for us. When we returned with eggs, toast, hash browns, and tea, Riku was sitting happily working on a new picture, in reds and purple. </p>
<p>We sat there for quite a while and then Uncle Tom took him up on the top deck to see the water; it was far too windy today for him and for the next hour he was most happy playing in the play area with many other children. He drank an entire bottle of orange juice as he played and before we knew it we were landing. Riku was sound asleep two minutes after the car got moving, the half hour not nearly enough to make up for the lost hour last night. </p>
<p>We had a little time at the airport; I found a Vancouver t-shirt for Riku, went through to claim a GST refund, and the time before getting through the security area came too quickly. I had two full baggage carts, both quite heavy, and Riku insisted, once Gail and Tom had to say goodbye, on helping me push one of them, on his own! He pushed and  maneuvered to the best of his ability, but a very kind woman offered her assistance. Riku insisted on doing it on his own, but a little gentle guidance from her made the turns a little easier. At one point Riku allowed her to push it while he pulled it from the front; what a trooper! He really was a big help, and I would have had a lot more trouble if he hadn't been doing his best to help.  </p>
<p>Our flight was at 2:45; we got to the gate, after a bathroom stop, just as they were loading, but took the time for Riku to have one slide down in the children's play area. We could easily have put in a half hour there but without knowing about it, I tried to avoid just sitting around before the flight. </p>
<p>Off we went, with Riku handing in his ticket, being a little concerned that they didn't tear off the one end of it as I had told him they would, and then finally asking one of the attendents to do this. And, the best part of all was that he was invited to go into the cockpit and see all the lights and meet the captain and first officer! They lit up the lights for him, and were so wonderful with him; Riku was just grinning from ear to ear. </p>
<p>Riku had a window seat, I had the middle, and we had a very quiet man sitting on the aisle, working away with papers and reading a book. Riku has to be the perfect flight companion! He settled in immediately, got the seat belt on, listened to the announcements and asked questions about them, and once we were in the air took out the emergency instruction manual and sat "reading" it over very carefully several times. He pointed out to me that we couldn't smoke, couldn't take our luggage with us, and then asked about the little drawings of fire and water and the emergency ramp. Bryn told me they had gone over this on the flight to and from Japan as well, so he has it well memorized. The rest of the trip went amazingly well; Riku looked at books, he drew for a while with his markers, we talked about "old people with spots on their faces" (his visit to Etta's residence the other day obviously triggered this comment), and he sat on my lap and watched a bit of "Wallace and Grommet", although the lighting wasn't that good. When we first sat down he asked "Where is <strong>my</strong> TV?" and told me what he had watched on the trip from Japan... although I have forgotten now what it was. He liked it though! He had a glass of apple juice, ate a few goldfish crackers and was perfectly happy sitting there for the entire flight. We landed at 4:59 P.M., right on time. it was a long walk to the area where we were being met by his parents and sister, but the second he spotted them, I told him he could run ahead, and run he did... straight for Mirei! He was so excited to see her and by the time I got there he had given her several hugs and kisses, eliciting many smiles from others waiting for passengers. It was the sweetest thing, and Mirei just added to it with her big beaming smiles at us. </p>
<p>I sat on the floor with Mirei while Bryn looked after the luggage. Riku was bouncing back and forth from talking to Bryn, joining Akane and me, and continuing to kiss his sister and talk to her. Oh my! How he loves her and how he shows it too. He so obviously missed her. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped me at home at 5:40, just as Doug had left for his T'ai Chi class. I had an hour and a half on my own, got my carryon bag sorted out, checked my emails briefly -- too many to even think about right now -- and then called Gail's (leaving them a "thank you" message), and Uncle Frank, whom I had neglected while away. We chatted for a whole hour, and I waved at Doug when he came walking in with his dinner burrito. It was lovely catching up on Uncle Frank's news and there was lots of it; he has learned to make devilled eggs, has a new corn-on-the-cob holder and cooker, and is being kept busy with his physio. </p>
<p>The rest of the evening I deleted emails, did more unpacking, sat and read today's paper, and went off to bed at 11 o'clock. Doug had been working flat out all week so he was glad to get to bed before midnight for a change.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/badm_and_ocean_beach_the_party.html">BADM and Ocean Beach... the Party Continues!</a></h2>
								<p>Well, what a wonderful first day we had at home. It is hot and sunny here in San Francisco, and I hope it continues for a few days. If Susan, Kevin, and Amelia really did have ten days of rain and clouds in Alaska it would be wonderful if the sun shone here for them; they arrive home tomorrow night, and I am hoping for some fun morning outings with them! </p>
<p>I know there is lots to do here, especially since I am heading back east in fifteen days, but I just cannot stay in and work when Riku has these mornings available to do all the things we can't do when school is in. </p>
<p>Today felt like the first day of "summer vacation" here in the city, after our trip away. So I called to see if Riku could go off to the Bay Area Discovery Museum with me; Akane put him on the phone and he said "okay", but added that he was still in his pajamas, and was busy playing with something of Mommy's that was very special and he had to be careful. </p>
<p>I told Akane I would be there as close to 9 A.M. as I could get ready and off I went to shower, pull everything out of my big suitcase, write a quick email to my sisters, and put together lunch and snacks for Riku. I was there at 9:10 to pick him up. Mirei was in a darling pink short overall set, and looked oh so sweet! Those smiles; she truly does smile all the time! I was astounded at how much red I could see in her hair. We were able to see the redness in her eyebrows long ago, but this was the first time I saw this much red in her hair! Akane says it is even more noticeable outside in the sunlight; Bryn said later it was interesting that her eyes are darker than Riku's and her hair lighter, but if she ends up being a redhead... wow! </p>
<p>Riku snacked on some "Os" in the car.. "not the yucky kind; they are all gone. These are the good kind." We were over the Golden Gate Bridge and at the museum early enough that it was easy to find a spot, and off we went to the fish stream. It won't be long before Riku is too tall for this area, and today I just let him dictate how long we would spend at each spot. Usually, I am urging him to do more things, as we don't get there often, but I'm hoping to take advantage of the mornings and get there quite frequently, even if he is home for his naps. We talked about going to the zoo as well, as it's too late to go there after his nap after school time. Riku loves the water and the fish tumbling from one spot to another, but was equally happy "rebuilding" the wonderful outdoor little house made of twigs. I wasn't. It was just too hot in that area, although we spent a good half hour there. </p>
<p>A fellow placing stones around bedding areas overheard me telling Riku I was too warm, and he suggested we head to an area behind the boats with more shade and more sticks for building up the "nests". He enjoyed that just as much, and spent quite a bit of time there before heading off to his very favourite spot... the boat. There was quite a large group of children on it today, and before I knew it Riku was running down the ramp yelling, "The boat is sinking! The boat is sinking!", following the lead of one of the older children inside the boat. They all had each other calling out orders and running in and out, out and about, for ages. </p>
<p>We had our lunch indoors where it was a little cooler, and ate early enough that we found a table to ourselves. Riku once again ate a big meal... the scrambled egg I had taken along, half of my grilled cheese sandwich, a whole orange, and then most of a big container of fruit smoothie with four fruit juices. I told him he could have ten more minutes on the boat; I could see his eyes drooping and thought an early nap was in order. He was asleep in the car before I got to the bridge entrance, about five minutes from where we were. The windows were open, the car was cool, and I parked on The Great Highway, in a shady spot, while he napped for fory-five minutes. He awoke a happy boy and asked if we were at Ocean Beach; I had driven over there once his eyes opened anticipating his going back to sleep. However, he was ready to build, so we trooped down to the water's edge with all the buckets and equipment that fit in our big beach bag, and had a grand two hours there sitting on the beach with the occasional trip to the water to fill our pails for sandcastles and roads. </p>
<p>There was an older couple sitting on chairs not too far from us, and at one point Riku strolled over to them to say hello. He introduces himself now and tells them who I am "My name is Riku. What is your name? That is my grandma over there. Her name is Nana." and on it goes. They were lovely with him, and the man played a game on Riku's hand which ended with Riku's arm in the air and being tickled. He meandered over about five or six times so they could do it again and again. </p>
<p>At 3:30 Riku suddenly spoke up and said, "I want to go to my home now. I want to see Mirei." We had had a grand time together and this was the perfect time to head off; he said his goodbyes to the couple while I packed up, we dusted all the sand we could manage off him, and sang all the way home. I taught him a new song... "I love you, I love you, said the little green man..." and he wanted to know what "my wits" were. Try explaining that one! </p>
<p>Mirei and his mommy greeted him with big smiles and hugs, I washed his face and hands to get the last of the sand off the obvious places, held Mirei and got those big smiles too, and then headed home to get something done with the rest of my day. Bur first, time for a big cup of tea and the morning paper. Then I got back to the laundry, cleared random things away from the unpacking, and made dinner while Doug went off to Safeway. We had wild salmon, corn on the cob, carrots and celery, and I polished off a bowl of spinach from the freezer.</p>
<p>Bryn IM-ed at one point that Riku was helping Akane bath Mirei in the kitchen sink; he had pulled up a stool first in the bathroom to get her a tub toy. What a guy!  </p>
<p>Computer time for a while and then the doorbell rang. It was Mirei with her daddy, who had walked her over in the stroller while Akane put Riku to bed. Mirei was ready for her bed too, but we had time to snuggle on the sofa, and floor time too for quite a while before she let her daddy know she was ready for sleep. She looked lovely in a pair of pull-on flowered pink pants and a soft pink pullover top; the short sleeves showed off her muscular and chunky little arms.</p>
<p>Bed at 11 o'clock for me; I had fallen asleep before Doug came up at midnight with the news that a terrorist plot to blow up planes had been discovered in England and now no carry-on items are being allowed on board, including books! The only exception is medication... what a world we live in. It's why we have children; they give us hope for the future.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/cycling_riku_and_welcome_home.html">Cycling Riku, and Welcome Home Amelia!</a></h2>
								<p>I had the morning hours through 1 P.M. today to catch up on paper work and I made good use of my time. My "paper" basket was overflowing, and I spent three hours tackling that project, sorting and filing and making notes, and tossing. Still lots to do but I made a very good start at it, after deciding to delay the ironing for one more day. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped Riku off at 1 P.M. He had been home for lunch and Akane had decided it might be best for Riku to come for his nap and a playtime, rather than in the other order. It worked well for me, as I had a nice big chunk of time in the morning, when I am most likely to keep at it! He walked in saying "I want to have dessert before nap time" and so a bowl of his favourite custard was soon on the table. Riku is being so good about just accepting the amount of time he has to play before needing to nap; if I tell him five minutes, he is willing to just go along with that, although he will sometimes attempt to negotiate "just one more minute", or even two or three. Sometimes I agree, sometimes not. </p>
<p>Today he spent his five minutes in his "studio", going over everything on the table, but also told me that "Mirei was so messy today!" When I asked him why, he told me in great detail that she was eating "noli" and made a big mess... on her hands, all over her face, and around her mouth. I didn't understand what he said she was eating, but he did explain that it wasn't fish, or fruit, or vegetable. Turns out it was mashed nori, but he was saying it the way the Japanese pronounce it, and it was just different enough that I didn't understand it. Tomorrow I will have him tell me again, so that I recognize it the next time. </p>
<p>I forgot to mention the other day in Nanaimo that Riku told me, "My Mommy speaks a little bit of English, my Daddy speaks a little bit of Japanese, and I speak a little bit of English <strong>and</strong> a little bit of Japanese"! Doug commented today after hearing this, that the time is soon approaching when he will be better in both languages than his parents are in their second one. Mind blowing! </p>
<p>Riku was asleep in just a few minutes today and napped for an hour and a half. He was a little grumbly when he woke up, and actually dozed back to sleep for a few extra minutes once I went in to turn off the sound machine and open his door. He needed some cuddling time too, and was then ready to sit and build roads in the clay "table". Of course I always suspect that he is hungry when he is grumbly and it solved the problem once again... six-year-old cheddar cheese and thinly sliced apple, along with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice while he worked away. </p>
<p>I was singing "Bouncing Up and Down in my Little Red Wagon" to him this afternoon, and he quickly learned this first verse with me, coming right in the second time through it with, "Won't you be my darlin'?" That alone was darling but that sense of humour of his kicked in immediately as the third time around, he quickly came out with, "Won't you be my horse?" and then giggled away. It went on from there with yet another new addition of, "Won't you be my cousin?" He though that was the funniest of all, although kitten and BM stood a good second and third guaranteed laugh. </p>
<p>About 4:30 he told me he wanted to go home and see his sister -- I am loving hearing this! -- and I asked if he would like to drive home or ride his tricycle. The latter would be a first and he immediately chose this, much to my surprise. It shouldn't have been surprising though, given that he is changing so quickly in all things physical. He seems to have just discovered this part of his persona, and has decided to just be a more active and involved guy. It's great and I'm encouraging it, as hard as it sometimes is for me to see him attempting to climb up a dome without much structure underneath it. </p>
<p>So, off he went to put on his shoes and let me know he was ready; he had a grin from ear to ear all the way home. Steering needs a little work still, as he is more interested in watching his feet on the pedals than in what is ahead of him, but he's good on the brakes. He told me all about it as he learned it from a movie.. can't remember which one right now. He loved going downhill, but it was hard on my lower back, holding him back with that speed on his side! </p>
<p>We got to his place, and as he got off his trike he said "I am soooo tired!" and we talked about using his muscles to push the pedals, and how good that is for his legs. Off we went upstairs only to discover that no one was home; I hadn't called to let Akane know we were on our way. Bryn told me later that she and Mirei were on Valencia buying groceries. Riku's first thought was that they were hiding, so he checked his room, put some things in there on his bed, and then shut the door, something he has been doing a lot lately Bryn tells me. He likes the idea of having his things safely away, just like another little male Dyment I knew many years ago. Riku is like his dad in more than one way.   </p>
<p>We called home and Grandpa came "to the rescue!" as Riku said, and picked us up to come back here. It worked out well, as Doug left for T'ai Chi and Riku and I swept in the back yard; I pretended to be a witch on my broom, at Riku's request, but I told him that sometimes that gives him bad dreams and maybe we should stop for now. He played with his play table for a while, and swept along with me, taking out the sticks for himself. Bryn arrived at 6 o'clock, just as we had walked downstairs to do some chalk work on the sidewalk. This was fine with Bryn, and Tristin, the five- or six-year-old who lives down the street came by to join him for a few minutes. </p>
<p>Susan, Kevin, and Amelia were originally due in at 7:52 tonight from Anchorage, but their flight was delayed for an hour and a half. This worked out well for us, but not for them, who had already spent too long getting home. Doug was expecting to come home, dash out the door with me, and eat when he got home, but instead came home to corn-on-the-cob, ready to eat, and a mixed green salad with barbecued "ribs" cut up into it. It hit the spot and we both enjoyed it. </p>
<p>At 8:35 we drove to Rainbow, picked up a few groceries for Susan for tomorrow, some for us too, and drove right to the airport. They all looked pretty tired, but Amelia still had a nice big smile for me when she spotted me. We had a little running around time while the bags were coming down, and we learned that the holdup in time was due to the increased "orange alert", which took effect this morning. Their flight had been delayed in Chicago due to this... no food that had been purchased outside the secure area allowed on board, more searching, etc. They had a great time in Alaska, though, with lots of visits with friends and family, a block party, and two late nights for Amelia with two late morning sleep-ins too! </p>
<p>Out of the mouths of babes: Last night on the drive home from the airport we pointed out the full moon; Amelia said something about the moon was not hungry. We puzzled over that for a half minute until it hit us that because it was a <strong>full</strong> moon, it was, of course, not hungry! </p>
<p>And at one point, after she yawned, and then Susan yawned, Amelia asked her "Are you tired too, Mommy?" Such an observant and well- spoken little girl is Amelia. </p>
<p>Off to bed... 11:30 P.M.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/a_morning_with_amelia_and_riku.html">A Morning with Amelia and Riku, and Tub Time with Mirei</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn dropped Riku off on his way to work yesterday, who got to see just fifteen minutes of Caillou, one of his favourite book characters, and then we came downstairs for some drawing time before Amelia arrived with Kevin at 9:30. They were delighted to see each other and played so well together for the entire morning. They started off at their little table in the kitchen, and it was fun to hear them sounding like little adults. "Would you like to use the blue colour?" and "No thanks; I am using this one." right up to apologies if one bumped into the other, with the response being, "Oh, that's okay." They played upstairs with the Lego, and when I went up to check on them, they had built a huge building with a tower. </p>
<p>Both of them needed some running-around time, so off we went to the playground at 10:45. Sam was there, a little girl Amelia met two weeks ago, but for the most part they all just ran around, climbing the play structures, hiding under them, and wearing themselves out for their naps. Riku asked me to be a witch, and so I went after them for a bit, cackling my best cackle, with Riku and Amelia screamiing and running faster and faster. We all got tired out, although Riku would have someone chase him the entire time and not be tired of it. </p>
<p>Home for lunch; they sat at the big table with their own placemats, lighthouses for Riku and sea creatures for Amelia, talking about them and behaving ever so nicely. They had time for some more upstairs playing before Kevin arrived for Amelia at 1:30. I wonder if she managed to get home without falling asleep; she was a tired girl, after her late bedtime after arriving home last night. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep by 1:40 (after "just two minutes and I will go right to bed!"... and he did) and slept for two solid hours. I got all the ironing done and had time for a cup of tea and some sorting/reading at the table. I went in at the two-hour point, turned off the sound machine, and kept the door open so he could hear household sounds. He always likes to be cuddled and coaxed into waking up, even when he awakens on his own. How I love this snuggly time with him, as I'm sure it won't be going on too much longer. I talked to him about one day being a big grown-up man like his Daddy and Grandpa, and how I would be much older and he wouldn't even remember the days when we used to snuggle and cuddle and sing together. I know it will be with him forever, tucked away in his very being, but not as part of his consciousness. </p>
<p>Once he roused enough to join the world again, he decided it was time for a treat from his Easter basket, and chose three thin-shelled "eggs". Grapes and six-year-old cheddar were his afternoon snacks, and then we were off in the yard, sweeping and collecting sticks for quite a long time. </p>
<p>Back into the house we came, when the wind picked up and it was getting cooler. I was vacuuming on this level, when Riku told Doug that his "studio" was a big mess; we cleaned it up together, deciding what could be thrown out, what drawings should be hung up, and putting all the markers and coloured pencils in their proper places. Riku likes things to be neat and orderly, just as Bryn did from this age on, and Riku was very happy with the results of our tidying time. "There! That looks better!" </p>
<p>Bryn was later at the office than either of us expected him to be, so at 6:30 we were downstairs with the box of sidewalk chalk and his tricycle, so Riku would be right there for pickup. Bryn is always anxious to get home too, and it's easier if we are already downstairs with shoes on waiting for him. We spent fifteen minutes making pictures on the sidewalk, and Riku peddled around now and then. Interesting that when we went downstairs into the full sunlight the first thing Riku said was, "Let's find a shady place." Just like his parents and his Grandpa, Riku prefers to be out of the sun. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn had given Doug a gift certificate to "Cafe Gratitude", a vegan and mostly "live" (i.e., uncooked) foods cafe in the Mission District. It was the first visit for us to this very popular spot so close to home, and it won't be our last. I really liked it so much, and now want to try everything on their menu. It was hard for me to decide what to order tonight, and I couldn't have been happier with it. All the foods are named after an emotional statement or feeling, which was fun, as the servers named them as they put them in front of us. "I Am Bountiful" started us off: "live bruschetta (meaning the "bread" is uncooked)... Four slices of our live toast topped with fresh tomatoes, basil, garlic, stone ground olive oil and brazil nut parmesan." Yummy... garlicky and oh-so-delicious with really wonderful tasty tomatoes, and lots of it. Doug was presented with his entree "I Am Honouring"... chipotle and sunflower seed "refried beans" with guacamole, salsa, and cashew sour cream on a bed of mixed greens. Topped with Brazil nut parmesan and our live flax chips." He ate every bite of it, even though he said it was filling enough, especially after the appetizer, that he could have stopped half way through it... too good to, though! I had a "warm grain" bowl presented as "I Am Graceful" made up of steamed quinoa with fresh basil-almond pesto, organic tomatoes, sprouts, and Brazil nut pesto. I cannot tell you how many times during the meal I moaned and said that it was so good; it was just amazingly tasty! Mine too was filling, and I saved half of it for tomorrow's lunch; can't wait! We still have slightly less than a half of the certificate left, so we'll be going back for an entree and shared dessert next time. I know this sounds pretty flaky California... and is some ways it is... Doug felt like saying "I am Not Amused", but the food was so good and the super friendly service was perfectly fine with me; much better than a surly waitperson as far as I am concerned. </p>
<p>It is a casual friendly spot; we shared a table with three others at the beginning of the meal. The fellow poured water for us and one of the three told me what she had eaten and what she had had there in the past. The waitresses were super-friendly, the staff were very huggy-touchy-feely with each other, broke into song at one point, and had a "question of the day" which staff and customers were free to answer if they chose. The question today: "What do you feel you have contributed to make the world a better place?" </p>
<p>We had been home for about an hour when Bryn IMed asking if I would like to give Mirei a bath. Would I?! I haven't given her one bath yet; she baths at home in the sink, and I was more than ready to have her splashing about in the tub, playing with the tub toys Riku played with at her age, and seeing that chubby little body of hers. Bryn had told me she likes her bath and does she ever! She was just grinning away, loving the water pouring out of the faucet, going on her tummy, lying back on my hands, being moved over the water, but mostly going after the small rubber ducks and the twirling tub toys from Gail and Tom many years ago. She is so funny... when she is excited about something, her whole body shakes and shivers as though she is cold. I could make it happen every time by swirling one of two toys for her. I washed her hair, bundled her up in the warm towels, and massaged her with Aveeno. By the end of it, she was one very tired baby. Bryn bundled her up for the stroller ride home and told me she was asleep before his second wave to me at the window, and continued to sleep in the house, still in her stroller. Yay, team! </p>
<p>I did a little emailing, and went upstairs to watch some Oprah tapes, just to veg' out and put my feet up. Doug was surprised to find me still awake at midnight, but I was awake until almost 1:30. I may be sorry in the morning, but what a fun day this was.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/pool_time_and_pizza_night.html">Pool Time and Pizza Night!</a></h2>
								<p>Doug went off to his T'ai Chi lesson, the official last day of the beginner's class. From now on, they are considered to have a basic understanding of the form, and for the rest of their lives will be refining this form. Quite an accomplishment, and Doug is enjoying it very much! </p>
<p>Bryn called to say that he was coming over with the children to do the laundry while Akane spent some time on her own at the studio. It is getting harder for Mirei to be happy there for long anymore; she wants to move more and have more attention paid to her too! Not long after they arrived, Kevin called to see if he and Amelia could come over too, for some pool time. It is already heating up in the city, and our place is sunny in the back yard but cool in the house. He and Bryn got busy pumping the pool up and then giving it a good cleaning as well. Meanwhile, I got to watch Mirei roll around in the living room and inspect all her soft toys. Amelia and Riku were helping out with the pool and I gathered up some tub toys to add to it. The water was cold but the children were happy to run in and out of it anyway. Amelia was wearing a sweet little polka dot bathing suit she bought in Alaska, and Riku was wearing his Hawaiian shorts, almost too small for him. </p>
<p>Mirei was a tired girl, rubbing her eyes, and without realizing Bryn had a bottle for her, I successfully fed her from a drinking glass, with pumped breast milk from the freezer! I was amazed at how well she did, but Bryn said they have been giving her sips of water for some time now. Bryn also started feeding her solid foods last week. She had had her first taste of it before leaving for Japan, but was back on liquids during that busy time. Now she has had nori and cereal and Bryn says she ate a huge bowl of it after it was made up with too much liquid. Oh yes, this little girl likes to eat! </p>
<p>I just held her in my arms, cradling her, singing to her, and slowly swaying with her. She was asleep with five minutes and I successfully lay her down in the front bedroom, "nesting" her with four pillows as I still do with Amelia and Riku. It worked and she slept for one hour and forty-five minutes! </p>
<p>Ours was a busy house, it was! The dads kept an eye on the children, Kevin and I took some photos, the children had yogurt and toasted whole wheat bagels for their lunch outside, and by the time it was close to nap time I had them bundled up in warm towels as they negotiated for more time together. They're pro's at it! First they cuddled up on the twin beds, with Amelia's arms around Riku's neck, snuggling up and covering themselves with the soft blanket I had used for Mirei. They both closed their eyes as though they were really going to go to sleep. Hah! And then it was a trip to the bathroom for Riku, "just two minutes" for some playtime upstairs with the Lego, and another two minutes for something else. Finally, the ploy was up, we waved goodbye to Kevin and Amelia (Kevin kindly emptied the pool and cleaned up while we were having our extra time inside), and Riku was asleep within seven minutes. </p>
<p>He napped for one hour and forty-five minutes as well, running happily out of his room without calling out for me to cuddle him... most unusual but just how I want him to waken. Bryn had taken Mirei to the studio to be nursed, and stayed there with her until it was time to get Riku after his nap. Riku had a little snack of cheese and grapes, a little drawing time, and off he went home with his family for just forty-five minutes before we planned to leave for our usual Saturday night pizza night out. I had continued with the laundry and had it done, but for one load, before we left at 5 P.M. </p>
<p>Dinner was delicious! We went to "Patxi's" in Hayes Valley; it is a fairly small place but they put two tables together for us, a sleeping Mirei was in her car seat on the floor, and Riku happily sat drawing while we waited for our deep dish pie. We shared a salad while we waited, and Riku and his parents nibbled on carrot sticks Akane had brought along. We had a very friendly waitress taking care of us, the pizza was delicious... Riku ate a whole slice of his own, and we enjoyed it very much. </p>
<p>Riku asked his dad "What are we going to do after pizza?" and since there was a new-to-us playground just around the corner, one we spot when we drive to his school, we all trooped over there for some "exercise". Riku talks a lot about exercise these days; we have been discussing healthy foods and keeping our muscles strong and building big muscles by climbing, running, and moving around. He told Bryn the other day that he had strong elbows! So, we ran and chased and climbed and got our heart rates up, while Mirei sat pulling on a blade of grass and being perfectly happy for the longest time. </p>
<p>Riku left with the promise of a tricycle ride on his street, while Doug and I came home for some computer time. I made tea and took it upstairs while watching some taped Oprah shows; Doug has run out of tapes, since I have been away so much. A lot of them are repeats so I managed to get through two of them, and cross that "job" off my mental list. I fell asleep after 11 P.M. though, came downstairs to check emails, and finally went to sleep after reading far too late... it was after 1 A.M.! Arggh! Must get to bed earlier tomorrow night!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/sunday_already.html">Sunday Already!</a></h2>
								<p>I spent most of the morning and afternoon today finally getting a good start on all the filing, paperwork, sorting of papers, etc. that need to be done before I leave for Ontario in just ten days! Egad! I was very efficient, cluttered up the kitchen table for hours, and accomplished so much, but not quite all, of what needs doing. </p>
<p>Bryn had called to say that they were all off for a visit with Amelia, Susan, and Kevin, would be going for a noodle lunch after that, and would I like to have Riku here for his nap. Of course! He sleeps well here and is used to the routine so it's just a matter of singing a song and closing the door behind me. They were much later than planned, though, as it was almost 2:30 when they dropped him off; the doorbell rang, and there was Riku sitting in my empty laundry basket, laughing away at me. Adorable. He told me he was hungry and wanted a "snack", so two tiny ginger cookies later, plus a bowl of custard and a glass of milk, he was ready to be tucked in. At 4 P.M., worried about him napping so late, I turned off the sound machine, opened the door, and expected to hear him up before too long. However, at 4:50 he was still asleep! I encouraged him at that point to waken, going in and moving around a little in his room. We snuggled for a bit, and a half hour later he was in the tub, playing with <strong>all</strong> his tub toys, and barely leaving enough room for him. </p>
<p>Bryn was here at 6 o'clock to pick him up for dinner so I quickly washed Riku's hair, snuggled him into his big warm blue towel, and off he went with his daddy, a hungry boy by his own admission. I made us a quick dinner here, using up more freezer items, since I am determined to not have stuff falling out of it every time I open the door! I wrote a few emails, tidied up, did a little more paper sorting and finally went upstairs with a hot cup of tea to get through a couple more taped Oprah shows. </p>
<p>And up walked Bryn with a smiling girl in his arms, ready for a quick visit with her Nana! I turned off the TV, and we sang songs, and I played peek-a-boo with Mirei, which she really liked; I even had time to read a book to her before her daddy took her off home. I first bundled her up in a snuggly sleeper of Brynnie's, though. Bryn kept telling her how adorable she looked, and she did. </p>
<p>After some computer work and yet more filing, I went back up to my shows and fell asleep watching them towards the end when it was close to midnight. Night night...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/were_going_to_the_zoo_zoo_zoo.html">"We're Going to the Zoo, Zoo, Zoo... "</a></h2>
								<p>.. and so we did! Riku and I have been singing this song for a week or so and today was the day. I picked him up at 9:40 and we arrived after a short wrong turn -- as always(!) when I try to go the shortest way -- at 10:15. We started off at the giraffe and zebra exhibits, went on to see the lemurs, and stopped by the meerkats and gophers. Riku ran through his favourite tunnel, hiding on the side "shelf", and we were at the petting zoo at 11 A.M. to meet up with Susan and Amelia. </p>
<p>Amelia had slept until 9 o'clock this morning, still not quite in sync' after her trip to Alaska; it meant she missed her last gymnastics class, but at 11:15 we were together for a couple of hours. They flew by as always, with time in the "barnyard" with the sheep and goats, although Riku was far more interested in raking the ground than almost anything else. He even managed to find an extra rake for Amelia, and she kindly shared her kibble food so that he too could feed some of the less agressive goats. </p>
<p>Riku did his usual collecting of sticks on our way to a couple of other exhibits. We saw parrots and some monkeys, but Riku was tired, and it was lunch time before long. We sat inside today, at a very crowded cafe, and had lunch together. </p>
<p>Susan bought teriyaki salmon and kindly shared it with me, Amelia had fish & chips and some of Riku's fruit, and he ate all his egg and almost all of his fruit as well. He helped drink Amelia's orange juice earlier too; she kindly "fed" it to him as they sat in the rented wagon, although both children spent more time out of it then in. I ate half of the delicious tofu muffaletta sandwich Bryn bought for us yesterday, and shall eat the other half tomorrow. </p>
<p>The zoo is very close to the section of Ocean Beach where we always play, and as I knew would happen, Riku was asleep in the car by the time we got there. I sat and read until the forty minute mark, when Riku almost always "stirs", and then drove through Golden Gate park, finding another cool spot to sit in until he awoke at the hour and a half mark. We were very close to a playground we seldom go to, and Riku was keen to play outside; this worked very well. He had fun running around on the play structures, down the slides and up the ladders, and found a couple of boys to sit in the sandbox with and play when he was tired from running about. We left at 4:30, just as everyone else was heading home as well. </p>
<p>Home for dinner; Riku got busy "cooking" for us while I prepared ours. He was so verbal and so busy with it, asking if Doug would like tea, did he want the blue cup or the red one, did I want a handle on my cup, I didn't want sugar in it, right? and on it went. Doug was shaking his head at all of this outpouring of details. But, in the midst of it, he set the table so nicely with cups and plates, glasses, and food for us, while I quickly made Riku a bowl of noodles with lots of veggies in it; he ate every bite of it. Doug and I shared a commercial pizza and a plate of vegies, Riku had custard and more grapes for dessert a little later on, but the best part of the evening was Riku cleaning out my "extra bags" cupboard. It has been overflowing for ages, and I asked Riku if he would do a job for me. He immediately said "yes", and  then asked what it was. I had him pull our all of the bags, and asked him to sort them into plastic and paper piles. There were literally hundreds of both and he did an astounding job of it! Doug and I told him so too. </p>
<p>As he was sitting drawing, Riku piped up with a comment I have never heard from him before... "I'm worried." I asked him, of course, what he was worried about and he said that he worried that his daddy hadn't said hello to him today, or goodnight to him yet. So I called Bryn and Riku told him his story; Bryn, of course, planned to come over before ping-pong to say goodnight to him, as he almost always does, but it was interesting to hear Riku come up with this thought. I think he is trying out his new words. </p>
<p>I find he is quite impulsive with his hugs and kisses lately. I was sitting on the sofa reading, with a cup of tea nearby, and Riku came running in from his "work" at the "studio" to hug me and tell me he loves me. It's pretty darned sweet to hear him say goodbye on the phone the way we Dyments and Rodgers do, ending each conversation with "buh bye; I love you", and ending with a big smack of a kiss. Amelia is doing the same thing too and it makes my heart melt to hear it from these little ones. Both of them always run to wave goodbye from the window too, as parents leave. We have done this since Kelly and Bryn were little, and we have always been lucky enough to have a window with access making this possible. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped in just as Riku was eating his dessert; they had a little time together, and then it was PJ, teeth, and tuck-in time for Riku. We read "Olivia" tonight for the first time, a loaner from Amelia, who is a big Olivia fan. Riku enjoyed it too, and looked very carefully at each of the darling drawings, mostly black and white with some red highlights. Bryn dropped in to say goodnight to him just as he was finishing up. </p>
<p>I had to package up the bags, clean up after dinner and our outing today, and was tired enough that I went to bed at 10:30... no reading, just right to bed.</p>

							<div class="entry">
								<h2><a href="/2006/08/a_cool_and_breezy_tuesday.html">A Cool and Breezy Tuesday</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke up at just past 7 A.M. today. The first words he spoke were "I had a dream last night. Not a bad dream. A good dream." When I asked him what he had dreamed he immediately went into quite a bit of detail: "I dreamed I was in a house upstairs with two woman. No, one woman and one man. I was eating rice. My hands were dirty." I asked if he had been eating it with chopsticks or his hands and he told me "I was eating it with my dirty hands." Interesting that he remembered it so clearly; I don't remember a child this young telling me about a dream, but I think it helped that he had just wakened. </p>
<p>Before getting on with our day, we sat and read five books to his dog and mouse; they were paying close attention, as Riku made sure they could both see the pages, and even reassured them when he thought they might be worried about anything, such as the alligator or the vulture in one book particularly. When I told him I was going to leave and make up his fruit plate he said "Oh, don't leave me. I will be lonely." All these feelings he is expressing so clearly these days!</p>
<p>However, I did get his strawberries, nectarine, and banana on a plate for him, and we took it upstairs to eat while he watched "Caillou" and I had my three-minute shower. I joined him for the last half of the show, as he really likes company when he watches TV. He always has lots of questions to ask, and of course it was such fun to watch his face light up as Caillou spotted a moose drinking from the lake during the camping adventure. Rosie, the little sister, makes Riku smile too, and he was paying lots of attention as she hugged Caillou and he told us what a good brother he was. Riku is too. </p>
<p>We came downstairs for more playtime before breakfast. Once again, Riku was busy making breakfast, for me alone today. I had a lovely fruit plate (gee, I wonder where that idea comes from?) and he apologized that he had only one strawberry, but had two apples and two clumps of grapes. I also had rice, cucumbers, and an egg, plus hot tea of course! Delicious! Riku had a bowl of hot oatmeal today with blueberries and raspberries in it. </p>
<p>Needing a little time on my own to get some things accomplished around the house, I took Riku home at 10 A.M., expecting to have Bryn drop him off at 1 o'clock after lunch with them, and expecting to collect Amelia at 12:15 from school. However, Susan called to say that Amelia has been fighting her naps lately and was still having later naps after the trip to Alaska, so we planned to meet at a playground later if time permitted. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped Riku off at 1:15 for his nap; I had volunteered to have him here, but thought I would be experimenting with gettting both children settled in for their naps. Riku told me he was hungry, and so had two little ginger cookies, milk, and a dish of custard. His grandpa joined him too, and they discussed how Grandpa likes fruit in his custard, but Riku prefers his plain. </p>
<p>He napped from 1:40-3:40, which was perfect time-wise, but he was still groggy when he woke up! Lately he acts as though he cannot get enough sleep. I think it must be a growth spurt, as he is eating far more than usual too, and I guess the sleeping more is part of it. </p>
<p>He even said he was going to nap in the stroller on the way to the playground(!)... insisting that the hood be kept down as it was darker. He was trying to sleep I think, but didn't, but then wanted to sit in the stroller when we got to the park; this has never happened before! He didn't want to play in the sandbox; he really just wanted to sit and watch the other children playing.</p>
<p>Finally, I talked him into racing with me around the grassy area and  he perked up. Akane showed up with Mirei just as we had started in at this, and then he went on to climb around on the dome, and told me I should exercise on it too. Once again he showed us his elbow, so we could feel how strong he is; what a guy! I did a little hanging around on the dome so he could see I was exercising too. He told Bryn the other day that if you watch TV your muscles get soft, so he is certainly getting the idea that we need to move our bodies, and reminding me to do so as well. </p>
<p>We left the playground about 6 o'clock, and Riku walked all the way home. On the way there, he had spotted some orange plastic pellets and had me picking them up for him, but on the return trip he found lots more and we collected them together. The fresh air was obviously just what he needed, as he was such a happy boy by the time I said goodbye at their door. Mirei had dropped off to sleep almost as soon as they got to the playground. </p>
<p>Doug was at T'ai Chi when I arrived home; I made a bowl of my "instant" soup with kale, ww pasta, and celery, made a cup of tea and read as I ate my dinner. Still sorting through baskets of paperwork, got a few more emails answered and now am down to just twelve, the most important twelve of them all, as they require longer answers... I'm so far behind with them! </p>
<p>Doug came home, ate his usual after-class burrito, and got right back to work on the looming deadline; this should be the second last night and then it's done! I went off to bed and had the lights out at 11:30...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/san_francisco_to_cupertino_to.html">San Francisco to Cupertino to Ocean Beach</a></h2>
								<p>I slept in later than I thought I would, wrote a quick group email to my sisters, and then had to really dash into the shower to get out of the house on time. Made up cold and hot snacks and lunch for Riku, grabbed a half bagel with peanut butter for my breakfast, and was out the door at 8:45 as planned. Whew! </p>
<p>Riku was very interested in everything he could see out the car window today; he commented on the trees, the flocks of birds, the cows on the hills, and the big tractor-trailers we passed on the way to Ellen's. We arrived right at 9:45 and Ellen was there with her big smile to greet us. Riku made himself at home immediately! </p>
<p>We went outside, as Skippy (their little dog) was waiting for someone to throw balls to him. Riku obliged happily, and was delighted to see her jump into the pool after them. Lindsay came out with her suit on, and they had the best hour splashing each other, playing with Skippy, tossing a big ball between them, and just having fun. Lindsay is great with children, and Riku took to her immediately. He said "I 'member her!" and it's because her photo is on the fridge and I always tell him he has seen her at her house. That was two years ago, I think, but still he thinks he remembers her. </p>
<p>Ellen pulled out some of the girls' toys, so Riku had some inside fun too. There was the Fisher-Price farm, a newer version of the one we have, a peg game, a doctor's kit, which is a tad superior to the one we bought him, and best of all, a small battery-driven air hockey game. Riku adored it and played it with all three of us. </p>
<p>About a half hour before we were leaving to have lunch with friends of Ellen's, Lindsay's sweet boyfriend came by. Well, then Riku was really in his element: two "big kids" to play with! They had such fun. They chased him around the house, pretending to be monsters; Riku got to chase them and even got to doctor them too, giving needles and checking out their reflexes with the "hammer". They were just wonderful with Riku, and exhausted by the time we finally left for lunch. </p>
<p>We were meeting up with Victoria, whom I have known for years, plus a newcomer to their circle: an 88 year old widow called Grace. She introduced herself to them at their regular bakery/coffee/tea shop about six months ago, and has been lunching with them almost every Wednesday since. Riku went into the bakery first, where Judy, the owner, remembered him from our last visit; he got to choose a free cookie, one covered with lots of coloured circles, and I bought him a glass of fresh strawberry juice, mixed with just a little bit of honey. Riku sat and visited with them all at an outside table while I went off to buy a notebook and some pencil crayons, the one thing I forgot in my dash out the door. When I got back, Victoria and Grace told me how he had corrected their pronunciation of his name, just as he had in Nanaimo. "My name is not Riko! It is Riku, but this time he spelled it out for them. They were very impressed! </p>
<p>We had lunch at a Japanese restaurant next door, and it was just the nicest lunch. Riku sat and drew what everyone guessed was a whale, laughed at his little jokes ("This is <strong>not</strong> a whale! It is a cat and dog!"), and were astounded when he asked if he could have some sashimi... raw tuna, which he spotted on Grace's plate. She was having it for the first time in her life, and was delighted to let him have all the rest of it! I had a big plate of vegetable tempura, which Grace said she will have the next time; Riku ate some noodle and vegetable soup I had taken along, as well as a big container of strawberries and nectarines. Victoria was so taken with Riku, and kept saying his name with a real trill, in her South American accent, trying to get Riku to do it as well. She can't wait to be a grandmother! </p>
<p>I stopped in at the bakery as Judy and her husband also make Japanese and Chinese treats, savoury and sweet. Akane is very fond of them, and thinks they are a very good quality, much like the ones she enjoyed for lunches as a schoolgirl. I always take home a selection of them for her, and once again she was delighted with all of them. </p>
<p>We said our goodbyes, but had time for a quick photo first with all but Victoria, who had left early for a doctor's appointment. Riku was a tired little fellow by this time... full tummy, lots of exercise, and lots of stimulation from all the new people in his life. We drove home, Ellen asked if he would like to borrow the hockey game, and a happy little boy waved goodbye. However, just as we were leaving, Ellen was holding him for a hug, and asked him if he would like to stay with her. He willingly agreed and was ready to wave goodbye to me! Gee, guess he really had a great time! We'll be back. </p>
<p>Riku napped for only forty-five minutes; I know he was still tired but I didn't encourage him to go back to sleep by continuing to drive. Instead we stopped at a windy Ocean Beach, although I didn't expect to stay. Riku does not like the wind at all (he's like his Auntie Kelly that way), but he was fine with it this time. We sat in the sand and dug holes; he found lots of treasures... strings, a cord from a headset, and some rocks, and was a very happy boy for the whole hour and fifteen minutes we spent there. I stopped in at the Beach Chalet to use the washroom which Riku likes to do, as he gets to see the tiny overview of the area, with little trees, tiny houses, and lakes, etc. on display in the bottom of the "chalet". </p>
<p>At 5:30, we pulled up at Riku's home so he would have some time there with his sister and mom, but we caught them going out the door to run an errand. Riku was happy to have me go up to his room and check out the new Container Store storage for his toys; we sat and played UltraMen and monsters, he showed me lots of his DVDs, assuring me I would like them "this one is a little tiny bit scary but it's just pretend; it's okay, I will watch it with you" and then doing some building with interlocking plastic knobs. Akane was back with Mirei in just a half hour; she offered to cook a noodle dish for me to take home for dinner with Doug, and so I sat and played on the floor in Riku's room with both children for a half hour.</p>
<p>Mirei is sitting so well! She is very well balanced, and can lean forward to take her brother's toys now. He gave her hugs and kisses outside when we met them, and more inside too. When she got a little too close to his "art" work... a tower he had saved from another day, he ran to the living room and came back with a couple of her own toys to play with. I took a kajillion photos of the two of them and can't wait to see them. </p>
<p>Doug is still busy working crazy hours but the big deadline is tonight and then I should get two albums online; hope so anyway! We both thoroughly enjoyed the large portion of noodles Akane sent home with me, and I should have saved some for tomorrow... didn't though. Yum! </p>
<p>Tea, read, wrote a couple of emails, and the evening disappeared once more. Lights out at 12:30.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/an_afternoon_with_amelia.html">An Afternoon with Amelia</a></h2>
								<p>As my time for flying off to Ottawa comes closer, my days just zoom by faster than ever. I have no idea what happened to my morning, although Doug and I did run an errand, to pick up some free coffee, beignet mixes, and coffee mugs... all offered on freecycle, the amazing "sharing" of goodies no longer wanted by subscribers. The gal who had offered them was super-friendly and helped me carry the five gift baskets down from her office. On the way home, we stopped in Noe Valley; I had my hair cut and Doug poked around the record stores. Back home, I found a message from Susan saying Amelia was expecting me to pick her up after all; she wasn't at all sure about this last night. </p>
<p>Amelia was obviously tired when I arrived at her nursery school at 12:20, and was a little sad that her mom wasn't there to pick her up. However, that lasted all of two minutes until we started talking about what books we would read at nap time. I told her about my "Everyday Story Book" we haven't read before, and she decided on "Skippy", the lost dog story. All went well... the timer was set for five minutes of playing before tuck-in, Amelia liked the story a lot, tut-tutting at the poor dog's situation in the cold, dark house, and we cuddled up for her drifting off time... except she didn't drift off! There was a problem toe nail to work on, and then a fingernail inspection, and different positions for her baby snowman to sleep in, etc., etc. After forty minutes of lying with her, it was obvious sleep was not imminent and so up she got, telling me she had a little cold... and sure enough, her nose was running. </p>
<p>She was a busy girl after that; she worked with two different colours of Play-Doh, strutted around with the chicken tea cozy on her head, chatted a bit with Doug, who was cleaning up a few odds and ends from last night's deadline, but took the time to show us how to email a drawing she made on the computer "to Auntie Gail" at Amelia's request. We copied it to her mom too, as it was very colourful and lively, and now it's on its way to Oma in Victoria, via slow mail. Susan printed it up for her. </p>
<p><br />
At 2:45, at Susan's suggestion, I tried once again to tuck Amelia in for her nap; otherwise it was going to be a very tired girl that her daddy picked up later on. She had ten minutes on the timer, and used it to play upstairs by herself, but, as promised, came right downstairs when called and despite saying she still wasn't tired, those big green-blue eyes said otherwise. She didn't take seven minutes to settle this time 'round, and slept for an hour and thirty-five minutes. Perfect! </p>
<p>This gave us time for snacks (toast and cheese) and another story from my book, plus one of her very all time favourite activities... pushing the bee on the stick around and around the house. Kevin called at 5:25 to say he was on his way over, and we were outside walking up and down the sidewalk when he arrived not ten minutes later. We were looking for the cat across the street, but had no such luck. </p>
<p>Doug was off to T'ai Chi and a "graduation" dinner with his teacher and classmates tonight, so I had a few hours on my own at home. First I made a hot cup of tea, and sat in the living room reading a new Canadian novel I received for my birthday, dragging out the tea as long as possible, and then got to work, tidying and dusting each room and finally vacuuming this floor. I cleared out a large number of stacks of Doug's that had been put away for my birthday party, and now hope that Doug will have time, while I'm away, to find room for them. We are out of book space! I think I said that last night... </p>
<p>I got lots done today, despite it being busy for most of the daylight hours; looks like I might be organized in time for Wednesday after all! Oh, I did some IM-ing with Kelly and Brynnie tonight too... a nice surprise as they have been away a lot this summer. Spoke with Riku on the phone tonight as well, telling him our plans with Auntie Susan and Amelia tomorrow. More about that... tomorrow!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/three_days_to_ottawa.html">Three Days to Ottawa!</a></h2>
								<p>Doug and I had a quiet morning at home; I was determined to get lots done today and did so... laundry, vacuumed upstairs and down to this level again, sorted out all the items that are going to Ontario and put them in the bedroom in one place, cleared out the upstairs hallway where too many suitcases are stored, and cooked up rhubarb for Doug... all this along with time for a leisurely breakfast over the Sunday paper. Doug and I also went through the B.C. trip photos, so that he could get them into an album for me. There are over 270 of them, after careful culling! It's ridiculous! ... but they sure are nice to have. </p>
<p>I called Bryn to suggest that he bring Mirei over for a visit; turned out my timing was perfect as he had been about to leave for a visit with the children to Susan's and Kevin's. Mirei has a long nap in the morning so it made sense for her to have it here; that way Amelia and Riku could play without worries about being too loud for the baby. It also meant that I could have some time alone with her, which doesn't happen very often at all. Akane was at the studio so this worked out well for everyone. </p>
<p>Mirei rolled around on the living room carpet, sat up for the longest time ever, bending way over to pick things up from beside her, and then easily getting herself back to a sitting position. I took lots of photos of her, of course, but haven't seen them yet. Doug is still busy working on the other thousand of them waiting to be dealt with! </p>
<p>I gave her a huge portion of cereal that Bryn had brought over for her. She likes to eat, this little girl(!), and her little tongue would stick out when she was ready for the next bite, and she would lean forward. It was adorable, and Bryn said later the funniest thing of all is to hear the low rumbling grunting sounds she makes when she wants more faster. Doug got a few perfect photos of that open mouth waiting for more. </p>
<p>I gave her some warm breast milk in a sippy cup and she did very well with it, although next time I will use a regular cup as she does well with that too and I can see how far to tip it back for her. I took her into Riku's room, turned on the sound machine, lay her on her back, surrounded by pillows, tucked a blanket firmly around her, and lay below her, where she couldn't see me, and rubbed her tummy gently in circles. She tried once to get up and twice cried out, but in less than five minutes I was walking out the door, closing it quietly behind me. What an easy baby! </p>
<p>Mirei slept for an hour and a half; by then Bryn and Riku were here for lunch, and once Bryn left with Mirei for nursing at the studio, I tucked Riku into bed. Bryn dropped Akane at home with Mirei, Riku napped for an hour on the nose, and Bryn came by and spent a little time with him here. They went off home, leaving me a little time to continue with packing chores; Riku had some time on his tricycle around their house, and Doug and I went over for a little time with the children there before dinner. </p>
<p>Mirei was sitting in the high chair in the kitchen when we walked in, watching her mommy cook, but she joined Riku and me in his room, sitting on the bed and playing happily with the toys that Riku ran to get for her. He goes over to her now and then to give her a gentle hug and a kiss, or to take away anything of his that she is getting too close to. He told her, "No chewing, Mirei!" as he took one of his books from her and then asked why babies chew so many things. </p>
<p>Riku's first words, always, when we walk in are, "Come play with me in my room." and lately he has started enticing us in with "I have something very interesting to show you!" raising his eyebrows for emphasis. Doug and Bryn were busy working at a few projects, so we played with Lego, read a couple of books, and Riku played two of his Japanese song books, which caught Mirei's attention each time. Riku sings along in Japanese with most of them.</p>
<p>Akane had cooked a delicious meal for us, as always... a Chinese noodle dish, sweet and sour tofu, and a lightly fried rice dish. Riku ate a nice big plate of dinner, trying to use his chopsticks ("How I use these?") and trying hard to copy Doug. Bryn is the left-handed guy though, and my guess is that he will be the one teaching Riku how to use them one day. Mirei sat at the table with us in her new IKEA highchair, eating another huge bowl of rice cereal with sweet potato added to it. Those two little teeth aren't ready for anything more quite yet, but no doubt she will be eating everything on her plate too. </p>
<p>Had a little more time together after dinner in Riku's room with Mirei; got Riku into his PJs with teeth brushed before leaving around 9 P.M. Doug and I spent some time on the computer before heading up to bed. </p>
<p>... Oh, Riku said tonight, "I usually have the glass with the star on it." First time we have heard him say "usually".</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/monday_already_1.html">Monday Already...</a></h2>
								<p>Egad! I leave for Ontario in just two days; hardly seems possible! Bryn dropped Riku off for me this morning on his way to work, and there was time for only three minutes of Caillou. Riku was disappointed, as he likes the show so much and doesn't get to see it very often. However, he watched "Old Bear" with Grandpa while I had my shower and put away the laundry, all done up for the trip. </p>
<p>Quiet morning at home... read some stories, ate breakfast together, Riku made me quite an elaborate "breakfast" too, and insisted that I eat the egg and rice before eating the fruit. That, along with an ice cream cone, was my dessert. Riku is asking some tough questions these days... "What is mind?".... and told me tonight "I just thinking about something; I was thinking about trains, and school, and many many things!" He also did a lot of role-playing, which was very interesting; he pretended he was angry with me, and then wanted me to pretend to be angry with him. We frowned at each other, apologized to each other, and talked about being angry. I forgot to mention yesterday that he asked, "What are dreams?" and seemed satisfied with my answer that they are pictures that come to your mind when you are sleeping. Perhaps that is what prompted the "What is mind" question tonight. </p>
<p>I called Uncle Frank this morning to see how he was feeling, and had a chance to talk with Neal too. I also got some photos of the trip to B.C. annotated this morning, although have a lot to do still. </p>
<p>Doug had to go to Toys R Us to buy some dominoes for a training session tomorrow, so we went along for the ride. This was lots of fun for Riku, as he wandered up and down the aisles, stopping to inspect anything that caught his eye... a rubber sword, big plastic fish, power figures, too many things in packaging for his liking(!) but did he love the wandering about! It's great that he doesn't ask for anything, although mentioned he would like the sword. I bought some paint for him to replace the colours in his little pots, although he didn't know that until we got home. </p>
<p>We went to a Target store too, and he and Grandpa walked around looking at a few things while I did a bit of shopping for Caillie's and Bryn's upcoming birthdays. He was very interested in the DVDs and spotted "Corpse Bride" immediately, telling me it wasn't really very scary, just a little bit. </p>
<p>We stopped at a Taco Bell for a bite to eat in the car on the way home; Riku enjoyed a cheese quesadilla and was happy to learn from Grandpa that this was a Spanish word. Riku said tonight that he knows lots of Japanese words, lots of English words, and a few Spanish words. He demonstrated by saying "buenos dias" and repeating "quesadilla". And to think he might be learning to speak Chinese in another year! </p>
<p>I read a couple of stories to Riku in the car while he ate, and then he napped in the car on the way home. Doug stopped on the street; I was in the back seat with Riku and read and dozed a bit myself! We had a pretty mellow late afternoon at home; he wandered in and out of the back yard for a while, painted and rediscovered that blue and yellow mixed together make green. Next on the agenda was "painting" on the computer, using the Jackson Pollock site that Uncle Frank sent us last week. Amelia has been enjoying that site too, and Susan sent a lovely e-photo today of her working away at it at home, in her PJs. </p>
<p>Doug went off for his T'ai Chi class, and Riku and I played a couple of games of matching the cards, and he played with dominoes on his own while I cooked up some noodles and veggies. After his bath time, with the smallest number of items in the tub ever in his life(!) -- just three: the big BC ferry boat, a smaller motor boat, and a plastic container to use for washing them. Cleanup was a breeze tonight! </p>
<p>In the tub, Riku said, "I'm sad. I don't know if Daddy will call me to say goodnight." This is twice this week I have heard this from him, and I really think he is learning to speak about his feelings. It came right out of the blue and then he went back to playing. A half hour later Bryn called and they had a little chat. I realized while he was in the tub that he hadn't played with the button box for ages, so once he was out, after a lovely warm snuggle in the heated towels, he sat at the table playing with them, rediscovering all his favourites.</p>
<p>Weighed Riku before he went to bed tonight and he weighed his heaviest ever: 34.5 pounds! He has been eating so much and so frequently lately, and I noticed how roundy his cheeks looked in the tub, so it was fun to find out he really is getting bigger.  </p>
<p>Doug went off to pick up a booster car seat from our "freecycle" group and it's a beauty... a beige "suede" in wonderful condition which will replace the other. Now Mirei will have a seat when I have the two of them in the car at once. I'm expecting that will start to happen once I get back from Ontario and she is too big for her little carryon seat. </p>
<p>I IMed with Bryn for a few minutes this evening; Akane took her first Cantonese language class tonight and didn't have her pronunciation corrected once in the three hour class! Bryn said it sounds really bizarre to hear Chinese coming out of her mouth, but she is a good student and likes structure, so this will no doubt be a successful endeavour for her. </p>
<p>And that's it; time to write a couple of birthday cards for Doug to mail when I'm away. I am feeling quite prepared for this trip, although I know there is still lots I could do to leave here more caught up on things that need doing in the house. </p>
<p>Exciting news tonight from Susan and Kevin; they are expecting a baby boy in early January! Amelia is going to be a big sister, and what a good one she will be; she loves being around babies, holding them, touching them, and cooing over them, so imagine how happy she will be to have one in her own house! </p>
<p>Riku sleeping soundly in his bed; I shall be turning in shortly myself... now almost 11 P.M.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/ahh_ontario_in_august.html">Ahh, Ontario in August</a></h2>
								<p>Woke at 8:15 this morning, just in time to get Uncle Frank's breakfast on the table, so that we could sit together and eat before he left for his swimming physio at Shaver's. After he left, I stripped his bed and discovered he had a duvet cover, and not a comforter!, so that could be washed as well. Showered, talked to Beth, Glenn, and Kelly, and there went my morning. I also had time to delete all the junk emails from the server, leaving me with about fifteen to answer at some point. </p>
<p>UF and I had lunch together, a three-salad combination from food I brought home from Candy's and Rick's. He was hungry after his swimming session, and we sat with our tea and chatted for a while after lunch. Then off we went for a drive in the country; it was overcast when we started out, with a few sprinkles here and there, but the sun had broken through before long. </p>
<p>Our first stop was at the friendly "Mountain Road lady", who sells her own wonderful produce. We had bought strawberries from her in June,and now she had wonderful peaches, blackberries, gorgeous tomatoes, and Concord grapes; we couldn't resist any of them. </p>
<p>Then we went off to a pottery place UF had discovered on his own last month; he had bought some cereal bowls and bread and butter plates, and thought there were flaws in them. The lovely Swiss woman told him the two streaks were just part of the drying process and so he happily had her bundle them up for him again. </p>
<p>I had mentioned to UF that we hadn't been to the cheese factory he had mentioned on my last trip home; he was quite sure he could find it, and after a stop for directions we did indeed find it, on a parallel road from where he had thought it was. He hasn't been there in years so I was impressed! We made it there with minutes to spare before the 5 P.M. closing, thank goodness, and got to sample both of their cheeses... a delicious "white, bloomy rind cheese with a silky, semi-soft interior"... soooo good! and a "washed rind cheese fashioned after recipes developed by the Trappist Monks of the Loire Valley" called "Niagara Gold". UF bought a nice (expensive) hunk of the first which cost $17, but which will be delicious with our fruit platters. </p>
<p>Next on the list was a stop at our wonderful rose spot from June; we wanted to check and see her prices for peaches and UF decided next trip we will buy the white fleshed peaches, which are sweeter than the red variety. I bought some new potatoes though, as they looked too good to resist. </p>
<p>Finally we headed back to the Falls from the Niagara-on-the-Lake district, stopping for groceries at the A&P before picking up our Tuesday night special at "A Fine Kettle of Fish": fish and chips for $4.25 a portion, a bargain for sure. </p>
<p>Home for dinner, groceries away, checked email quickly, and called San Francisco. Amelia was not answering the phone, but Riku was home, and we had a short chat. He told me he was "just sending you a message; I am drawing two pictures, not on the whiteboard, but on paper, one for you and one for Uncle Frank." He was "playing with Daddy and Mirei" and soon told me he had to go, no time for a song, but maybe tomorrow as he was busy with his sister and daddy. Wow! I could hear such a change in his voice and in the way he is talking now; interesting how a week can make such a difference, but I know it's different when I hear the children's voices on the phone too. Mirei has cut a third tooth, on her top right! Bryn tried to get her to make some sounds for me, but she wasn't in the mood and I could only hearing her briefly.</p>
<p>Grapes and tea, a crossword puzzle, and port while trying to do a NY Times crossword in the living room. The Niagara Falls Review puzzle was a little tougher tonight but nothing compared to the NYT! </p>
<p>Bed at 12:15... lights out at 1 A.M.... still too late! </p>
<p>Notes from Bryn today: Lying in bed at night, Riku said, "You're nice, Daddy."  I replied, "Thanks Riku... I'm glad that you think so." He replied, "I'm glad that you're nice."  He is just such a supremely special little guy.</p>
<p>His "reading" is astounding.  Getting better and better at calling out <br />
all the letters on the fronts of his books.  Upper and lower case.  <br />
Faster and faster at it.</p>
<p>He can almost write "DYMENT" from memory, and just wrote "JOHN" for the first time tonight. "JOHN RIKU DYMENT" uses 13 of the 26 letters, so once he can write his name he's halfway there.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/08/feels_like_fall.html">Feels like Fall</a></h2>
								<p>Lazy day around here today. Uncle Frank went off to his physio this morning while I puttered about the house; I washed the bathroom floors, swept the kitchen, and did a little ironing. Beth returned my call; she slept until almost 10 A.M. today, but we chatted for a long time about canning methods and what she is going to do with the windfall from her garden. </p>
<p>After a leisurely lunch, and some computer time for UF, we drove over to "the ranch" as UF now calls it, and Beth walked us around the garden. I picked about thirty tomatoes and could have picked more, as well as a few onions. Beth pulled off a squash for us, two big beets for the tops (although I will cook up the beets too), a couple of small peppers and a handful of grapes. Hers are not quite ready yet, but bountiful and getting close. </p>
<p>We sat on the porch for a bit, a must-do when visiting, and took a couple of fun photos of us "feeding" Uncle Frank grapes. Jeff was busy cutting the lawn with the riding mower, and EJ, Mel', Alysa, and baby Myles came by for a while. This was my first time seeing this baby in person and what a doll he is... big blue eyes, wide mouth, and lots of smiles and cuddles. And of course I took some photos! </p>
<p>The only post office in Stamford Centre has closed down, so when Tammy arrived to pick up Beth for work, we headed off to Lundy's Lane, now the closest post office to Uncle Frank! From there we went to Ian's, hoping for a visit with them. No one was home, so we sat on their tiny deck chatting for a half hour or so; later Ian told me they were sitting at Chippawa Creek in comfy chairs, watching the world go by, something they often do on his days off. </p>
<p>Home for a few minutes before dropping UF off at By's and Jo's for dinner, and heading off to visit with Marie and Graham. I picked up a veggie burger from Burger King, and ate it in the car before my visit. No point showing up hungry; last time I ate three pieces of delicious white toasted Italian bread! We had tea, and caught up on all the news of our grandchildren, our favourite conversation of all these days. </p>
<p>By' dropped UF back home and installed a new brass door knob on the back garage door; they put most of the recycling and garbage out as well, and UF and I just had to do the rounds in the house when By' left. </p>
<p>The rest of the evening was our usual quiet one here... the NF Review crossword puzzle, which we finished so quickly that we continued on with the NY Times puzzle from the night before. I talked with Riku for a bit while UF worked away at it. Riku was in a very silly mood and I laughed most of the way through the short conversation. Knowing bathroom and body parts words in Japanese has proven to be quite a lark for Riku! I could hear Mirei fussing in the background; it was bedtime for them both. Once again I missed out on talking with Amelia, but I left another message for Susan. </p>
<p>Our evening ended with Sleepytime tea for UF, bowls of peaches and berries for both of us, and, of course, our nightly glass of port. Bed too late again somehow... light out at 1 A.M.</p>
<p>The morning was cooler today and the air felt like "fall"; the afternoon brought warm sunshine but the night cooled off... the leaves will be changing colour soon down here.</p>
