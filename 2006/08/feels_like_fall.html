								<h2>Feels like Fall</h2>
								<p>Lazy day around here today. Uncle Frank went off to his physio this morning while I puttered about the house; I washed the bathroom floors, swept the kitchen, and did a little ironing. Beth returned my call; she slept until almost 10 A.M. today, but we chatted for a long time about canning methods and what she is going to do with the windfall from her garden. </p>
<p>After a leisurely lunch, and some computer time for UF, we drove over to "the ranch" as UF now calls it, and Beth walked us around the garden. I picked about thirty tomatoes and could have picked more, as well as a few onions. Beth pulled off a squash for us, two big beets for the tops (although I will cook up the beets too), a couple of small peppers and a handful of grapes. Hers are not quite ready yet, but bountiful and getting close. </p>
<p>We sat on the porch for a bit, a must-do when visiting, and took a couple of fun photos of us "feeding" Uncle Frank grapes. Jeff was busy cutting the lawn with the riding mower, and EJ, Mel', Alysa, and baby Myles came by for a while. This was my first time seeing this baby in person and what a doll he is... big blue eyes, wide mouth, and lots of smiles and cuddles. And of course I took some photos! </p>
<p>The only post office in Stamford Centre has closed down, so when Tammy arrived to pick up Beth for work, we headed off to Lundy's Lane, now the closest post office to Uncle Frank! From there we went to Ian's, hoping for a visit with them. No one was home, so we sat on their tiny deck chatting for a half hour or so; later Ian told me they were sitting at Chippawa Creek in comfy chairs, watching the world go by, something they often do on his days off. </p>
<p>Home for a few minutes before dropping UF off at By's and Jo's for dinner, and heading off to visit with Marie and Graham. I picked up a veggie burger from Burger King, and ate it in the car before my visit. No point showing up hungry; last time I ate three pieces of delicious white toasted Italian bread! We had tea, and caught up on all the news of our grandchildren, our favourite conversation of all these days. </p>
<p>By' dropped UF back home and installed a new brass door knob on the back garage door; they put most of the recycling and garbage out as well, and UF and I just had to do the rounds in the house when By' left. </p>
<p>The rest of the evening was our usual quiet one here... the NF Review crossword puzzle, which we finished so quickly that we continued on with the NY Times puzzle from the night before. I talked with Riku for a bit while UF worked away at it. Riku was in a very silly mood and I laughed most of the way through the short conversation. Knowing bathroom and body parts words in Japanese has proven to be quite a lark for Riku! I could hear Mirei fussing in the background; it was bedtime for them both. Once again I missed out on talking with Amelia, but I left another message for Susan. </p>
<p>Our evening ended with Sleepytime tea for UF, bowls of peaches and berries for both of us, and, of course, our nightly glass of port. Bed too late again somehow... light out at 1 A.M.</p>
<p>The morning was cooler today and the air felt like "fall"; the afternoon brought warm sunshine but the night cooled off... the leaves will be changing colour soon down here.</p>
