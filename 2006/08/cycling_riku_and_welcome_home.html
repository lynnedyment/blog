								<h2>Cycling Riku, and Welcome Home Amelia!</h2>
								<p>I had the morning hours through 1 P.M. today to catch up on paper work and I made good use of my time. My "paper" basket was overflowing, and I spent three hours tackling that project, sorting and filing and making notes, and tossing. Still lots to do but I made a very good start at it, after deciding to delay the ironing for one more day. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped Riku off at 1 P.M. He had been home for lunch and Akane had decided it might be best for Riku to come for his nap and a playtime, rather than in the other order. It worked well for me, as I had a nice big chunk of time in the morning, when I am most likely to keep at it! He walked in saying "I want to have dessert before nap time" and so a bowl of his favourite custard was soon on the table. Riku is being so good about just accepting the amount of time he has to play before needing to nap; if I tell him five minutes, he is willing to just go along with that, although he will sometimes attempt to negotiate "just one more minute", or even two or three. Sometimes I agree, sometimes not. </p>
<p>Today he spent his five minutes in his "studio", going over everything on the table, but also told me that "Mirei was so messy today!" When I asked him why, he told me in great detail that she was eating "noli" and made a big mess... on her hands, all over her face, and around her mouth. I didn't understand what he said she was eating, but he did explain that it wasn't fish, or fruit, or vegetable. Turns out it was mashed nori, but he was saying it the way the Japanese pronounce it, and it was just different enough that I didn't understand it. Tomorrow I will have him tell me again, so that I recognize it the next time. </p>
<p>I forgot to mention the other day in Nanaimo that Riku told me, "My Mommy speaks a little bit of English, my Daddy speaks a little bit of Japanese, and I speak a little bit of English <strong>and</strong> a little bit of Japanese"! Doug commented today after hearing this, that the time is soon approaching when he will be better in both languages than his parents are in their second one. Mind blowing! </p>
<p>Riku was asleep in just a few minutes today and napped for an hour and a half. He was a little grumbly when he woke up, and actually dozed back to sleep for a few extra minutes once I went in to turn off the sound machine and open his door. He needed some cuddling time too, and was then ready to sit and build roads in the clay "table". Of course I always suspect that he is hungry when he is grumbly and it solved the problem once again... six-year-old cheddar cheese and thinly sliced apple, along with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice while he worked away. </p>
<p>I was singing "Bouncing Up and Down in my Little Red Wagon" to him this afternoon, and he quickly learned this first verse with me, coming right in the second time through it with, "Won't you be my darlin'?" That alone was darling but that sense of humour of his kicked in immediately as the third time around, he quickly came out with, "Won't you be my horse?" and then giggled away. It went on from there with yet another new addition of, "Won't you be my cousin?" He though that was the funniest of all, although kitten and BM stood a good second and third guaranteed laugh. </p>
<p>About 4:30 he told me he wanted to go home and see his sister -- I am loving hearing this! -- and I asked if he would like to drive home or ride his tricycle. The latter would be a first and he immediately chose this, much to my surprise. It shouldn't have been surprising though, given that he is changing so quickly in all things physical. He seems to have just discovered this part of his persona, and has decided to just be a more active and involved guy. It's great and I'm encouraging it, as hard as it sometimes is for me to see him attempting to climb up a dome without much structure underneath it. </p>
<p>So, off he went to put on his shoes and let me know he was ready; he had a grin from ear to ear all the way home. Steering needs a little work still, as he is more interested in watching his feet on the pedals than in what is ahead of him, but he's good on the brakes. He told me all about it as he learned it from a movie.. can't remember which one right now. He loved going downhill, but it was hard on my lower back, holding him back with that speed on his side! </p>
<p>We got to his place, and as he got off his trike he said "I am soooo tired!" and we talked about using his muscles to push the pedals, and how good that is for his legs. Off we went upstairs only to discover that no one was home; I hadn't called to let Akane know we were on our way. Bryn told me later that she and Mirei were on Valencia buying groceries. Riku's first thought was that they were hiding, so he checked his room, put some things in there on his bed, and then shut the door, something he has been doing a lot lately Bryn tells me. He likes the idea of having his things safely away, just like another little male Dyment I knew many years ago. Riku is like his dad in more than one way.   </p>
<p>We called home and Grandpa came "to the rescue!" as Riku said, and picked us up to come back here. It worked out well, as Doug left for T'ai Chi and Riku and I swept in the back yard; I pretended to be a witch on my broom, at Riku's request, but I told him that sometimes that gives him bad dreams and maybe we should stop for now. He played with his play table for a while, and swept along with me, taking out the sticks for himself. Bryn arrived at 6 o'clock, just as we had walked downstairs to do some chalk work on the sidewalk. This was fine with Bryn, and Tristin, the five- or six-year-old who lives down the street came by to join him for a few minutes. </p>
<p>Susan, Kevin, and Amelia were originally due in at 7:52 tonight from Anchorage, but their flight was delayed for an hour and a half. This worked out well for us, but not for them, who had already spent too long getting home. Doug was expecting to come home, dash out the door with me, and eat when he got home, but instead came home to corn-on-the-cob, ready to eat, and a mixed green salad with barbecued "ribs" cut up into it. It hit the spot and we both enjoyed it. </p>
<p>At 8:35 we drove to Rainbow, picked up a few groceries for Susan for tomorrow, some for us too, and drove right to the airport. They all looked pretty tired, but Amelia still had a nice big smile for me when she spotted me. We had a little running around time while the bags were coming down, and we learned that the holdup in time was due to the increased "orange alert", which took effect this morning. Their flight had been delayed in Chicago due to this... no food that had been purchased outside the secure area allowed on board, more searching, etc. They had a great time in Alaska, though, with lots of visits with friends and family, a block party, and two late nights for Amelia with two late morning sleep-ins too! </p>
<p>Out of the mouths of babes: Last night on the drive home from the airport we pointed out the full moon; Amelia said something about the moon was not hungry. We puzzled over that for a half minute until it hit us that because it was a <strong>full</strong> moon, it was, of course, not hungry! </p>
<p>And at one point, after she yawned, and then Susan yawned, Amelia asked her "Are you tired too, Mommy?" Such an observant and well- spoken little girl is Amelia. </p>
<p>Off to bed... 11:30 P.M.</p>
