								<h2>"No More Naps!"</h2>
								<p>Riku has become very opinionated these past couple of weeks about his needs and wants. He was busy today after lunch, and I told him I was setting the timer for five minutes until his nap. He held up his hands and in a very firm authoritative voice pronounced "No more naps!" It made me laugh out loud as he sounded very serious about it, and I'm sure he was! </p>
<p>He knows without a doubt what colour Play-Doh he is going to use each time. "Green". "White". No second thoughts, no changing his mind. Once he has announced the colour off he goes to get it. And it's interesting that he never ever plays with two at a time either. </p>
<p>When I ask if he would like an egg for breakfast, for instance, he will tell me exactly what he wants. He still often uses the third person and will say "Riku want an egg, bacon, no toast" and the hand goes up to make it clear that toast is not to be given. </p>
<p>I often give him a choice as to what he could choose for lunch... mac' and cheese, or noodle soup, egg and bacon or porridge. He always knows and states his choice clearly. If I ask him if he wants more he will often say "no, I okay", or "no, Riku fine" with a serious nodding of his head, furrowed brow and all. </p>
<p>Riku seems to waken from his nap knowing exactly what he wants to do; it could be drawing, or making me a meal in his kitchen, making "toilet paper" out of Play-Doh, playing with his animals in the sink or using the clay box from Auntie Susan. He knows the latter is Amelia's and he knows we are just borrowing it, but once in a while he likes to see if I have forgotten that, and will tell me it is his claybox... and then checks the look on my face, taking notice of my raised eyebrows and smiling at me.  </p>
<p>Last week we discovered, on our walk from his house to ours, a piece of sidewalk filled with the most interesting bits... smooshed slugs, dog bm, cat bm, and worms, often stepped on worms, and the newly discovered gum pieces. It was a long slow block home that day! The next day I suggested we go down one block earlier just for a change and I was nixed... "No slugs down there, no bm, we go this way!" Okay! I'm happy to please, when it takes so little effort to make this  boy happy.</p>
