								<h2>Just Call Me "Toddler Tamer"!</h2>
								<p>Bryn left for school early this morning and Kelly went off at 8:35 with Caillie, leaving me to finish up my morning routine here. Kelly does call-back at the school on Fridays at 9:30, so I had time to putter about, answer a few emails, and grab a bite to eat before she picked me up at 10 a.m. </p>
<p>We had a few hours together downtown, which was such a treat, as it so rarely happens. We went bra shopping together for me, something I just don't take the time for on my own, bought some books, and finished off with a delicious lunch at La Commensal, a restaurant we both enjoy so much. Tofu, tofu, and more tofu, with some cooked greens for me and a selection of various goodies for Kelly; neither of had leftovers today! </p>
<p>I had plans to spend the afternoon with Liz Lawless, so Kelly and I got on the subway together and I got off at Bay Street to meet Liz at Indigo Books. We walked from there to Sarah's house, enjoying the beautiful homes in Rosedale along the way. The day couldn't have been better for a walk; not too warm and not cold or windy either: a perfect spring-like day. </p>
<p>We stopped in at Jerry's and Liz's little pied-a-terre in the city first, to say hello to Jerry and have a cold drink before leaving for Sarah's and Rob's. It was lovely to see Sarah, who is always so welcoming; the baby Callum, whom I've been seeing photos online of since he was born seven months ago, is just adorable, with big brown eyes and perfect eyebrows. Sarah left to pick up Aidan from daycare, and we had time to chat and admire Callum. </p>
<p>Aidan is a sweetheart with a big smile, but shy at first. He thoroughly enjoyed looking over the Caillou book I had bought for him, a peek-a-boo book which Riku likes so much at this age too. We did some of a floor puzzle together but had to dash off soon after Sarah came down from tucking in Callum. </p>
<p>On the walk to the subway, Liz told me that she thought that Aidan would have had a full blown outburst if I hadn't been there; he wanted his mother while she was busy with the baby, and instead we had a fun half hour together. Liz told me I should hang up my shingle! How nice...</p>
<p>I arrived home at 6 p.m. in the rain, after a subway ride from St. Clair West. We, all seven of us, had plans to go out for dinner at Sakawaya, a Japanese restaurant on the Danforth. This is to be Caillie and Bryn's birthday dinner out, courtesy of Gregg and Kelly; the two children wanted to have all of us experience the restaurant they discovered with their Dad some time ago. They are regulars there and Bryn has discovered a favourite dish... tomago, an egg dish. </p>
<p>We arrived shortly after 6:30 and left after 8 p.m. We all enjoyed our dinners, but the service was very erratic; I had all three of my dishes immediately, and Bryn's didn't arrive until almost 8 p.m.! He ordered a bowl of rice to keep him going as he was so hungry by the time he got the two servings of his dish; they didn't any left of the third one he had ordered. Bryn is growing so fast and is eating bigger and bigger portions of everything these days. He had tasted a little bit of several other dishes too but I'm sure would have eaten more than he ordered. </p>
<p>I had three dishes... two brochettes of tofu and mixed vegetables, agadashi tofu, and deep fried cheese which got shared with all the children. Yum! I would have liked it better if the service had been better; next time we will go at a much slower time, although we were the second table seated as it was.  </p>
<p>We all walked home in the very mild evening air; the children got ready for bed almost immediately, and we adults had a typical evening... I was mending, Kelly was relaxing watching tv with me, and Gregg was busy at the computer... not typical for him, but he was working late today. Lights out for me at 12:15 a.m.</p>
