								<h2>A Quiet Thursday Evening...</h2>
								<p>Well, here I sit all alone, a very rare occurence for the longest time, so thought it was a good time to get back to blogging. It's 8 p.m. on a Thursday evening in Toronto. Kelly is teaching a CM class, and Gregg and the children are at a neighbourhood meeting for another hour. I'll type as quickly as I can, and try my hardest to catch up on the past few days, while I still remember them! For the weeks before this, I have made some notes and shall try to do blog entries for the most important ones, such as the couple of days before Mirei was born! </p>
<p>Caillie and I woke at 9:15 this morning and then lay in bed for another hour, telling each other our dreams (one I remembered is that a bag of raisins I was taking on a trip, and left in a hallway at the airport while fetching my passport, was deemed to be a threat and carried away in a bomb-safe container! ... interpret that!), drawing pictures on each other's backs, to try to guess what they were, and ending with "five in a bed and the little one said... " (three were stuffed animals). </p>
<p>I just had time to shower quickly, check my email, and make some toast and "fakin' bacon" (as Gregg calls it) for Caillie and me, before dashing out the door with Bryn for an early lunch at Movenpick. We hadn't had time for our lunch out alone together in the fall and thought this would be a good day to do so. However, as Bryn pointed out on the subway, we were only going to have a half hour to gulp down our pizza and shared rosti before leaving to meet Kelly and the other children at the movies. We nixed that idea, and settled for a quick Subway sandwich for Bryn; we will try again tomorrow. </p>
<p>"Narnia" was wonderful; I loved it and so did the others. In fact, Bry' and Myk' had seen it already and wanted to see it again. We ate popcorn and drank pop, put our feet up and enjoyed it all thoroughly. </p>
<p>Once home, Bry' asked if I wanted to get started on his and Bryn's room. He was the first to ask so as soon as he finished piano practice, he, Bryn, and I got busy. It took a good two-plus hours but it looked great once we got rid of all the Christmas gift packaging, did a little flinging, and sorting. There were a lot of children in all their rooms before and after the holidays so they really did need help to sort it all out again. Looks great, with just a few shelves to clear and dust. Tomorrow I will tackle either Caillie's or Myk's with them. </p>
<p>We go to bed early around, here which is a blessing really. Wiki is ready to sleep around 10:30 but not if there are adults around to play with, so we will be heading upstairs for my third night before midnight. This works well for me, and I will be well rested when I head to the Falls again on Sunday! </p>
<p>Chatted with Candy tonight by phone once everyone had left the house, tried to call Gail but she and Tom are out, and Skyped with Doug as well. Lots of Christmas cards, so it was fun to hear what mail had arrived while Doug was here. Hoping to Skype with Bryn and perhaps Riku too. Must get Susan signed on this machine and perhaps I can say hello to Amelia too... not that the house is usually quiet enough to hear anyone! What a busy household this is! The two dogs are sleeping right now, but wouldn't be if the children were here to engage them in more fun things to do.</p>
