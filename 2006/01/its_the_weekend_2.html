								<h2>It's the Weekend!</h2>
								<p>.. as Riku would say. Caillie and I awoke at 8:20 with enough time for me to draw a few pictures on her back. I wrote to Uncle Frank and Carol Woods; no other emails for me, so I guess everyone is fed up waiting for me to write! </p>
<p>As soon as I was dressed and downstairs, later than I thought it would be, Bryn and I started cutting out and decorating gingerbread men; I did the cutting while Bryn put in the eyes, nose, mouth, and belt in the same way we have been doing for years. I have made gingerbread with both Bryn and Caillie every year since they have been old enough to stir the batter. </p>
<p>The house smelled wonderful when we left at 11:30 for the Science Centre, and each of the children, and a couple of the adults too, enjoyed a soft, warm, tiny gingerbread man on the way out of the house. </p>
<p>There is a much-talked-about exhibit at the Science Centre called Body Works 2. It consists of bodies, and body parts, from cadavers which have been plasticized. It is a controversial process, but was incredibly interesting, and not at all disturbing to any of us in any negative way. The children were all bored before the adults had completely finished it, but all showed interest in different things. We saw complete body parts, bodies "stopped" in mid-motion, showing the muscles in action, and everything from babies in the womb to side slices of obese adults with their layers of fat. </p>
<p>We spent a full two hours at the exhibit, after first having seen a wonderful IMAX film called "The Mysteries of the Nile", which took us on a trip down the Blue Nile River, a trip full of adventure and misadventure, by an intrepid group of voyagers, not all professional kayakers or rafters. We all thoroughly enjoyed this. </p>
<p>At 5:30 we headed home, with piano practice for two of the children, and homework for them all before dinner. I made a big mug of hot tea, and relaxed in the master bedroom while Kelly checked her email and Gregg made us all nice big bowls of manicotti with red wine for the grownups. We're all feeling lazy and relaxed from all the walking and the cold dash back to the car.</p>
<p>Gail IM'd suggesting we catch up by phone, so as soon as dinner was over I took the rest of my wine upstairs, stretched out on the bed, and had a nice long chat with my sister.</p>
<p>Time for my evening mending while watching TV with Kelly; Gregg stuck his nose in now and then to take a peek with us, but was busy once again on the computer. </p>
<p>The weather has turned from spring-like to winter cold, with a high wind-chill factor and low temps. Brrr, Caillie and I will be snuggling up tonight! </p>
<p>Bedtime... 11:40. I can feel the cold air already!</p>
