								<h2>Niagara Falls to Toronto</h2>
								<p>Despite my assuring Uncle Frank this morning at 3 a.m. that I would no doubt be awake before 9:30 without benefit of an alarm, I woke up at 10:20! Ah well, we both needed that seven and a half hours sleep and I didn't feel the least bit guilty about it. However, it did mean I had to hustle and get showered, finish my bit of packing, make poached eggs and toast for our breakfast (and banana and juice), as well as do some fast trotting back and forth to the garage with the big recycling container, the garbage, the propane stove for Paul, and all the mail I had hoped to attend to with Uncle Frank, not leaving it for him to do. Alas, Uncle Frank said he would take care of it all after dropping me at the bus station for the 12:30 bus to Toronto. </p>
<p>Just as we were pulling out of the driveway, Rick and Candy drove in. Candy had forgotten an envelope of photos and was there to pick them up from the mailbox. Lovely to say goodbye to them both once more before they headed back to Ottawa. </p>
<p>I worked on Candy's scarf all the way to Toronto; the bus filled up to capacity in St. Catherines but I was tucked into a window seat and found it easy to concentrate on the knitting. It's looking good and I was so pleased as one more day will finish it off. </p>
<p>Kelly picked me up at 2:30; she had a couple of errands to run and I had her stop at "The Big Carrot" for a few containers of my favourite foods there (tofu, tofu, and tofu, prepared three different ways, and some hummus too... yum!) before continuing on to pick Bryn and Caillie from Jacob and Jamie Lee's dad's place. </p>
<p>Once I was in the house I had a houseful of children all anxious to while away the afternoon and evening playing board games. I was more than happy to oblige and we had great fun, with the children taking turns choosing what we would play. We started off with Candyland, Caillie's choice, next came "Fear Factor", went on to Junior Monopoly (no, I didn't know how many eggs dinosaurs lay!), and played "Smart Mouth" with Bryant, a game we had played with his Dedo (Grandfather Tilston) on Christmas day. </p>
<p>I had nibbled away on my tofu feast during the games so by dinner time didn't need another bite; usually I clean the kitchen after dinner but was so tired and relaxed I didn't even go in and get to it. Kelly is happy to let them wait 'til morning and I was more than happy to not budge once the children were in bed and I sat knitting. The scarf is coming along beautifully; one more day should do it! </p>
<p>Kelly, Gregg, and I sat watching TV for a couple of hours after the children were tucked in. I answered a couple of emails but am so far behind that once again I am feeling that I will never catch up. I just need one full day but it isn't going to happen this trip either. Not that I really expect it too; it's far too much fun spending time with everyone. </p>
<p>Wiki is ready for bed by 10:30 or earlier and if we are up, she thinks it is still time to play. So, we all headed up at 10:30, with me not quite ready for sleep yet. However, Caillie was facing the wall when I crawled in with her, so I put my pillows up, turned on the light and read until 11:30 p.m. Loving the Amy Tan book I'm reading right now so it's not hard to stay awake longer than usual.</p>
