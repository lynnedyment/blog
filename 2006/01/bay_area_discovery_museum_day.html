								<h2>Bay Area Discovery Museum Day!</h2>
								<p>Riku was looking forward to this day, talking about "water beds and lily pads" a few times yesterday, and it was a perfect day for it. Bryn dropped him off at 9 a.m. today, and we left the house at 9:45, with a lunch packed, snacks organized, and a happy boy in the back seat. We arrived at Ashbury Street at 10 a.m. and let Susan and Amelia lead the way across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausilito. </p>
<p>First stop, the meandering "stream" with lots of plastic fish, turtles, and a toad. Amelia likes to collect lots of them in her arms, and Riku likes to drop his under the little waterfall. They spent a happy half hour or more at this favourite activity, and then stopped to do some writing on blackboards with chalk as we left that area. Nothing was cuter than to see the two of them sitting side by side drawing away; Amelia did lots of lines today, and Riku seems to be into a new filled-in "round" stage. </p>
<p>From there we went into the painting/craft area where they were just in time for two cleaned-off pieces of glass for painting. Riku enjoys using the sprayer and then watching the lines of water dribble down through the paint he applied first; Amelia did lots of brightly coloured splotches before applying the vivid orange to her lips, hands, and arms! They had a great time and were ready to move on to something new within twenty minutes. </p>
<p>Amelia sat at the "clay" table, while Riku re-discovered the magnetic squares. He and Doug had used these together on a previous trip; he was obviously pleased to have so many to himself as only one other child was using them today. He joined Amelia on the other side of the clay table; they both squeezed, and rolled, and mounded the clay into various shapes, and much to our surprise happily gave it up when we told them it was lunch time. </p>
<p>Off we went to the cafe; Susan and I had panini sandwiches with mixed greens. Amelia shared the grilled cheese with Susan, while Riku ate the eggs and fruit I had packed for him, followed by a few cookies, including a new favourite chocolate-topped one of Doug's. It was busy inside the lunch room, but it was easier than trying to keep them away from the more exciting activities available from the outside tables. </p>
<p>Both children were tired and so we took a little time out for the boat and crow's nest before leaving at 1 p.m. We never did make it to the room with the water beds or "ponds" with the lily pads, so we must go back again soon. It was a lovely day, our last before the rain starts again. </p>
<p>Riku amazingly did not fall asleep immediately (Bryn told me he had a restless night, woke up at 6 a.m. with a dry diaper, needing to go to the bathroom! and then went back to sleep for an hour). However, he was almost asleep when we were just five minutes from home; I passed back the rest of his snacks which just managed to keep him occupied until we got in the driveway. </p>
<p>I set the timer for five minutes of free time (this is working well for Riku since November; he likes knowing the timer will let him know when it's bedtime) and he sat and drew before it was time for a Franklin story and tuck-in. </p>
<p>It took him a long time to settle in and he napped finally from 2-3 p.m. That is the second one hour nap in two days, short for what he usually has; Bryn mentioned later that Riku would have napped longer if I had been in with him, but I don't want to do that. He needs to sleep on his own, and I need the time to myself while he naps. (Later Susan told me that Amelia too had not napped in the car on the way home, and then slept for only forty-five minutes... must be something in the air today!). </p>
<p>We snuggled for a long time, leaning up against all the pillows for three stories. He rediscovered the "Franklin" books today which he liked so much last fall. </p>
<p>Then Riku was ready to play cars, and "crashing cars" on his bed with me. Every car came out of the basket and we had a grand ol' time sorting and crashing and fixing; some of them needed a "garage" and so we used a big wooden flat car for that purpose. We worked a new puzzle on the bed after he played for a bit with the clay box here in the kitchen. Then off we went back into his room, for "clean up" of the cars. </p>
<p>I am still looking for his favourite dog, which has disappeared since yesterday, and so while digging through the stuffed animal basket, discovered the big white mouse puppet that Jody had given him almost two years ago. He was delighted to see it again, and so we had such fun with that, and the tiny white stuffed toy mouse we have had for years. Riku hid him behind and under the bed, right in the corner, and then we had to "find him", using the flashlight Gail and Tom gave him for his birthday. I turned out the light in the bedroom to make it more exciting when the light fell on the little white mouse "hiding" in the corner. Each time Riku reunited the baby with her mommy, they had to snuggle and kiss; he is very loving with his "animals". </p>
<p>Riku had the rest of his strawberries and bananas when he first woke up, and a little later a half container of yogurt too. He weighed in at 31 pounds at the doctor's on Monday, not a big heavy boy by any means, but his cheeks and chin are looking quite chunky these days and he has a nice roundy little body and legs too. </p>
<p>Mirei went off with Akane for her first check-up here in the States, and then had to go for a genetic test of some kind. Hope to hear more about what this was for later on.... </p>
<p>Bryn was picking Riku up before 6 p.m. and as Riku had spotted the photo of the drawaing Susan had made of a dog using chalk on the sidewalk outside here, Riku decided that should be our next activity. Off we went outside to wait for Bryn, with lots of time for drawing, making numbers, and trying to see the cat across the street. It was just dusk and Riku enjoyed being outside listening to the planes, the dogs barking, some sirens and watching the buses as they passed by. Bryn joined us, drew a robot for Riku after admiring our drawings, and off they went. Riku wrapped his arms around Bryn when he got out of the car and said "I missed you <strong>so</strong> much!". The feeling was mutual and Bryn told him so. </p>
<p>Quick dinner for Doug and me... "chicken" burgers and some carrot sticks, and up we went to watch one of our NetFlix movies. It was a light comedy and I fell asleep as Doug rubbed my back and shoulders. I woke up in time to see the happy ending! </p>
<p>Bedtime early tonight... lots to do tomorrow.</p>
