								<h2>Bryn and Caillie in San Francisco!</h2>
								<p>After awakening several times in the night, calculating just what Bryn and Caillie would be doing at that precise moment, I finally gave up and got up at 6:30... when they would have been on the second plane, bound from Chicago to us in San Francisco! </p>
<p>We left in lots of time to get to San Jose International, and then ran into horrific traffic, stopped completely at times, just outside Menlo Park. There had been an accident and we crawled along for more than forty minutes; I tried very hard to just concentrate on listening to NPR and not worry about something I couldn't help. It was still hard to keep visions of these two children showing up with their attendant, with no Nana or Grandpa anywhere in sight! Finally, the traffic cleared and we parked at the airport at 10:31, just a few minutes after they had landed. We knew they would be last off the plane and dashed inside, to wait, thank goodness, about fifteen minutes for them. </p>
<p>Caillie spotted me first, and Bryn was right behind her; they looked terrific, excited and bursting with details about how their flight had gone (first time with no adult accompanying them), about the movie they saw, and how kind the attendants had been who took them to their plane in Toronto and then off the plane in Chicago, and on to the San Jose flight... and finally to us. While we were waiting for their luggage, a fellow our age came up and told us what well-behaved grandchildren we had. Of course we know that, but it was still nice to hear. Caillie had the window seat on the way here, on both planes, and so Bryn will have it on the way back. Interesting arrangement... </p>
<p>Off to "Fresh Choice" for lunch, one of the three restaurants on their list of places to eat. Bryn had a wee bit of salad, a few bites of hard boiled egg, grated carrot, a couple of cucumber slices, and some croutons, filling up on pizza slices and a muffin, for the second course, followed by some jello, and finally a dish of soft vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce, the real reason that he and Grandpa like "Fresh Choice". </p>
<p>Caillie filled her plate up with lots of dark greens, croutons, a tuna pasta, carrots, peas and corn, eating a little of most of the items, but not the tuna. I was happy to finish off hers; Kelly and I both like the tuna tarragon dish here. And then Miss Caillie had a cone of plain vanilla ice cream, followed by a dish of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles and caramel sauce and then assured me she was still hungry and sure could use another wee dish of it. Hey, she's on holiday so off she went, happily dishing up the sprinkles!.. and more sauce. </p>
<p>We made a couple of stops... for some Acme sourdough bread, some fresh fruit, a book store for Doug (we compiled our list of things-to-do while he was browsing), and finally a car washt, where we ate freshly popped popcorn and drank lemonade (free of charge, but where did we find room for it!?), and a one-cent pony ride for Caillie. She seemed a little embarrassed to be riding on this pretend horse, but really I think she liked it, but didn't want to appear to do so. </p>
<p>Brynnie was really tired, and curled up with a blanket and a head rest of Riku's, while Caillie rolled her window all the way down, stuck her head as close to it as she could, opened her mouth and took in all the breeze she could; she looked like a very happy dog, with her hair blowing and making happy puppy sounds. It was very funny and I snapped a couple of photos. </p>
<p>Kelly called on Skype almost as soon as we stepped in the door, to get all the news on their solo trip. Hans and Uncle Mark called later on as well. </p>
<p>We unpacked as soon as we got home, and while I put the bags away after resorting the ski and winter clothes into them, Bryn spent some time on the computer, IM'ing with friends. I have never heard anything like it... he logged on and almost instantly there were about six kids on there writing to him! One of them even "chatted" with Uncle Bryn for a few lines, when he got on to say "hello". </p>
<p>Not too much later we went off for a walk to Hampshire Street. Bryn had told Brynnie that Riku hadn't fallen asleep until 3 p.m. and awoke an hour later; Mirei was nursing and Riku would have needed a little help dozing off, so up he got. </p>
<p>The children were so anxious to see him, and to meet Mirei, and wanted a walk too. We arrived about 4:30, they both cooed away at Mirei, and got Riku smiling and agreeing to come over here to play with them for a while. He was tired enough that he wanted to sit in the stroller though, much to my surprise. It was windy and I covered him with a blanket which he happily kept tucked in around him. </p>
<p>Caillie pushed him the entire way home, even up the little hill on the next street down, and engaged Riku the entire way, asking if he wanted her to go fast or slow and making him laugh. We stopped across the street so that Caillie could climb the lemon tree to pick a lemon for Riku! He was delighted with it, but told her it was too sour and he wouldn't eat it. </p>
<p>The three of them played so happily, upstairs and downstairs, with Riku showing them all his toys, and so happy to be with them. It was really sweet to see; these two children are so good with little ones and Riku was at ease immediately with all their attention. </p>
<p>Bryn, Akane, and Mirei arrived about 5:45, and Mirei sat in her car seat on the kitchen counter, smiling at the fuzzy black and white chicken and at me when I stopped for some eye contact. Bryn had her chatting away at him, making noises at her, to which she responded so intently. </p>
<p>I made up a quick dinner of pasta with "meat" sauce, tossed a salad, and Bryn cut the bread for the table. Doug had left for his PEA meeting in the East Bay so there were six of us for dinner; it was fun for Riku again having both children paying so much attention to him and all his silly antics, even at the table, but it was soon over. Bryn was determined to get him home by 7 p.m. for an early bedtime tonight, so we waved goodbye at 6:55.  </p>
<p>Brynnie had a headache due to not enough water (his thought), so he  went upstairs to relax on our bed, watching some TV and just vegging out.. and drinking lots of water. Caillie joined him, but man did that girl eat! They both ate small portions of pasta and salad for dinner, but then Caillie ate a slice of bread, and then had another, which I toasted and took up for her, along with half a banana. And she was still hungry, so ate a small bowl of cereal and drank some milk! </p>
<p>They were both in bed at 8 p.m. (11 body time though), and I don't think either of them heard the last five pages of "The Lorax". </p>
<p>Tidied the kitchen, did some emailing, and am about to head off to bed at 10:30. Now that the children are here, I can stop imagining them going to the airport, getting on the plane, just taking off, etc., etc.  Night night...</p>
