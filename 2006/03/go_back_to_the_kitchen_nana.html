								<h2>"Go Back to the Kitchen, Nana."</h2>
								<p>Riku awoke at 6:30 this morning, and Bryn and Caillie just minutes later. This gave them two hours together before Bryn arrived to take Riku to school. They had a grand ol' time, playing cars on the bed, reading in the living room, doing a little drawing in Riku's "studio" (the little table in the kitchen), and tossing a ball back and forth. Riku did a great job, as Bryn tossed it a little high, and that gave Riku time to reach up and grab it. </p>
<p>We all went downstairs with Riku at 8:20 so he could draw a bit with chalk before heading off to school. Our plan was to get out of the house as early as possible and we did well... everyone had breakfast earlier but me, and Caillie had kindly made not only her bed this morning, but Bryn's and ours as well! </p>
<p>We caught the 9:15 bus to Market Street, which proved to be an interesting if eye-opening ride for Bryn and me, at least. There were two women on the bus, speaking loudly and with very "colorful" language about how their paroles were worked out, and whether one had to serve more than 60 days for a misdemeanor, or more than six months, as the other claimed she did! I don't take the bus very often, but I guess there are lessons to be learned. </p>
<p>Luckily, we immediately caught a street car, which took us to Powell Street. Caillie wanted to go in and ride up on the curving escalotor at the SF Centre; Bryn really didn't, but went along for her sake. This is happening a lot this trip; they both have different opinions about what is important to them. For instance, Caillie would love to walk across the Golden Gate Bridge, but Bryn doesn't this time. However there are also many things that they do agree on... such as the trip to Santa Cruz, and visiting Ellen in Cupertino, which surprised me. </p>
<p>There was no line-up for the cable car, but we waited for the car that took us to Ghirardelli Square rather than Pier 39, preferring to take the more scenic route. We decided to walk directly to Pier 39 just in case the rain started later, as we expected it to. Of course, the "bush man" was out, but they are on to him, and looking for him, so he just waved at us as we went by. The sea lions were next, and to our shock, we saw a dead sea lion hanging over the edge of one of the floats. It really looked as though it was dozing at first glance, but it was just too still, and quite a crowd had collected to watch it, and discuss it. </p>
<p>The children decided they were too old for the carousel(!), and so we wandered through the shop area, stopping to look at a shell shop, and then on to "Johnny Rockets" for lunch. They remembered they had eaten there last year with their Mom, Gregg, Myk', and Bry', and both agreed they would like to go again. Caillie has a bit of a sore throat and is not feeling up to snuff so she was happy to sit down for a while, relax, and get warm. This is a little girl who is always hot, so I knew she really wasn't feeling well. We had both gargled with salt water this morning before we left the house. </p>
<p>Back at Ghirardelli Square, we went searching for a little rabbit character that Bry' had lost in Las Vegas in the fall. Caillie was on a quest to find another just like it, but they are being discontinued and she decided on the newer version, hoping he will like it. She did a little extra shopping for others too. What a thoughtful child she is, looking for exactly the right thing for everyone, including the cats and the dogs! </p>
<p>Doug picked us up, as planned, at 12:35 to drive to Riku's school for him. Once again his face lit up as he spotted his cousins and he proudly pointed out the calendar he had made. He told me he ate all his lunch, and then ate his oranges really quickly too! The children were great as they kept things nice and low-key, both in the car and at home, during his "just ten minutes playtime for the timer" before his nap. </p>
<p>Bryn wrote in his journal while Riku napped, and then played some computer games after finishing up the dough we started yesterday. He basically did it all, the sifting and the measuring, and it's now in the fridge to be rolled, when we have a quiet hour together. He also made orange juice for us all, and chatted with his friends on MSN for quite a while. Uncle Bryn was part of the group of four he was on with at the same time! UB was trying to determine what the plans for tomorrow are... as it's his birthday! </p>
<p>Riku slept for two-plus hours, and when I went in and asked if he was ready to get up he cried and said "I not <strong>want</strong> to wake up yet" and went back to sleep for fifteen minutes. I left the door open and when we heard him next, the children went in quietly to him, until he started smiling and interacting with them.  </p>
<p>They so badly wanted to go to the playground with both Amelia and Riku after naps today, but Susan had written to say Amelia had not napped long enough and would be getting into her night routine very early today, and Riku just wanted to stay put and play with Play-Doh and them, of course! What good cousins they are; I knew they were disappointed at staying in all afternoon, but they sat so patiently at the table with Riku, making all sorts of things and keeping him company. </p>
<p>Finally, he was willing to play something else, and when I walked in the bedroom to see what they were doing, Riku looked at me and said in no uncertain tones "Go back to the kitchen, Nana." I used to be his best bud', his favourite "gorl", his constant compadre... but not now! However, I must say he always wants a big hug when we part, so all is not lost. </p>
<p>Doug and the children left at 6 p.m. to pick up some groceries at Rainbow, and to get the two half-baked pizzas from Amici's restaurant. This is on their lists, and tonight is traditionally pizza and movie night in Toronto. Doug had rented a movie he thought they would like so we had our plans all set for the evening. </p>
<p>Bryn came in for Riku just as they were leaving, but Riku wanted the same book Bryn had been reading to him earlier read to him twice... and then wanted his big hug before we all went down to look at the moon and the big storm clouds. </p>
<p>The pizzas were great and I made up a big plate of raw veggies to go with them. I decided not to watch the movie, but to get busy making the fillings for the quiche shells I had started earlier. There was a big boom of thunder and I called to see if Riku had heard it; we are both very fond of thunder and lightning, although it's such a rare experience for Riku that most of his expertise comes from pictures on Grandpa's computer. However, he told me he had heard it, and I hope he saw some lighting too... </p>
<p>Late bedtime for the children as the movie was a long one; they turned out their light at 9:15. Tomorrow they will be in bed at a more regular time for certain; Caillie especially needs it right now. </p>
<p>I made three quiche fillings... broccoli, mushroom and spinach, and a tomato-basil filling of Sandy's, for which she kindly sent me the recipe not long after I had asked for it tonight. </p>
<p>Cleaned up, wrote a few emails, annotated the photos from today, which Doug had put up, and off I go to bed... 11:50... too late. Busy day tomorrow I know... there is a birthday cake to make! </p>
<p>Happy Birthday, in remembrance of my Dad. 1917-1987</p>
