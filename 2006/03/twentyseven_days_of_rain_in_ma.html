								<h2>Twenty-Seven Days of Rain in March... so far!</h2>
								<p>I spent the rainy morning in the house, writing emails but mostly talking on the phone, catching up with Amelia from Niagara Falls and with Tay, my former SF friend, now living in Everett, Washington. She's in town for a week or so, and we made plans to get together soon. In no time I seemed to be heading off for Riku's pick-up at 1 p.m. It was raining so hard that his teacher carried him out to the car, holding a large umbrella over both of them! </p>
<p>As he did on Monday, Riku chatted all the way home. For the second or third time ever (except when someone is in the back seat with him), he didn't have to fight sleep, which is much more relaxing for me, not worrying about whether he will fall asleep minutes from home and his comfortable bed! We have such wonderful conversations these days, and today I heard all about "The Iron Giant" DVD he watched with his daddy last night, as promised. I learned that the giant was a "good guy", that he didn't like guns, that he has a little boy who is his friend and that the movie was "a little bit scary", said with a slightly furrowed brow as he talked about it. </p>
<p>I love the way he often says "You remember that, Nana?" or "Yes'erday we... remember that?" And now "tomorrow" is also part of the discussion as in "maybe tomorrow we will go to 'Melia's playground, remember I play there one day on the winding blue slide?" as we pass by the playground on Oak Street coming home. </p>
<p>Today we read two books... Amelia's loan of "Alexander and the Wind-Up Mouse" which he so enjoys, and "A Colour of His Own". Riku napped for an hour and forty minutes today, although he was coughing quite a bit. I had to go in and settle him a few times and finally snuggled in with him for the last twenty minutes. </p>
<p>When he was ready to awaken, he gave two little snorts. I had my head near his shoulder, so I snorted twice too. He repeated them, I repeated them, and then he laughed out loud and sat up. Riku had slept with three mice animals today, and a little ant-eater (Skippy, his dog is still at his house; he promised to bring it back "tomorrow, okay?"), and wanted to play house with them all. So, we stayed in bed ("Let's snuggle a little while, okay?"), hiding the mice and the ant-eater friend under the pillows in a little nest. He would then use a squeaky voice and ask me to help find the mice; he had them in a "little house" under four pillows, so it was hard to hear them! Riku loves to make up little scenarios with his stuffed friends, and we have great fun talking back and forth for them all. </p>
<p>Once he was up he painted with the brushes, and then went right to the sink for some water play with his tin box of animals. Certain ones are allowed in, but not the lizards with wheels or the octopus, as he might eat things, and today the dinosaurs were the "bad guys", growling away at the innocent seals and rabbits and various other animals. </p>
<p>Today he claimed the animals had splashed the tiles behind the sink and he asked if I was angry with them. This has been a big thing these days; he likes to say he is angry with someone or sometimes everyone! I think it gives him a certain sense of power to use these words. At one point when I told him I was a little sad he was angry with me, he answered "Oh, I not angry with you, Nana. I just angry with everyone else!" He also told me in the car that he wasn't really angry, that "I only pretending Nana". </p>
<p>Riku now frequently tells me quite out of the blue that "I love you very very much" and gives impulsive hugs and demands extra ones when we are parting at the end of the day. </p>
<p>The rain stopped around 4 p.m., and at 4:45 we headed off to the drugstore to put in his prescription for this nagging cough. The promise of splashing in puddles made it easier to give up his time splashing in the sink. </p>
<p>I sent out lots of darling Mirei/Riku photos yesterday from Mari, and today had lots of wonderful emails telling me how adorable/chunky/Buddah-like, delicious, and amazing she is. Two people told me that they thought they had had the chunkiest babies until they saw Mirei's photos. That belly! Mari told me that when Riku looked at her belly on Sunday, all roundy and bare, he asked, "She have a baby in there?" Now that's chunky! </p>
<p>Bryn was here when we arrived home from our leisurely stroll and splash in the puddles; I quickly made Riku some dinner and sent them on their way with a little of Susan's delicious cheesecake from Kevin's party last night. I indulged in the doggy-bag goodies Susan sent home with me... brochettes of cherry tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella cheese, and basil leaves, as well as tofu and tomato brochettes. Yum! </p>
<p>Riku gave me extra hugs goodbye as I walked them downstairs at 6:50. The amazing long and thick contrail/cloud we had seen earlier had disappeared and we had lovely big fluffy clouds to admire. Riku is a sky-watcher and I think he gets that from both his daddy and me. We  often comment on the moon, or stars, or clouds to him, and now he pays attention himself. </p>
<p>That is one sweet boy! Today, looking just a little bit shy about it, and at his daddy's request, he demonstrated both the boys bow and the girls curtsies that he learned in school yesterday. Bryn thinks it is for part of a program they are putting together; I hope I am here to see it. </p>
<p>Tonight... answered lots of short emails, sent out a few more photos, and cleaned up the kitchen... the day was busy. Talked with Doug briefly too; I had missed his call last night due to my late arrival home.</p>
