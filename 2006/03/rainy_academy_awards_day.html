								<h2>Rainy Academy Awards Day</h2>
								<p>It's a blowy blustery day, with rain expected later on. Bryn dropped in with Mirei about 10 a.m. He had work to do and we had some time with Mirei while Riku spent the morning with Akane. Mirei gave us a few smiles, and then cried hard for a little while, until dropping off into a good solid sleep upstairs on my knees. Doug finished showering and got caught up in watching two Oprah tapes with me; she was interviewing Oscar nominees and former winners. It was lovely watching Mirei sighing and shifting while the morning puttered away so quietly. </p>
<p>After a little chatting time with her Grandpa, and then a diaper change, Mirei went home with her dad for lunch at noon hour. Doug and I had lunch too, did some emailing, and left the house at 2:30 for Mill Valley to see Anne Hills in concert at 3:30. By then it was raining quite hard and during the concert the rain was really teeming down. The church was a beautiful setting for Anne Hills' lovely songs and there was a good turn-out for the benefit concert. </p>
<p>The trip home was not fun at all, as the rain was coming down so hard, traffic was heavy and slowed-down, with lots of huge puddles to drive through all the way across the Bay Bridge. Once in the city the rain was much lighter, but it was later than we expected to be home, almost 7 p.m. </p>
<p>However, the house was busy and smelled good, as Susan, Kevin, and Amelia had come over to watch the Oscar ceremony too, bringing Chinese take-out with them for dinner. Doug settled in, Susan made us up two big bowls of delicious food, and I watched Amelia and her antics along with the award ceremony. Amelia was having a great time, with her own movie playing on a wee DVD player, jumping off the bed, and having some tub time. She had had a good two-hour nap today, and was in fine spirits despite the late hour. </p>
<p>We saw the big coup of the evening, with the Canadian-directed movie "Crash" winning for best picture. After Susan and family left around 9 p.m. Doug and I watched the entire first half of the show, or at least the parts we chose to see, on the tape he had set up before we left this afternoon. Reese Witherspoon won best actress for "Walk the Line", Philip Seymour Hoffman for best actor for "Capote", and best supporting went to Rachel Weiss for "The Constant Gardener" and George Clooney for "Syriana". Ang Lee took the director's award for "Brokeback Mountain". Bedtime immediately followed as my eyes were heavy watching the final bits of the extras. </p>
<p>Two more days until Bryn and Caillie arrive!</p>
