								<h2>Big Kisseroos</h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 6:20 a.m. today, and so did I! It's always so sweet to see that little face peering at me, and then acknowledging that I am awake and ready to do his bidding. Riku coughed twice in the night, quite hard and prolonged each time, but this was his first day in a long time with no fever at all. Hope is on the horizon! </p>
<p>After snuggling for a bit, and playing with his newly discovered and now-much-favoured mouse hand puppet, we got up and got out the paint brushes and squirt paint bottles that Riku spotted. He was quite pleased with them, and I was very impressed at how organized he was with it all. He carefully put each brush into a container I had given him, and when repeating the colours would choose the correct one, never, for instance, ever using the "green" brush for the "red" paint. Riku had very definite ideas about how much area he wanted to cover and when he wanted to make brush strokes and when he wanted to just fill in an area. He painted twice today, and my French doors are quickly filling up with original works of art by him and Amelia. </p>
<p>Riku watched Caillou today; I love to sit beside him and watch him enjoying this program. Kelly and Gregg gave him a big book of Caillou stories, and we gave him many paperbacks too, so he knows most of the little scenarios he sees on the half-hour program. He smiles away when Caillou interacts with his friends, or when he is trying to cope with "monsters" in his bedroom. It's a sweet program and makes this little boy very happy. </p>
<p>It was a crazy day weather-wise, with black clouds, and brilliant sunshine in between dry and wet spells. However, at 10:30 we went off to the Mariposa playground just for some fresh air. Riku sat in the sandbox playing with his bigger trucks that we took along with us today, and we dashed back to the car when the raindrops started. By the time we got home, a mere five minutes later, the sun was out and we took time to splash in puddles across the street, and pick a lemon from the tree across the way. Riku was delighted with this and we will go out with Grandpa and Bryn soon to pick some that are too high for me to reach. </p>
<p>Nap time from 1-4 today. I know he would have slept longer if I had snuggled him, but Bryn says he may go to school tomorrow, which means he must be in bed at a decent hour tonight. He was a bit grumbly about my leaving the door open and turning off the sound machine, but was soon making the mouse "talk" to me and giving me the biggest kisses, on my nose(!) and my cheeks. What a smoochy guy he is! He holds my face between his hands so often now, and really cuddles up. </p>
<p>I phoned Toronto and talked with all four children, speaking first with Bryn and Caillie who are very excited about their trip here tomorrow! We discussed where we might eat lunch tomorrow and plan to make up our list of things to do while they're here. They may write in their journals on the plane, and we will do our best to keep up with that. We have trip journals going all the way back to their visit to England six years ago; it's not always their favourite activity but one I know they will be happy they did once they are adults. </p>
<p>Snacks followed while Riku watched some of his snowplowing video, but he soon was down on the floor playing "firemen" with me, using his blocks and fireman pieces from Bryn. He didn't want to get dressed after his nap, which was unusual, but the upstairs was warm and sunny, and he looked very cute sitting on the floor in his Superman underwear and that little chest of his on view. </p>
<p>Doug left for his T'ai Chi class around 6:40 and Bryn was here soon after that to pick up Riku. He was a little teary and dragging his heels about going, as well as trying to convince his dad that he needed to make a "big studio" in his room. Apparently, this means getting out all of his toys and filling his room with them, something that is not popular with his parents. They were working on a compromise as we went down the stairs to the car. It was windy and rather than draw a bit with the chalk, as he intended to do before leaving, he "drove" the car for a few minutes instead. </p>
<p>Bryn told me that Riku woke up two nights ago saying "Nana not wave to me in the car!", quite upset about it. He went back to sleep right away, but Bryn suggested that I not merely make sure that I wave when they have pulled out of the driveway but to be aware that Riku may be waving while they are still sitting there! I was very careful about it tonight, staying in the driveway until they left, and getting a "thumbs up" from Riku for my efforts. </p>
<p>Upstairs to watch a retrospective program on the Fawlty Towers series after Doug arrived home; I dozed off... not surprised at all. Emails, and bed at 11:35 tonight. </p>
<p>One more day!! How this time has flown; Bryn and Caillie arrive at 10:30 a.m.!</p>
