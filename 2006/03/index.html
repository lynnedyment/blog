								<h2><a href="/2006/03/thursday_already_1.html">Thursday Already!</a></h2>
								<p>How this week flew by! It was one of the busiest weeks ever so that no doubt explains it. Woke to a cold sunny day, which is a treat, as it is expected to be rainy and grey for the rest of it. After answering some emails, I dashed off to pick Riku up at 1o a.m. Spent a little time admiring Mirei who was busy nursing and then just lying serenely in her mommy's arms, looking around her. What a beautiful girl she is! </p>
<p>Riku greeted me at the door by saying "I just watching a movie and it's almost over, okay? Then I will come to your house" and later on said "Come and see my studio (which is what he calls his bedroom); I have many toys in there!" and he does. </p>
<p>He had an egg and some toast to eat, but wouldn't take even one bite of it, so after a few more moments with Mirei, off we went. I had driven over so that we could go to the playground for some fresh air and still get home in time for an early nap. I had a doctor's appointment for my annual physical, long overdue by years!, and we needed to leave the house at 3:30 p.m. </p>
<p>Riku didn't play at the playground, not even sitting in the sandbox... a first, but he did seem to enjoy watching three other children play nearby. We stayed for a half hour, as he needed some fresh air, but headed off for "Nana's house". Riku had a temperature and was feeling quite warm; he didn't want to play with Play-Doh or do any drawing but did want to go upstairs after sweetly tucking his squirrel into his own bed. He is going to be such a good daddy, as he wrapped squirrel up in a towel (his tail got a little wet coming up the stairs... "it's okay, it's okay" murmured Riku to him), turned on the sound machine, and quietly closed the door. </p>
<p>Off we went with a "picnic" tray... a sandwich and hot chocolate for me, and a whole orange for Riku in segments, a tiny cup of hot chocolate, and a waffle. He ate a good bit of it, but that little body was just so hot. Tuck in time at 12:15 and he was asleep at 12:20. Perfect! </p>
<p>I took the monitor upstairs and finished off the end of this week's ironing, and then sat and watched a taped Oprah show, calling Doug up to see the cast of one of our current favourite tv shows "Grey's Anatomy", as well as the puppeteer and voice of Elmo. </p>
<p>Riku woke a few times but was easily coaxed back to sleep, but his body was hot, and I'm sure he wasn't comfortable. His coughing seems a little less frequent and I gave him his third "puffer" of medicine before he went to bed. I hope this works although he does have an appointment with Dr. Steele on Monday.</p>
<p>He would easily have gone back to sleep again at 2:50, as he dozed off in my arms, but I needed to leave for the doctor's at 3:30. Poor wee guy. Two hours of sleep just wasn't quite enough for him. However, after dressing him and getting out to the car, he was in good spirits. Doug dropped me off at the doctor's, he and Riku walked along the street for a bit admiring all the dogs out being walked,</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/03/rainy_academy_awards_day.html">Rainy Academy Awards Day</a></h2>
								<p>It's a blowy blustery day, with rain expected later on. Bryn dropped in with Mirei about 10 a.m. He had work to do and we had some time with Mirei while Riku spent the morning with Akane. Mirei gave us a few smiles, and then cried hard for a little while, until dropping off into a good solid sleep upstairs on my knees. Doug finished showering and got caught up in watching two Oprah tapes with me; she was interviewing Oscar nominees and former winners. It was lovely watching Mirei sighing and shifting while the morning puttered away so quietly. </p>
<p>After a little chatting time with her Grandpa, and then a diaper change, Mirei went home with her dad for lunch at noon hour. Doug and I had lunch too, did some emailing, and left the house at 2:30 for Mill Valley to see Anne Hills in concert at 3:30. By then it was raining quite hard and during the concert the rain was really teeming down. The church was a beautiful setting for Anne Hills' lovely songs and there was a good turn-out for the benefit concert. </p>
<p>The trip home was not fun at all, as the rain was coming down so hard, traffic was heavy and slowed-down, with lots of huge puddles to drive through all the way across the Bay Bridge. Once in the city the rain was much lighter, but it was later than we expected to be home, almost 7 p.m. </p>
<p>However, the house was busy and smelled good, as Susan, Kevin, and Amelia had come over to watch the Oscar ceremony too, bringing Chinese take-out with them for dinner. Doug settled in, Susan made us up two big bowls of delicious food, and I watched Amelia and her antics along with the award ceremony. Amelia was having a great time, with her own movie playing on a wee DVD player, jumping off the bed, and having some tub time. She had had a good two-hour nap today, and was in fine spirits despite the late hour. </p>
<p>We saw the big coup of the evening, with the Canadian-directed movie "Crash" winning for best picture. After Susan and family left around 9 p.m. Doug and I watched the entire first half of the show, or at least the parts we chose to see, on the tape he had set up before we left this afternoon. Reese Witherspoon won best actress for "Walk the Line", Philip Seymour Hoffman for best actor for "Capote", and best supporting went to Rachel Weiss for "The Constant Gardener" and George Clooney for "Syriana". Ang Lee took the director's award for "Brokeback Mountain". Bedtime immediately followed as my eyes were heavy watching the final bits of the extras. </p>
<p>Two more days until Bryn and Caillie arrive!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/03/big_kisseroos.html">Big Kisseroos</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 6:20 a.m. today, and so did I! It's always so sweet to see that little face peering at me, and then acknowledging that I am awake and ready to do his bidding. Riku coughed twice in the night, quite hard and prolonged each time, but this was his first day in a long time with no fever at all. Hope is on the horizon! </p>
<p>After snuggling for a bit, and playing with his newly discovered and now-much-favoured mouse hand puppet, we got up and got out the paint brushes and squirt paint bottles that Riku spotted. He was quite pleased with them, and I was very impressed at how organized he was with it all. He carefully put each brush into a container I had given him, and when repeating the colours would choose the correct one, never, for instance, ever using the "green" brush for the "red" paint. Riku had very definite ideas about how much area he wanted to cover and when he wanted to make brush strokes and when he wanted to just fill in an area. He painted twice today, and my French doors are quickly filling up with original works of art by him and Amelia. </p>
<p>Riku watched Caillou today; I love to sit beside him and watch him enjoying this program. Kelly and Gregg gave him a big book of Caillou stories, and we gave him many paperbacks too, so he knows most of the little scenarios he sees on the half-hour program. He smiles away when Caillou interacts with his friends, or when he is trying to cope with "monsters" in his bedroom. It's a sweet program and makes this little boy very happy. </p>
<p>It was a crazy day weather-wise, with black clouds, and brilliant sunshine in between dry and wet spells. However, at 10:30 we went off to the Mariposa playground just for some fresh air. Riku sat in the sandbox playing with his bigger trucks that we took along with us today, and we dashed back to the car when the raindrops started. By the time we got home, a mere five minutes later, the sun was out and we took time to splash in puddles across the street, and pick a lemon from the tree across the way. Riku was delighted with this and we will go out with Grandpa and Bryn soon to pick some that are too high for me to reach. </p>
<p>Nap time from 1-4 today. I know he would have slept longer if I had snuggled him, but Bryn says he may go to school tomorrow, which means he must be in bed at a decent hour tonight. He was a bit grumbly about my leaving the door open and turning off the sound machine, but was soon making the mouse "talk" to me and giving me the biggest kisses, on my nose(!) and my cheeks. What a smoochy guy he is! He holds my face between his hands so often now, and really cuddles up. </p>
<p>I phoned Toronto and talked with all four children, speaking first with Bryn and Caillie who are very excited about their trip here tomorrow! We discussed where we might eat lunch tomorrow and plan to make up our list of things to do while they're here. They may write in their journals on the plane, and we will do our best to keep up with that. We have trip journals going all the way back to their visit to England six years ago; it's not always their favourite activity but one I know they will be happy they did once they are adults. </p>
<p>Snacks followed while Riku watched some of his snowplowing video, but he soon was down on the floor playing "firemen" with me, using his blocks and fireman pieces from Bryn. He didn't want to get dressed after his nap, which was unusual, but the upstairs was warm and sunny, and he looked very cute sitting on the floor in his Superman underwear and that little chest of his on view. </p>
<p>Doug left for his T'ai Chi class around 6:40 and Bryn was here soon after that to pick up Riku. He was a little teary and dragging his heels about going, as well as trying to convince his dad that he needed to make a "big studio" in his room. Apparently, this means getting out all of his toys and filling his room with them, something that is not popular with his parents. They were working on a compromise as we went down the stairs to the car. It was windy and rather than draw a bit with the chalk, as he intended to do before leaving, he "drove" the car for a few minutes instead. </p>
<p>Bryn told me that Riku woke up two nights ago saying "Nana not wave to me in the car!", quite upset about it. He went back to sleep right away, but Bryn suggested that I not merely make sure that I wave when they have pulled out of the driveway but to be aware that Riku may be waving while they are still sitting there! I was very careful about it tonight, staying in the driveway until they left, and getting a "thumbs up" from Riku for my efforts. </p>
<p>Upstairs to watch a retrospective program on the Fawlty Towers series after Doug arrived home; I dozed off... not surprised at all. Emails, and bed at 11:35 tonight. </p>
<p>One more day!! How this time has flown; Bryn and Caillie arrive at 10:30 a.m.!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/03/bryn_and_caillie_in_san_franci.html">Bryn and Caillie in San Francisco!</a></h2>
								<p>After awakening several times in the night, calculating just what Bryn and Caillie would be doing at that precise moment, I finally gave up and got up at 6:30... when they would have been on the second plane, bound from Chicago to us in San Francisco! </p>
<p>We left in lots of time to get to San Jose International, and then ran into horrific traffic, stopped completely at times, just outside Menlo Park. There had been an accident and we crawled along for more than forty minutes; I tried very hard to just concentrate on listening to NPR and not worry about something I couldn't help. It was still hard to keep visions of these two children showing up with their attendant, with no Nana or Grandpa anywhere in sight! Finally, the traffic cleared and we parked at the airport at 10:31, just a few minutes after they had landed. We knew they would be last off the plane and dashed inside, to wait, thank goodness, about fifteen minutes for them. </p>
<p>Caillie spotted me first, and Bryn was right behind her; they looked terrific, excited and bursting with details about how their flight had gone (first time with no adult accompanying them), about the movie they saw, and how kind the attendants had been who took them to their plane in Toronto and then off the plane in Chicago, and on to the San Jose flight... and finally to us. While we were waiting for their luggage, a fellow our age came up and told us what well-behaved grandchildren we had. Of course we know that, but it was still nice to hear. Caillie had the window seat on the way here, on both planes, and so Bryn will have it on the way back. Interesting arrangement... </p>
<p>Off to "Fresh Choice" for lunch, one of the three restaurants on their list of places to eat. Bryn had a wee bit of salad, a few bites of hard boiled egg, grated carrot, a couple of cucumber slices, and some croutons, filling up on pizza slices and a muffin, for the second course, followed by some jello, and finally a dish of soft vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce, the real reason that he and Grandpa like "Fresh Choice". </p>
<p>Caillie filled her plate up with lots of dark greens, croutons, a tuna pasta, carrots, peas and corn, eating a little of most of the items, but not the tuna. I was happy to finish off hers; Kelly and I both like the tuna tarragon dish here. And then Miss Caillie had a cone of plain vanilla ice cream, followed by a dish of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles and caramel sauce and then assured me she was still hungry and sure could use another wee dish of it. Hey, she's on holiday so off she went, happily dishing up the sprinkles!.. and more sauce. </p>
<p>We made a couple of stops... for some Acme sourdough bread, some fresh fruit, a book store for Doug (we compiled our list of things-to-do while he was browsing), and finally a car washt, where we ate freshly popped popcorn and drank lemonade (free of charge, but where did we find room for it!?), and a one-cent pony ride for Caillie. She seemed a little embarrassed to be riding on this pretend horse, but really I think she liked it, but didn't want to appear to do so. </p>
<p>Brynnie was really tired, and curled up with a blanket and a head rest of Riku's, while Caillie rolled her window all the way down, stuck her head as close to it as she could, opened her mouth and took in all the breeze she could; she looked like a very happy dog, with her hair blowing and making happy puppy sounds. It was very funny and I snapped a couple of photos. </p>
<p>Kelly called on Skype almost as soon as we stepped in the door, to get all the news on their solo trip. Hans and Uncle Mark called later on as well. </p>
<p>We unpacked as soon as we got home, and while I put the bags away after resorting the ski and winter clothes into them, Bryn spent some time on the computer, IM'ing with friends. I have never heard anything like it... he logged on and almost instantly there were about six kids on there writing to him! One of them even "chatted" with Uncle Bryn for a few lines, when he got on to say "hello". </p>
<p>Not too much later we went off for a walk to Hampshire Street. Bryn had told Brynnie that Riku hadn't fallen asleep until 3 p.m. and awoke an hour later; Mirei was nursing and Riku would have needed a little help dozing off, so up he got. </p>
<p>The children were so anxious to see him, and to meet Mirei, and wanted a walk too. We arrived about 4:30, they both cooed away at Mirei, and got Riku smiling and agreeing to come over here to play with them for a while. He was tired enough that he wanted to sit in the stroller though, much to my surprise. It was windy and I covered him with a blanket which he happily kept tucked in around him. </p>
<p>Caillie pushed him the entire way home, even up the little hill on the next street down, and engaged Riku the entire way, asking if he wanted her to go fast or slow and making him laugh. We stopped across the street so that Caillie could climb the lemon tree to pick a lemon for Riku! He was delighted with it, but told her it was too sour and he wouldn't eat it. </p>
<p>The three of them played so happily, upstairs and downstairs, with Riku showing them all his toys, and so happy to be with them. It was really sweet to see; these two children are so good with little ones and Riku was at ease immediately with all their attention. </p>
<p>Bryn, Akane, and Mirei arrived about 5:45, and Mirei sat in her car seat on the kitchen counter, smiling at the fuzzy black and white chicken and at me when I stopped for some eye contact. Bryn had her chatting away at him, making noises at her, to which she responded so intently. </p>
<p>I made up a quick dinner of pasta with "meat" sauce, tossed a salad, and Bryn cut the bread for the table. Doug had left for his PEA meeting in the East Bay so there were six of us for dinner; it was fun for Riku again having both children paying so much attention to him and all his silly antics, even at the table, but it was soon over. Bryn was determined to get him home by 7 p.m. for an early bedtime tonight, so we waved goodbye at 6:55.  </p>
<p>Brynnie had a headache due to not enough water (his thought), so he  went upstairs to relax on our bed, watching some TV and just vegging out.. and drinking lots of water. Caillie joined him, but man did that girl eat! They both ate small portions of pasta and salad for dinner, but then Caillie ate a slice of bread, and then had another, which I toasted and took up for her, along with half a banana. And she was still hungry, so ate a small bowl of cereal and drank some milk! </p>
<p>They were both in bed at 8 p.m. (11 body time though), and I don't think either of them heard the last five pages of "The Lorax". </p>
<p>Tidied the kitchen, did some emailing, and am about to head off to bed at 10:30. Now that the children are here, I can stop imagining them going to the airport, getting on the plane, just taking off, etc., etc.  Night night...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/03/go_back_to_the_kitchen_nana.html">"Go Back to the Kitchen, Nana."</a></h2>
								<p>Riku awoke at 6:30 this morning, and Bryn and Caillie just minutes later. This gave them two hours together before Bryn arrived to take Riku to school. They had a grand ol' time, playing cars on the bed, reading in the living room, doing a little drawing in Riku's "studio" (the little table in the kitchen), and tossing a ball back and forth. Riku did a great job, as Bryn tossed it a little high, and that gave Riku time to reach up and grab it. </p>
<p>We all went downstairs with Riku at 8:20 so he could draw a bit with chalk before heading off to school. Our plan was to get out of the house as early as possible and we did well... everyone had breakfast earlier but me, and Caillie had kindly made not only her bed this morning, but Bryn's and ours as well! </p>
<p>We caught the 9:15 bus to Market Street, which proved to be an interesting if eye-opening ride for Bryn and me, at least. There were two women on the bus, speaking loudly and with very "colorful" language about how their paroles were worked out, and whether one had to serve more than 60 days for a misdemeanor, or more than six months, as the other claimed she did! I don't take the bus very often, but I guess there are lessons to be learned. </p>
<p>Luckily, we immediately caught a street car, which took us to Powell Street. Caillie wanted to go in and ride up on the curving escalotor at the SF Centre; Bryn really didn't, but went along for her sake. This is happening a lot this trip; they both have different opinions about what is important to them. For instance, Caillie would love to walk across the Golden Gate Bridge, but Bryn doesn't this time. However there are also many things that they do agree on... such as the trip to Santa Cruz, and visiting Ellen in Cupertino, which surprised me. </p>
<p>There was no line-up for the cable car, but we waited for the car that took us to Ghirardelli Square rather than Pier 39, preferring to take the more scenic route. We decided to walk directly to Pier 39 just in case the rain started later, as we expected it to. Of course, the "bush man" was out, but they are on to him, and looking for him, so he just waved at us as we went by. The sea lions were next, and to our shock, we saw a dead sea lion hanging over the edge of one of the floats. It really looked as though it was dozing at first glance, but it was just too still, and quite a crowd had collected to watch it, and discuss it. </p>
<p>The children decided they were too old for the carousel(!), and so we wandered through the shop area, stopping to look at a shell shop, and then on to "Johnny Rockets" for lunch. They remembered they had eaten there last year with their Mom, Gregg, Myk', and Bry', and both agreed they would like to go again. Caillie has a bit of a sore throat and is not feeling up to snuff so she was happy to sit down for a while, relax, and get warm. This is a little girl who is always hot, so I knew she really wasn't feeling well. We had both gargled with salt water this morning before we left the house. </p>
<p>Back at Ghirardelli Square, we went searching for a little rabbit character that Bry' had lost in Las Vegas in the fall. Caillie was on a quest to find another just like it, but they are being discontinued and she decided on the newer version, hoping he will like it. She did a little extra shopping for others too. What a thoughtful child she is, looking for exactly the right thing for everyone, including the cats and the dogs! </p>
<p>Doug picked us up, as planned, at 12:35 to drive to Riku's school for him. Once again his face lit up as he spotted his cousins and he proudly pointed out the calendar he had made. He told me he ate all his lunch, and then ate his oranges really quickly too! The children were great as they kept things nice and low-key, both in the car and at home, during his "just ten minutes playtime for the timer" before his nap. </p>
<p>Bryn wrote in his journal while Riku napped, and then played some computer games after finishing up the dough we started yesterday. He basically did it all, the sifting and the measuring, and it's now in the fridge to be rolled, when we have a quiet hour together. He also made orange juice for us all, and chatted with his friends on MSN for quite a while. Uncle Bryn was part of the group of four he was on with at the same time! UB was trying to determine what the plans for tomorrow are... as it's his birthday! </p>
<p>Riku slept for two-plus hours, and when I went in and asked if he was ready to get up he cried and said "I not <strong>want</strong> to wake up yet" and went back to sleep for fifteen minutes. I left the door open and when we heard him next, the children went in quietly to him, until he started smiling and interacting with them.  </p>
<p>They so badly wanted to go to the playground with both Amelia and Riku after naps today, but Susan had written to say Amelia had not napped long enough and would be getting into her night routine very early today, and Riku just wanted to stay put and play with Play-Doh and them, of course! What good cousins they are; I knew they were disappointed at staying in all afternoon, but they sat so patiently at the table with Riku, making all sorts of things and keeping him company. </p>
<p>Finally, he was willing to play something else, and when I walked in the bedroom to see what they were doing, Riku looked at me and said in no uncertain tones "Go back to the kitchen, Nana." I used to be his best bud', his favourite "gorl", his constant compadre... but not now! However, I must say he always wants a big hug when we part, so all is not lost. </p>
<p>Doug and the children left at 6 p.m. to pick up some groceries at Rainbow, and to get the two half-baked pizzas from Amici's restaurant. This is on their lists, and tonight is traditionally pizza and movie night in Toronto. Doug had rented a movie he thought they would like so we had our plans all set for the evening. </p>
<p>Bryn came in for Riku just as they were leaving, but Riku wanted the same book Bryn had been reading to him earlier read to him twice... and then wanted his big hug before we all went down to look at the moon and the big storm clouds. </p>
<p>The pizzas were great and I made up a big plate of raw veggies to go with them. I decided not to watch the movie, but to get busy making the fillings for the quiche shells I had started earlier. There was a big boom of thunder and I called to see if Riku had heard it; we are both very fond of thunder and lightning, although it's such a rare experience for Riku that most of his expertise comes from pictures on Grandpa's computer. However, he told me he had heard it, and I hope he saw some lighting too... </p>
<p>Late bedtime for the children as the movie was a long one; they turned out their light at 9:15. Tomorrow they will be in bed at a more regular time for certain; Caillie especially needs it right now. </p>
<p>I made three quiche fillings... broccoli, mushroom and spinach, and a tomato-basil filling of Sandy's, for which she kindly sent me the recipe not long after I had asked for it tonight. </p>
<p>Cleaned up, wrote a few emails, annotated the photos from today, which Doug had put up, and off I go to bed... 11:50... too late. Busy day tomorrow I know... there is a birthday cake to make! </p>
<p>Happy Birthday, in remembrance of my Dad. 1917-1987</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/03/happy_birthday_bryn_2.html">Happy Birthday, Bryn!</a></h2>
								<p>Thirty-eight years ago I gave birth to a beautiful red-haired baby boy. Each year, on my birthday, after I was grown and had left home, my Mom would call me and tell me about the day I was born. When Bryn called yesterday about when they would be picking the children up for breakfast, I told him that he was just eight hours old at that point, all those years ago, and what an easy baby he had been to deliver. I took a cab to the hospital (Doug was in Calgary on business, and Gram was there to watch Kelly for me), and we arrived at midnight on a cold, wintry, and icy Ottawa night. Bryn made his appearance a mere three hours later, at 3:13 a.m. No hard labour, no stitches, just a healthy 7 pounds 13-1/2 ounce baby boy. His birth completed our family of a girl and a boy. How interesting that both Kelly and Bryn have a boy and a girl as well; lucky us! </p>
<p>It was a busy day here, well captured in photos, so I shall make this brief (Ha! Ha!)... Uncle Bryn, Akane, Riku, Auntie Susan, Kevin, and Amelia invited Caillie and Bryn to "Just for You" for breakfast. This is a favourite brekkie place for us in Potrero Hill, specializing in homemade bread and beignets. Both children loved the latter, so I will take them back once more before they leave; I stayed home with sweet Mirei, who slept a little and played on the bed for a good long while.</p>
<p>Lunch at home, and there was time for two games of Aces; Caillie won both games and was delighted! Caillie had a little nap as she was feeling quite cold, a sure sign that our "hot girl" was not feeling well. I gave her a sweater Mom had made for me, and she finally warmed up.   </p>
<p>Uncle Bryn picked up the children at 2 p.m. for a mini-golf session in  the south Bay. They were gone for three hours and had a great time; the two Bryns tied with a score of 66 and Caillie got 76. Brynnie got a hole-in-one and two two-strokes!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back home, Doug was busy running birthday errands and I was taking care of Riku, who was supposed to have a nap here, but instead had it in the car at 11:30 with his parents. He needed more sleep but wasn't quite ready to give in as early as three p.m. He played happily making "dinner" with Play-Doh and all the dishes from his kitchen piled on the table. </p>
<p>Dinner was ready by 5 p.m.: three quiches, a big tray of olives, hummous, boiled eggs, roasted red peppers, tortilla chips and salsa, and wheat crackers, as well as carrot and celery sticks, and two baguettes. We set up the children's play table in the dining room, where Bryn, Caillie, and Amelia sat right next to us at the big table. </p>
<p>By 5:45 everyone was here... Akane, Bryn, Mirei, and Riku (who had gone out for the little drive home to pick up his mom and sister), Susan, Kevin, and Amelia, and then Brent and Mari. </p>
<p>Mirei smiled at everyone... Kevin entertained her for a while, Susan held her, and the rest of us enjoyed her sweet personality, but soon she was tired and cried harder than any of us have ever heard her; I'm sure it didn't help that there was lots of noise, attention, and light everywhere. We all took turns trying to soothe her, and finally Akane managed to, nursing in a dark bedroom. Akane joined us for cheesecake, Amelia had a bath, and Riku and the children played in the hallway with the train. Busy, busy day, but it was lots of fun. </p>
<p>Everyone left around 8:15 p.m. Caillie's throat was still quite sore,  so she gargled for the third time with salt water, and was tucked into bed by 8:45. Bryn and I played two games of "Go Fish" and he was in bed by 9:10. </p>
<p>Doug put today's photos into the online album, I cleaned up the kitchen and dining room, and finally annotated the photos. That was the end of my day; I was tired and ready for sleep when I headed up at 11 p.m. Managed to read until 11:45 though, much to my surprise.</p>

								<p>Bryn woke up just before 8 a.m. today, and Caillie came tumbling out shortly after. Her throat is pretty sore this morning, and so she gargled with salt water first thing, and made up a glass for me too. My throat is fine, but there may be a few bugs lurking in there! </p>
<p>Caillie was the juice girl today and squeezed big glasses for all of us. Bryn had a fried egg with sourdough for breakfast, Caillie tried and didn't like a poached egg, and had toast and bacon instead. She sat and made a picture for her Dad and Uncle Mark, and the cats at their house, and had a little time on the computer. Bryn had the computer buzzing away with three or four IM conversations going on at once(!) ... and he plays with his Game Boy between breaks! </p>
<p>It was a grey and drizzly day here, but I assured them it wouldn't rain in Santa Cruz, and hoped I was right. We left at 10:40, much later that I had hoped to, but with the weather the way it was, there seemed to be no rush. We saw snow at the top of the mountain going into Santa Cruz! It was on the sides of the roads and in the trees, but it was also raining hard, and by the time we drove back home had pretty much disappeared. </p>
<p>Into "Trader Joe's for a few grocery supplies, and then walked a couple of stores down for lunch at "Erik's Deli", a spot we have eaten in before. Bryn, much to my surprise, ordered chili in a sourdough bowl, and ate most of it. Caillie ordered a turkey sandwich, plain, with the turkey on the side, but didn't eat more than a bite of two of it; I think she was expecting "real" turkey and not the thin processed type. Fortunately, there was a little dog outside, who was more than happy to accept Caillie's offer of her lunch and she chatted with the owner for a few minutes. And, just as I had predicted, while we were eating the sun came out! </p>
<p>Found a spot very close by the Boardwalk on the pier, and learned a few minutes later why it was so easy to park; all the rides on the Boardwalk were closed! Doug had checked their Web site before leaving, and they should have been open, but perhaps because of the cold weather, the owners had decided not to bother. We were certainly disappointed, but made the best of it... went for a walk on the beach, and spent a good hour or more in the arcade. The children each bought $10 worth of tokens, played all the machines that caught their eyes, and revelled in those long streams of paper coupons that roll out on a good hit. Caillie won over 300 of them and Bryn in the high 200s, and so they got to spend fifteen minutes carefully choosing their "prizes"... battery-run fans that spin out colours, two plastic wrenches, rings, and various other goodies. </p>
<p>On the drive home, it started to rain again, with menacing black clouds all around us, but we stopped in Los Gatos and discovered a Cold Stone Creamery, a first for the children. Bryn had a lemon sorbet with a Twix bar cut into it, and Caillie a chocolate ice cream, also with a Twix bar. </p>
<p>On we drove, deciding to stop at a Krispy Kreme doughnut place on the way home. It's on the children's to-do list, after all. We were lucky enough to be there as they came hot off the line, so each got a sample, and then we ordered a dozen to bring home and freeze. Heaven for the kids, they told us. </p>
<p>Another to-do was to see the hang gliders, which we had missed out on last year. It was raining off and on, though, with dark clouds, but we decided to take a chance and go anyway. We were thrilled to see two gliders up and running, and later on a remote-controlled one too. It was cool and breezy there, but the children ran from the viewpoint to the spot where they take off, so it was well worthwhile. </p>
<p>Our plan for the evening was to watch a video borrowed from Riku, so we stopped in on our way home for a quick visit. Brent was there, playing with Riku in the bedroom, but Bryn and Caillie soon joined him and had some playtime together. Riku's version of "Howl's Moving Castle" is in Japanese, so that was disappointing. We came home for dinner, leftover pizza with lots of veggies and a fruit plate for the children, and pasta for the grandparents. Dessert for the children was a Krispy Kreme doughnut. </p>
<p>They chatted with Kelly and heard all about Bryant's skiing day with Uncle Mark; we then had a game of Aces, which Caillie won once again... and bedtime was at 8:30 for a tired and coughing Caillie, and 9 p.m. for Brynnie.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/03/twentyseven_days_of_rain_in_ma.html">Twenty-Seven Days of Rain in March... so far!</a></h2>
								<p>I spent the rainy morning in the house, writing emails but mostly talking on the phone, catching up with Amelia from Niagara Falls and with Tay, my former SF friend, now living in Everett, Washington. She's in town for a week or so, and we made plans to get together soon. In no time I seemed to be heading off for Riku's pick-up at 1 p.m. It was raining so hard that his teacher carried him out to the car, holding a large umbrella over both of them! </p>
<p>As he did on Monday, Riku chatted all the way home. For the second or third time ever (except when someone is in the back seat with him), he didn't have to fight sleep, which is much more relaxing for me, not worrying about whether he will fall asleep minutes from home and his comfortable bed! We have such wonderful conversations these days, and today I heard all about "The Iron Giant" DVD he watched with his daddy last night, as promised. I learned that the giant was a "good guy", that he didn't like guns, that he has a little boy who is his friend and that the movie was "a little bit scary", said with a slightly furrowed brow as he talked about it. </p>
<p>I love the way he often says "You remember that, Nana?" or "Yes'erday we... remember that?" And now "tomorrow" is also part of the discussion as in "maybe tomorrow we will go to 'Melia's playground, remember I play there one day on the winding blue slide?" as we pass by the playground on Oak Street coming home. </p>
<p>Today we read two books... Amelia's loan of "Alexander and the Wind-Up Mouse" which he so enjoys, and "A Colour of His Own". Riku napped for an hour and forty minutes today, although he was coughing quite a bit. I had to go in and settle him a few times and finally snuggled in with him for the last twenty minutes. </p>
<p>When he was ready to awaken, he gave two little snorts. I had my head near his shoulder, so I snorted twice too. He repeated them, I repeated them, and then he laughed out loud and sat up. Riku had slept with three mice animals today, and a little ant-eater (Skippy, his dog is still at his house; he promised to bring it back "tomorrow, okay?"), and wanted to play house with them all. So, we stayed in bed ("Let's snuggle a little while, okay?"), hiding the mice and the ant-eater friend under the pillows in a little nest. He would then use a squeaky voice and ask me to help find the mice; he had them in a "little house" under four pillows, so it was hard to hear them! Riku loves to make up little scenarios with his stuffed friends, and we have great fun talking back and forth for them all. </p>
<p>Once he was up he painted with the brushes, and then went right to the sink for some water play with his tin box of animals. Certain ones are allowed in, but not the lizards with wheels or the octopus, as he might eat things, and today the dinosaurs were the "bad guys", growling away at the innocent seals and rabbits and various other animals. </p>
<p>Today he claimed the animals had splashed the tiles behind the sink and he asked if I was angry with them. This has been a big thing these days; he likes to say he is angry with someone or sometimes everyone! I think it gives him a certain sense of power to use these words. At one point when I told him I was a little sad he was angry with me, he answered "Oh, I not angry with you, Nana. I just angry with everyone else!" He also told me in the car that he wasn't really angry, that "I only pretending Nana". </p>
<p>Riku now frequently tells me quite out of the blue that "I love you very very much" and gives impulsive hugs and demands extra ones when we are parting at the end of the day. </p>
<p>The rain stopped around 4 p.m., and at 4:45 we headed off to the drugstore to put in his prescription for this nagging cough. The promise of splashing in puddles made it easier to give up his time splashing in the sink. </p>
<p>I sent out lots of darling Mirei/Riku photos yesterday from Mari, and today had lots of wonderful emails telling me how adorable/chunky/Buddah-like, delicious, and amazing she is. Two people told me that they thought they had had the chunkiest babies until they saw Mirei's photos. That belly! Mari told me that when Riku looked at her belly on Sunday, all roundy and bare, he asked, "She have a baby in there?" Now that's chunky! </p>
<p>Bryn was here when we arrived home from our leisurely stroll and splash in the puddles; I quickly made Riku some dinner and sent them on their way with a little of Susan's delicious cheesecake from Kevin's party last night. I indulged in the doggy-bag goodies Susan sent home with me... brochettes of cherry tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella cheese, and basil leaves, as well as tofu and tomato brochettes. Yum! </p>
<p>Riku gave me extra hugs goodbye as I walked them downstairs at 6:50. The amazing long and thick contrail/cloud we had seen earlier had disappeared and we had lovely big fluffy clouds to admire. Riku is a sky-watcher and I think he gets that from both his daddy and me. We  often comment on the moon, or stars, or clouds to him, and now he pays attention himself. </p>
<p>That is one sweet boy! Today, looking just a little bit shy about it, and at his daddy's request, he demonstrated both the boys bow and the girls curtsies that he learned in school yesterday. Bryn thinks it is for part of a program they are putting together; I hope I am here to see it. </p>
<p>Tonight... answered lots of short emails, sent out a few more photos, and cleaned up the kitchen... the day was busy. Talked with Doug briefly too; I had missed his call last night due to my late arrival home.</p>
