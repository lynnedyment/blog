								<h2>Santa Cruz and More</h2>
								<p>Bryn woke up just before 8 a.m. today, and Caillie came tumbling out shortly after. Her throat is pretty sore this morning, and so she gargled with salt water first thing, and made up a glass for me too. My throat is fine, but there may be a few bugs lurking in there! </p>
<p>Caillie was the juice girl today and squeezed big glasses for all of us. Bryn had a fried egg with sourdough for breakfast, Caillie tried and didn't like a poached egg, and had toast and bacon instead. She sat and made a picture for her Dad and Uncle Mark, and the cats at their house, and had a little time on the computer. Bryn had the computer buzzing away with three or four IM conversations going on at once(!) ... and he plays with his Game Boy between breaks! </p>
<p>It was a grey and drizzly day here, but I assured them it wouldn't rain in Santa Cruz, and hoped I was right. We left at 10:40, much later that I had hoped to, but with the weather the way it was, there seemed to be no rush. We saw snow at the top of the mountain going into Santa Cruz! It was on the sides of the roads and in the trees, but it was also raining hard, and by the time we drove back home had pretty much disappeared. </p>
<p>Into "Trader Joe's for a few grocery supplies, and then walked a couple of stores down for lunch at "Erik's Deli", a spot we have eaten in before. Bryn, much to my surprise, ordered chili in a sourdough bowl, and ate most of it. Caillie ordered a turkey sandwich, plain, with the turkey on the side, but didn't eat more than a bite of two of it; I think she was expecting "real" turkey and not the thin processed type. Fortunately, there was a little dog outside, who was more than happy to accept Caillie's offer of her lunch and she chatted with the owner for a few minutes. And, just as I had predicted, while we were eating the sun came out! </p>
<p>Found a spot very close by the Boardwalk on the pier, and learned a few minutes later why it was so easy to park; all the rides on the Boardwalk were closed! Doug had checked their Web site before leaving, and they should have been open, but perhaps because of the cold weather, the owners had decided not to bother. We were certainly disappointed, but made the best of it... went for a walk on the beach, and spent a good hour or more in the arcade. The children each bought $10 worth of tokens, played all the machines that caught their eyes, and revelled in those long streams of paper coupons that roll out on a good hit. Caillie won over 300 of them and Bryn in the high 200s, and so they got to spend fifteen minutes carefully choosing their "prizes"... battery-run fans that spin out colours, two plastic wrenches, rings, and various other goodies. </p>
<p>On the drive home, it started to rain again, with menacing black clouds all around us, but we stopped in Los Gatos and discovered a Cold Stone Creamery, a first for the children. Bryn had a lemon sorbet with a Twix bar cut into it, and Caillie a chocolate ice cream, also with a Twix bar. </p>
<p>On we drove, deciding to stop at a Krispy Kreme doughnut place on the way home. It's on the children's to-do list, after all. We were lucky enough to be there as they came hot off the line, so each got a sample, and then we ordered a dozen to bring home and freeze. Heaven for the kids, they told us. </p>
<p>Another to-do was to see the hang gliders, which we had missed out on last year. It was raining off and on, though, with dark clouds, but we decided to take a chance and go anyway. We were thrilled to see two gliders up and running, and later on a remote-controlled one too. It was cool and breezy there, but the children ran from the viewpoint to the spot where they take off, so it was well worthwhile. </p>
<p>Our plan for the evening was to watch a video borrowed from Riku, so we stopped in on our way home for a quick visit. Brent was there, playing with Riku in the bedroom, but Bryn and Caillie soon joined him and had some playtime together. Riku's version of "Howl's Moving Castle" is in Japanese, so that was disappointing. We came home for dinner, leftover pizza with lots of veggies and a fruit plate for the children, and pasta for the grandparents. Dessert for the children was a Krispy Kreme doughnut. </p>
<p>They chatted with Kelly and heard all about Bryant's skiing day with Uncle Mark; we then had a game of Aces, which Caillie won once again... and bedtime was at 8:30 for a tired and coughing Caillie, and 9 p.m. for Brynnie.</p>
