								<h2>A Most Relaxing Sunday</h2>
								<p>Today was a very relaxing and quiet day around here. It felt like a Sunday from beginning to end, and I took advantage of it and didn't do one productive thing! Bryn had asked us last night if we would like to go for Dim Sum for brunch today, so we had a lazy early morning, both eating lightly, reading the paper, and answering emails. </p>
<p>I had offered to have Mirei here for her morning nap so Bryn popped over with her. When he brought her to the door, she gave me that huge smile and then all four limbs went into overdrive in excitement; she sure knows how to make me feel special! </p>
<p>Mirei is noticing everything now; she looks up to see the bird's head in the stairwell that Doug started pointing out to her last week, she always looks up at the bird mobile in the room when you ask her where it is, and now when asked "Where are the brooms?" she will almost always turn to look at them hanging on the wall beside the table. Being able to make the plastic bus make music is a new treat too; she pushes the buttons and out comes sound! I will have to keep up with this blog or so many fun new experiences of hers will be forgotten.<br />
 <br />
Before her nap, Mirei did have a big bowl of oatmeal and some fruit,  finishing off with water sipped through a straw. She was doing this when I first arrived home three weeks ago, and it still makes me smile to see her do it so well. </p>
<p>Sandy, Doug's sister, had written to me once, after reading a blog about Mirei using a sippy cup for breast milk, telling me that breast- fed babies have a very easy time using a straw. I told Akane right away and apparently she tried it at home and it worked just as Sandy had said it would. I left for Ontario too soon to see her in action, but I must say, to see that little girl lean forward and sip away as though she's always beeen doing it is just adorable! </p>
<p>Then it was nap time; she's just such an easy child to put down for her sleep, the room is dark and quiet, and I get to see that little face when she wakens too!</p>
<p>Bryn stayed on while Mirei slept, peeking in at her in wonder. He just cannot get over how beautiful she is, and with just a soft blanket tucked around her from the waist down, and those chubby arms and chest visible, I completely agree with him! Of course she is a beautiful little girl always, but those arms, and the "bracelets" around them are priceless. She napped for an hour and forty-five minutes. Bryn and I had more time than usual to discuss the school situation for Riku next year, their car dilemma (to buy? lease? new? old?), what the children are doing, and Riku's newfound friendship with the five-year-old girl who lives downstairs from him. He was playing at her apartment early yesterday afternoon, and then she came and played at Riku's while her little sister was napping. </p>
<p>Bryn said he was the sweetest host, showing her his room first... the dialogue was apparently something like: "This is my room, I have lots of toys, come and see my sister, she is very cute, sometimes she touches my toys, there is a spider in this book, do you want to see it... " and on it went. </p>
<p>So, once Mirei was awake and finished with her photo session on the bed, we got two cars organized for the trip to the Richmond District... Brent loaned his car to Bryn (there was a shuffle to do this), and finally we followed Bryn and family over to fight for parking in that very congested area of the city. Bryn pulled into a spot we thought we had lucked into(!) and it took another ten minutes or so before the parking gods smiled on us. </p>
<p>Brunch at the Bay Fung Tong restaurant was delicious. I was really hungry by the time we got there, so was very happy with the noodle and bok choy dish, the very light vegetarian fried rice, and the spring rolls. Doug also had candied walnut prawns along with Akane and Bryn. Riku, who is not fond of nuts at all, quite liked these sugary ones. There was a meat dumpling dish as well, and a platter of Chinese greens... all empty by the time we finished up. Mirei happily snacked on smashed green peas, bits of broccoli, grains of rice, and whatever else she could find to put in her mouth! </p>
<p>Riku, aka Ultraman, was sitting in his Hallowe'en costume, looking a little shy about the fuss I made over him. He really just looked so cute, I couldn't help but grin away at him. The costume is silver and blue with some red on it, and fits quite closely thanks to a long back zipper. He and Mirei both got lots of attention from the mostly Chinese customers. </p>
<p>Riku was such a tired boy, and wanted to come home with us, but I didn't want to be the one to try to keep him awake or waken him when he fell asleep. Instead he went on to Japantown with his family, had some soft ice cream, got to go to the store that sells Ultraman and the "monsters" he is so fond of, and then he and Mirei fell asleep the minute they got into the car after those errands. </p>
<p>I volunteered to take him to the park at 4:30 for some exercise, but he was still dozing when Bryn pulled up in front of the house. Instead he came in, had a little snack, watched while I cut open the pomegranate... this was a sour one!... but he laughed when we both pulled faces as we ate them, and puttered a bit around his "studio", the little corner table in the kitchen. We spent the rest of his hour plus outside in the garden. Riku wanted to do some sweeping, so I joined him, asked him to pull some weeds for me, showed him the roots on the different weeds he pulled up, and he continued on doing that on his own. Once the obvious weeds were pulled, Riku collected two of his dump trucks and played with leaves and rocks while I finished sweeping. It looks so much better out there now! </p>
<p>Just before we had to leave to take Riku home, Doug had printed his name for him on a long strip of paper. He told Doug what letters made his name, and once it was done, I suggested he use this for a bookmark at his house. I demonstrated with a book here and he obviously liked the idea. </p>
<p>We left at 6:15 for the little walk home, with Riku clutching his little Ultraman and bookmark in one hand. Riku almost always wants to hold hands as we walk along, even though I remind him that he can walk on his own except when we cross the street. It's very sweet to have him insist that we hold hands; it won't last forever. We ran down the hill near our house, and tried to beat Grandpa around some of the corners. Doug pretended to be a statue at one point and made Riku laugh as he came to life as we walked by. This fifteen-minute walk was fun for all of us. </p>
<p>Akane had dinner on the table when we walked in (we had been invited to dinner... pasta with pesto), but I was still full from lunch, and Doug felt he could eat lightly as well. Bryn was off with Brent, making arrangements to lease a Honda Fit(!) ... something he had discussed earlier in the day. I think Akane was as surprised as we were that he had decided to act on this tonight! </p>
<p>After a very light dinner, and tea and veggies to take upstairs with us, we sat and watched the second half of the Robert Duvall western, which was just so well done, and ended almost happily-ever-after. </p>
<p>Emails... bed at 11:15.</p>
