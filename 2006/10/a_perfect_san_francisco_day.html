								<h2>A Perfect San Francisco Day</h2>
								<p>What a joy to wake up next to Riku with his bright shiny eyes, eager to start off his day with me. His first suggestion was one of our favourite things to do... snuggle up and read lots of books together. Today he picked out a big stack of Caillou books and just one Lift-the-Flap Spot book. We stack our pillows against the wall, and Riku settles in for a long read. Lucky us! I have done this with Brynnie from when he was a little guy; he would come to the living room, crawl into my "nest" and we would read until his parents woke up. Caillie and I are still reading together in the mornings, although now I draw on her back as well, just as I used to with my sisters. Caillie loves to hear all those stories from my childhood, and of course now, even though she has most of them down pat, she still likes to hear them from the source. </p>
<p>It's a holiday for Riku here today, so a rare treat was in store for us... a whole day together during the week. Normally I would have been tempted to take him to the Bay Area Discovery Museum or the zoo, both of which he would have enjoyed, but my guess is that both places would have been overrun with other children looking for fun things to do. So, after a quiet few hours at home, we headed off to Ocean Beach. The day was warm and sunny at 10:30, and there are too few days we get to just hang out there anymore. What a perfect destination for us! I packed up a simple picnic lunch for, Riku napped(!) on the way there for just one hour, and once he awoke we found a spot to sit and eat, and dig. We also played "I spy", a game I taught him just two or three days ago. He likes it and plays it well too. I think it will become a favourite. </p>
<p>There were unusual "islands" of sand built up near the water (I found out from Susan there had been a sand building contest this past weekend) and it made for an interesting exploration of all the tiny streams and pools they created. Riku had such a wonderful time! A family sitting nearby had made two castles joined by a moat, and Riku spent all of his time digging up mud to add to the moat, or making tiny balls of sand to put on top of the castle tops. However, he just loved having his feet in the warm shallow water, and wandering about doing whatever appealed to him at the time. </p>
<p>We went back to our blanket for some extra food, and then kicked the beach ball around for about half an hour. Riku was running hard, and trying hard to keep me from kicking it first. He has a good kick there, and I got in more exercise than I had planned to! He laughed out loud every time he managed to get it away from me, which wasn't hard, as the light wind was blowing the very light ball every which way. </p>
<p>I didn't want him to fall asleep on the way home at 4 P.M., but it was easy to keep him talking about all the things we could be on Hallowe'en. We both got sillier and sillier... I said I would be a tea pot so he said he would be a cup and saucer; I would be a sandwich and he would be the tomato, I would be a head, and he a body.. and on we went. Really he is going to be "Ultraman", an action hero from Japan, and I am going to be a witch. He likes the idea of everyone he knows dressing up and it would be fun to do this year especially when he and Amelia would both appreciate the adults doing so too. Amelia is going to be a ladybug, her latest favourite thing. </p>
<p>My shoulder and arm were bothering me a lot when we walked in. Riku heard me moaning (it was time for some anti-inflamatory meds) as I carried the three heavy bags up from the car. He was as sweet as could be; told me to take off my sandals and he would rub my back and make it feel better. I readily agreed (he did this a few days ago too and it did feel better), and went into the living room and sat on the sofa. He disappeared for a minute, told me to wait for him, and came back carrying his doctor kit. First he "knocked" on my back for about two minutes, leaning over to ask me if it felt better. Then he proceeded to examine me... my blood pressure was fine... 20/34, and my temperature was fine too... 81, and my knees were both in good form as he checked them with his little hammer. He told me I had a little fever, gave me a needle in each arm, and told me to have a little nap.</p>
<p>I had promised him some ice cream so he had the tiniest dish of Doug's vanilla I had spotted in the fridge. He eats it so daintily and carefully that he takes a long time to eat those few spoonfulls.  </p>
<p>Soon after, though, Riku wanted to paint, and wanted me to work on it with him after he had already filled most of the page. This was fun; we made green paint by his mixing by accident yellow and blue, and he was very excited by this. We made plankton for a big blue whale, and then had a tornado come through... lots of dark blue paint, and destroy the flowers we had made. We sure talked about lots of different things during this process; I think I hear a new language skill every single week these days! </p>
<p>We had time upstairs to do a Curious George puzzle, after which Riku came into the bedroom, carefully carrying the Chinese checkers board. We set up our marbles, and I taught him how to jump over the other marbles, and was he delighted when I told him he was winning! I hear that refrain a lot lately... "I won!" Bryn walked in just as we were close to finishing it. </p>
<p>Bryn's car has "died" on him, and he had planned to walk Riku home. However, I don't need the car tomorrow, and he needs to get Riku to school and then himself to work, so off they went in our car just after 6 o'clock. </p>
<p>Talked to Doug on Skype, finished up today's laundry, and did a little housework in the kitchen area. It sure needs it after my absence of five plus weeks, and the past week since coming home has been too busy for anything more than the basics. Slowly but surely getting there... </p>
<p>Bed at 10:30.</p>
