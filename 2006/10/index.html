								<h2><a href="/2006/10/an_oath_and_three_sleepy_child.html">An Oath and Three Sleepy Children</a></h2>
								<p>Today was the day that Bryn became a U.S. citizen! We dropped Riku off at school at 8:45 and proceeded downtown to the Masonic Hall on Nob Hill, where the swearing-in of new citizens takes place every few months. Today there were 1,095 recipients, a smaller crowd than the one Susan took part in a few months ago. </p>
<p>Still, there were 82 countries represented today and there was a huge crowd of family and friends there to witness the event. The commentator named each of the countries, starting with A ... Afghanistan, Armenia, Australia, all the way through to Yemin and Yugoslovia. Each group was asked to stand as their country of origin was called, and by far the largest groups were once again China, India, and the Philippines. Bryn was one of very few Canadians but was seated amongst folks from Guatamala, the Philippines, Vietnam, and China. </p>
<p>It's very touching to witness, as there are so many people who have struggled to get to this day. There are tears of joy being shed, and lots of photos taken with proudly held certificates of citizenship.</p>
<p> Bryn does not have to relinquish his Canadian citizenship, and will be able to get U.S. passports for both the children. Akane will remain a Japanese citizen as Japan does not recognize dual citizenship. </p>
<p>Bryn and I had just enough time for a small celebratory snack at Tartine Bakery in the Mission, the same place Susan and I celebrated her new status. Bryn went back to work and found that the staff had ordered a cake for him, a lovely and unexpected gesture. </p>
<p>At 12:20 I picked up a sleepy and sniffling Amelia from nursery school; her cough has improved but her nose is still runny. Poor wee girl cried for her mommy when I walked in, but we weren't in the car long before she was negotiating how much playtime she could have before napping. The timer was set for seven minutes, but after pushing the Miffy walker around for two minutes she said she wanted to go to bed "right now". That's twice that has happened and she was soon tucked in with a small bear and a soft blue blanket. Today was a banner day as I left her before she was sound asleep, and she rolled over and drifted off on her own. No one was more surprised than I! </p>
<p>Akane had walked over with Mirei at 2 P.M., so that she could continue on her own to pick up Riku from nursery school at 3. When Amelia came rushing out of her room after an hour, very pleased with herself for going to sleep on her own, she was just delighted to find Mirei sitting on the kitchen floor, waiting to smile at her. Amelia is going to be such a good big sister, as she is very solicitous about what Mirei put in her mouth, and quick to hand her things she was reaching out for. They played together so nicely for the longest time. </p>
<p>Mirei seems very happy to just sit in one spot for the longest time, exploring whatever is placed around her. I had laid out some stuffed animals in a trail for her originally, leading from the living room to the kitchen. She isn't crawling up on her hands and knees yet, but instead slides her body along, and moving well using this method of hers. </p>
<p>Akane and Riku made it here in record time, arriving just an hour after pick-up. Mirei was ready to be nursed (she wasn't crazy about the tiny "bits" in her oatmeal, as it isn't the baby cereal she is used to), and Amelia and Riku went outside in the back yard to play in the big pile of dried needles from the Monterey pine. Not too long after that, Akane left to walk Mirei home in the stroller and I took the two older children to the 20th Street park, where they ran and climbed and Riku had great fun pretending he was frightened by a mom pretending she was a scary lion, ready to eat him! It's one of Riku's very favourite things to do, but not Amelia's. She would rather climb, and she does it so well! </p>
<p>Susan came by for Amelia and stayed for a while longer with us; they went off home (Susan leaving me with a nice big burrito!), and I dropped Riku at home. Bryn was there already, and invited me to stay for dinner with them. Akane was going off to the studio tonight and I had already planned to be there to help put Riku to bed while Bryn watched Mirei. All went according to plan; Riku and I had time to look at a Robert Bateman book, dinner was simple and delicious, I gave Riku a warm bath, and then read "Green Eggs and Ham" to him. We were in his room by 7:15 and he was sound asleep at 7:30. Perfect for a tired boy. </p>
<p>I sat with Bryn admiring Mirei in the living room. She is just the happiest girl and played with stacking toys... Bryn had them on her toes, and I put them on her head... she just enjoys it all. Her very favourite thing seemed to be knocking down the stacks that Bryn made for her though. Soon she was rubbing her eyes, Brent arrived, I said goodbye, and minutes after I walked in the door, Bryn had IM'd to say that Mirei was fast asleep... good team work! </p>
<p>I sat and had a hot cup of tea, ate the tortilla chips from my burrito!, and tried hard to finish my wonderful Canadian novel borrowed from Kelly. However, I was tired, wrote a few emails, and turned out my light at 10:30. It was a busy happy day.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/10/a_perfect_san_francisco_day.html">A Perfect San Francisco Day</a></h2>
								<p>What a joy to wake up next to Riku with his bright shiny eyes, eager to start off his day with me. His first suggestion was one of our favourite things to do... snuggle up and read lots of books together. Today he picked out a big stack of Caillou books and just one Lift-the-Flap Spot book. We stack our pillows against the wall, and Riku settles in for a long read. Lucky us! I have done this with Brynnie from when he was a little guy; he would come to the living room, crawl into my "nest" and we would read until his parents woke up. Caillie and I are still reading together in the mornings, although now I draw on her back as well, just as I used to with my sisters. Caillie loves to hear all those stories from my childhood, and of course now, even though she has most of them down pat, she still likes to hear them from the source. </p>
<p>It's a holiday for Riku here today, so a rare treat was in store for us... a whole day together during the week. Normally I would have been tempted to take him to the Bay Area Discovery Museum or the zoo, both of which he would have enjoyed, but my guess is that both places would have been overrun with other children looking for fun things to do. So, after a quiet few hours at home, we headed off to Ocean Beach. The day was warm and sunny at 10:30, and there are too few days we get to just hang out there anymore. What a perfect destination for us! I packed up a simple picnic lunch for, Riku napped(!) on the way there for just one hour, and once he awoke we found a spot to sit and eat, and dig. We also played "I spy", a game I taught him just two or three days ago. He likes it and plays it well too. I think it will become a favourite. </p>
<p>There were unusual "islands" of sand built up near the water (I found out from Susan there had been a sand building contest this past weekend) and it made for an interesting exploration of all the tiny streams and pools they created. Riku had such a wonderful time! A family sitting nearby had made two castles joined by a moat, and Riku spent all of his time digging up mud to add to the moat, or making tiny balls of sand to put on top of the castle tops. However, he just loved having his feet in the warm shallow water, and wandering about doing whatever appealed to him at the time. </p>
<p>We went back to our blanket for some extra food, and then kicked the beach ball around for about half an hour. Riku was running hard, and trying hard to keep me from kicking it first. He has a good kick there, and I got in more exercise than I had planned to! He laughed out loud every time he managed to get it away from me, which wasn't hard, as the light wind was blowing the very light ball every which way. </p>
<p>I didn't want him to fall asleep on the way home at 4 P.M., but it was easy to keep him talking about all the things we could be on Hallowe'en. We both got sillier and sillier... I said I would be a tea pot so he said he would be a cup and saucer; I would be a sandwich and he would be the tomato, I would be a head, and he a body.. and on we went. Really he is going to be "Ultraman", an action hero from Japan, and I am going to be a witch. He likes the idea of everyone he knows dressing up and it would be fun to do this year especially when he and Amelia would both appreciate the adults doing so too. Amelia is going to be a ladybug, her latest favourite thing. </p>
<p>My shoulder and arm were bothering me a lot when we walked in. Riku heard me moaning (it was time for some anti-inflamatory meds) as I carried the three heavy bags up from the car. He was as sweet as could be; told me to take off my sandals and he would rub my back and make it feel better. I readily agreed (he did this a few days ago too and it did feel better), and went into the living room and sat on the sofa. He disappeared for a minute, told me to wait for him, and came back carrying his doctor kit. First he "knocked" on my back for about two minutes, leaning over to ask me if it felt better. Then he proceeded to examine me... my blood pressure was fine... 20/34, and my temperature was fine too... 81, and my knees were both in good form as he checked them with his little hammer. He told me I had a little fever, gave me a needle in each arm, and told me to have a little nap.</p>
<p>I had promised him some ice cream so he had the tiniest dish of Doug's vanilla I had spotted in the fridge. He eats it so daintily and carefully that he takes a long time to eat those few spoonfulls.  </p>
<p>Soon after, though, Riku wanted to paint, and wanted me to work on it with him after he had already filled most of the page. This was fun; we made green paint by his mixing by accident yellow and blue, and he was very excited by this. We made plankton for a big blue whale, and then had a tornado come through... lots of dark blue paint, and destroy the flowers we had made. We sure talked about lots of different things during this process; I think I hear a new language skill every single week these days! </p>
<p>We had time upstairs to do a Curious George puzzle, after which Riku came into the bedroom, carefully carrying the Chinese checkers board. We set up our marbles, and I taught him how to jump over the other marbles, and was he delighted when I told him he was winning! I hear that refrain a lot lately... "I won!" Bryn walked in just as we were close to finishing it. </p>
<p>Bryn's car has "died" on him, and he had planned to walk Riku home. However, I don't need the car tomorrow, and he needs to get Riku to school and then himself to work, so off they went in our car just after 6 o'clock. </p>
<p>Talked to Doug on Skype, finished up today's laundry, and did a little housework in the kitchen area. It sure needs it after my absence of five plus weeks, and the past week since coming home has been too busy for anything more than the basics. Slowly but surely getting there... </p>
<p>Bed at 10:30.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/10/a_rare_twomovie_day.html">A Rare Two-Movie Day!</a></h2>
								<p>As Riku says: It's the weekend! A long time ago Doug and I often used to see a double feature on both days of the weekend, but then he was out of work for over two years, we cut back on outings like this, which often involved dinner out as well, and then discovered Netflix, which allowed us to see all these same great movies at home. But it is still a treat to get out of the house and sit in a dark theater, where I am not reminded that the bedroom really needs a good vacuuming, or the bathroom needs cleaning the next day. </p>
<p>Doug went off to his T'ai Chi class at 9:40, picking up Bryn and Riku on his way, so they could borrow the car for a quick trip to Japantown. I vacuumed the bedroom, despite my usual no-housework-on-the-weekend rule, and then did a lot of catching up on my emails. I also packed us each a sandwich to eat at the movie, as well as some fruit for dessert. I have some weight to lose, and as much as I hate to give up my two-bucket popcorn habit (I do share with Doug, but I eat most of it!), I just must be more disciplined about what I am eating and in the case of the popcorn... how much!  </p>
<p>Our movies were at the Four Star Theatre out in the Richmond District and we saw two movies for just $7.00 the pair... a huge bargain. What a treat this was... "Little Miss Sunshine" had been highly recommended by both Susan and Liz, and we agreed completely with them, and then so enjoyed Maggie Smith and Rowan Atkinson in "Keeping Mum", a dark comedy. The acting was just terrific in both of them. </p>
<p>We bought four big new crop pomegranates at the independent grocer next to the theatre, and then treated ourselves to a rare dinner out. There is a great little pizzeria near the Four Star with just four indoor tables and two outside, and it was the perfect place for an early dinner. We shared a starter of lightly sauteed thin green beans, with slices of a mild French feta, small heirloom tomatoes, and a slice of crusty grilled bread topped with tapenade. Next came the pizza they are well known for... thin crispy crusts and topped with a fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, and basil. It was all delicious, and tastier because it has been ages since we ate there. </p>
<p>Once home, Doug and I checked our emails and then went through Amelia's birthday parties photos, managing to get them down to just 100! There were lots of fun photos of all the children at the party, as well as their parents, so I shall get those annotated as soon as possible. </p>
<p>We're still trying to get through a huge stack of tapes and movies from my six weeks away in August and September, so watched the first two hours of a Robert Duvall western. It is set in 1898, just two years before Gram was born, and it's hard to imagine that just four generations ago, young Chinese girls were being sent from China to be sold to the highest bidder in the mining towns in the U.S.A. The two hours flew by, and we shall watch the rest of it tomorrow night. </p>
<p><br />
Bryn had left a message on our answering machine inviting us to join them, Brent, and a young woman from work plus her husband, for vegetable tempura. However, we had just eaten and even though I was tempted to go over to see the children (this was my first day since arriving home three weeks ago that I didn't see them!), I resisted and just relaxed with Doug at home. We also had an invitation to join them for dim sum tomorrow morning, a place they all went to when I was in Ontario, or as Bryn put it, "when I deserted the family". </p>
<p>I spoke briefly with Riku who had just put on his Ultraman Hallowe'en costume for the guests; Bryn said he was a little shy in it, but if he wears it a few times by Hallowe'en he will be feeling his "power" in it. They were busy icing gingerbread people so we ended our conversation with our "I love you" and "night night."</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/10/a_most_relaxing_sunday.html">A Most Relaxing Sunday</a></h2>
								<p>Today was a very relaxing and quiet day around here. It felt like a Sunday from beginning to end, and I took advantage of it and didn't do one productive thing! Bryn had asked us last night if we would like to go for Dim Sum for brunch today, so we had a lazy early morning, both eating lightly, reading the paper, and answering emails. </p>
<p>I had offered to have Mirei here for her morning nap so Bryn popped over with her. When he brought her to the door, she gave me that huge smile and then all four limbs went into overdrive in excitement; she sure knows how to make me feel special! </p>
<p>Mirei is noticing everything now; she looks up to see the bird's head in the stairwell that Doug started pointing out to her last week, she always looks up at the bird mobile in the room when you ask her where it is, and now when asked "Where are the brooms?" she will almost always turn to look at them hanging on the wall beside the table. Being able to make the plastic bus make music is a new treat too; she pushes the buttons and out comes sound! I will have to keep up with this blog or so many fun new experiences of hers will be forgotten.<br />
 <br />
Before her nap, Mirei did have a big bowl of oatmeal and some fruit,  finishing off with water sipped through a straw. She was doing this when I first arrived home three weeks ago, and it still makes me smile to see her do it so well. </p>
<p>Sandy, Doug's sister, had written to me once, after reading a blog about Mirei using a sippy cup for breast milk, telling me that breast- fed babies have a very easy time using a straw. I told Akane right away and apparently she tried it at home and it worked just as Sandy had said it would. I left for Ontario too soon to see her in action, but I must say, to see that little girl lean forward and sip away as though she's always beeen doing it is just adorable! </p>
<p>Then it was nap time; she's just such an easy child to put down for her sleep, the room is dark and quiet, and I get to see that little face when she wakens too!</p>
<p>Bryn stayed on while Mirei slept, peeking in at her in wonder. He just cannot get over how beautiful she is, and with just a soft blanket tucked around her from the waist down, and those chubby arms and chest visible, I completely agree with him! Of course she is a beautiful little girl always, but those arms, and the "bracelets" around them are priceless. She napped for an hour and forty-five minutes. Bryn and I had more time than usual to discuss the school situation for Riku next year, their car dilemma (to buy? lease? new? old?), what the children are doing, and Riku's newfound friendship with the five-year-old girl who lives downstairs from him. He was playing at her apartment early yesterday afternoon, and then she came and played at Riku's while her little sister was napping. </p>
<p>Bryn said he was the sweetest host, showing her his room first... the dialogue was apparently something like: "This is my room, I have lots of toys, come and see my sister, she is very cute, sometimes she touches my toys, there is a spider in this book, do you want to see it... " and on it went. </p>
<p>So, once Mirei was awake and finished with her photo session on the bed, we got two cars organized for the trip to the Richmond District... Brent loaned his car to Bryn (there was a shuffle to do this), and finally we followed Bryn and family over to fight for parking in that very congested area of the city. Bryn pulled into a spot we thought we had lucked into(!) and it took another ten minutes or so before the parking gods smiled on us. </p>
<p>Brunch at the Bay Fung Tong restaurant was delicious. I was really hungry by the time we got there, so was very happy with the noodle and bok choy dish, the very light vegetarian fried rice, and the spring rolls. Doug also had candied walnut prawns along with Akane and Bryn. Riku, who is not fond of nuts at all, quite liked these sugary ones. There was a meat dumpling dish as well, and a platter of Chinese greens... all empty by the time we finished up. Mirei happily snacked on smashed green peas, bits of broccoli, grains of rice, and whatever else she could find to put in her mouth! </p>
<p>Riku, aka Ultraman, was sitting in his Hallowe'en costume, looking a little shy about the fuss I made over him. He really just looked so cute, I couldn't help but grin away at him. The costume is silver and blue with some red on it, and fits quite closely thanks to a long back zipper. He and Mirei both got lots of attention from the mostly Chinese customers. </p>
<p>Riku was such a tired boy, and wanted to come home with us, but I didn't want to be the one to try to keep him awake or waken him when he fell asleep. Instead he went on to Japantown with his family, had some soft ice cream, got to go to the store that sells Ultraman and the "monsters" he is so fond of, and then he and Mirei fell asleep the minute they got into the car after those errands. </p>
<p>I volunteered to take him to the park at 4:30 for some exercise, but he was still dozing when Bryn pulled up in front of the house. Instead he came in, had a little snack, watched while I cut open the pomegranate... this was a sour one!... but he laughed when we both pulled faces as we ate them, and puttered a bit around his "studio", the little corner table in the kitchen. We spent the rest of his hour plus outside in the garden. Riku wanted to do some sweeping, so I joined him, asked him to pull some weeds for me, showed him the roots on the different weeds he pulled up, and he continued on doing that on his own. Once the obvious weeds were pulled, Riku collected two of his dump trucks and played with leaves and rocks while I finished sweeping. It looks so much better out there now! </p>
<p>Just before we had to leave to take Riku home, Doug had printed his name for him on a long strip of paper. He told Doug what letters made his name, and once it was done, I suggested he use this for a bookmark at his house. I demonstrated with a book here and he obviously liked the idea. </p>
<p>We left at 6:15 for the little walk home, with Riku clutching his little Ultraman and bookmark in one hand. Riku almost always wants to hold hands as we walk along, even though I remind him that he can walk on his own except when we cross the street. It's very sweet to have him insist that we hold hands; it won't last forever. We ran down the hill near our house, and tried to beat Grandpa around some of the corners. Doug pretended to be a statue at one point and made Riku laugh as he came to life as we walked by. This fifteen-minute walk was fun for all of us. </p>
<p>Akane had dinner on the table when we walked in (we had been invited to dinner... pasta with pesto), but I was still full from lunch, and Doug felt he could eat lightly as well. Bryn was off with Brent, making arrangements to lease a Honda Fit(!) ... something he had discussed earlier in the day. I think Akane was as surprised as we were that he had decided to act on this tonight! </p>
<p>After a very light dinner, and tea and veggies to take upstairs with us, we sat and watched the second half of the Robert Duvall western, which was just so well done, and ended almost happily-ever-after. </p>
<p>Emails... bed at 11:15.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/10/a_new_week.html">A New Week</a></h2>
								<p>Monday already; the weekend flew by! It was a typical Monday here... tidying up from the weekend, a little vacuuming on this floor, the washing, a leisurely breakfast after some emailing... was getting caught up on the weekend but somehow I'm up to 50 unanswered again. Susan may be right; perhaps it's impossible to really ever catch up. </p>
<p>Akane arrived in a sweat at 1:50 after carrying Mirei all the way here from home! The stroller was left in the car last night.. and this is not a lightweight baby. Mirei didn't nap well at home again today, and she was up with her dad in the night, so I tucked her in immediately and she was fast asleep, looking like a dream baby, in just a few minutes. It's fun to watch her settle herself; she plays with her fingers, much as Riku did, stares at the colourful children's toy print on the wall, done by a friend of Susan's and Bryn's years ago (Kelly has one too), but mostly mesmerized by the bird mobile I start swinging just as I lay her down. I think it might be slightly hypnotic, as her eyes keep watching it, but the lids close slightly, and then more so, and then she's off to nod land. She also rubs her eyes, and rubs the top of her head with both hands, and when first settling will often blow on the side of her hand, making loud noises. It's all part and parcel of her little sleep routine, and I don't do anything more than gently rub her tummy in circles, slowing down as she drifts off. </p>
<p>Doug took some photos of the two of us in the backyard today. I have a lovely one of me with Caillie near this same age, that I hope to replicate. Shall see how they turn out! </p>
<p>Mirei is paying more and more attention to all the things around her. Today she noticed the clock striking two and we rushed in to see it as she turned around to see where the noise was coming from. She puts her hand or one index finger up in the air, for Doug to do the same to her. She waves goodbye to her mommy at the door and window, and to Doug as he says "good night" to her. And it's a big enthusiastic wave too, which is lots of fun for us all.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/10/saturday_catching_up_and_49_up.html">"49 Up".. and Catching Up.. a Night Alone at Home</a></h2>
								<p>I slept in again this morning until almost 8 A.M., a lovely way to start off the weekend. Usual morning routine... checked emails, wrote to my sisters, showered, had breakfast while reading the paper, and waved goodbye to Doug as he left for T'ai Chi. Hard to decide whether to iron or to sit and catch up on emails, but the latter won out. It's something I can only do when the children aren't here, whereas Mirei is very happy  to crawl around the bedroom, exploring the Lego and book and stuffed animal baskets, while I iron. </p>
<p>Doug and I left the house at 11:30 for two Freecycle pick-ups... a soaker hose and a bag full of sketching pencils for Riku, both of which will be very useful. We were in the Richmond District, which is chock full of Chinese restaurants, and chose a new vegetarian spot, called "Bok Choy Garden". The food was delicious... we had potstickers, mu shu vegetables and a sweet "beef" dish with snow peas and carrots. The host was very friendly; they just opened under new owners two weeks ago, and he assured us they will eventually do our old favourite dish from years ago, Beijing duck, as well as Doug's favourite twice-cooked tofu and lemon "duck". It these are done well, we'll be back there many times. </p>
<p>Drove to the Opera Plaza cinema to see the latest in the long running series of "7 Up" films. It's a British documentary done with a group of children from various backgrounds, who are interviewed every seven years from the age of seven. We are now up to "49 Up" and what a delight it always is to see how they are all doing. What was surprising to us this time is how many of them resent this intrusion into their lives, but luckily for us, continue to agree to be interviewed. One fellow, Neil, an upper-class child, has held our interest particularly as he has been through some very rough times; this film shows him thriving after years and years of heartbreak. He is my favourite person, although somehow we feel attached to them all. </p>
<p>We stopped for a big supply of fresh veggies and staples at Rainbow on our way home, and Doug left almost instantly for an evening out with a fellow PEA member, who is in town for six weeks with his amazing (and world renowned) act called "Mind Games". They had dinner together, and I spent the evening culling through old emails, making great headway. </p>
<p>I even turned down a tempting invitation over to Hampshire Street, to spend some time with Bryn and Mirei after Riku was tucked in. Riku had a friend, Alex, over tonight while his parents went out for dinner , so Riku would have been a tired boy at the end of his busy day. Hard as it was I Instead did what I intended to do, after turning down dinner plans with Doug and Marc as well, and am well on my way to catching up on emails. Too many friends have been too long neglected. </p>
<p>The clocks get turned back tonight, Doug had a headache, and so off we went off to bed earlier than usual, with lots of time to read. Lights out at 11 P.M. although the clock said 10 o'clock.</p>
<p>or the 28th... the following... </p>

good<br />
bryn says:<br />
she just went down for her "afternoon" nap<br />
bryn says:<br />
but should work out ok<br />
Lynne says:<br />
wow... late!<br />
Lynne says:<br />
really, she just had the one nap today?<br />
bryn says:<br />
yeah, it was late-ish<br />
bryn says:<br />
we tried earlier with no luck<br />
bryn says:<br />
i guess the longer night sleep gave her more energy<br />
bryn says:<br />
i think it was noon - 2pm?<br />
Lynne says:<br />
usually it's the other way around... the babies who nap well during the day also nap well at night<br />
Lynne says:<br />
Amelia is a good example of the other<br />
Lynne says:<br />
doesn't sleep well at night or during the day... without a lot of trouble<br />
bryn says:<br />
i definitely tried earlier but she wasn't ready<br />
Lynne says:<br />
ah well, keep trying<br />
bryn says:<br />
she's had a good day, mood-wise<br />
Lynne says:<br />
nice to have her sleeping during Riku's last hour or so up<br />
bryn says:<br />
y<br />
Lynne says:<br />
49 Up was amazing!<br />
bryn says:<br />
if she wakes at 7:30 or 8, that's ok maybe<br />
Lynne says:<br />
we both love that series so much<br />
bryn says:<br />
spend the next two hours feeding her then tuck-in<br />
Lynne says:<br />
yes, just keep her moving!<br />
bryn says:<br />
would love to see it<br />
bryn says:<br />
riku got out three times today... he'll sleep well<br />
Lynne says:<br />
great!<br />
bryn says:<br />
he's coughing but very little<br />
bryn says:<br />
a walk, a long trike trip, and the park w. alex<br />
Lynne says:<br />
whew... we seemed to have stopped it in its tracks<br />
bryn says:<br />
alex is a great role model for him, fitness-wise<br />
bryn says:<br />
"why is alex always winning?"<br />
Lynne says:<br />
riku is really picking up on it tho<br />
bryn says:<br />
"don't worry riku, we're not racing"<br />
Lynne says:<br />
wants to be bush now at the park and not sitting watching<br />
Lynne says:<br />
nice of Alex!<br />
bryn says:<br />
alex went down our hall stairs head-first...<br />
Lynne says:<br />
no!<br />
bryn says:<br />
no, that was my answer!<br />
bryn says:<br />
on purpose, "like a penguin!"<br />
Lynne says:<br />
ohhhhhh<br />
bryn says:<br />
riku, of course, followed suit<br />
Lynne says:<br />
whew!<br />
bryn says:<br />
and did just fine<br />
bryn says:<br />
they did great at the park...<br />
bryn says:<br />
now it's dinner... shall run<br />
Lynne says:<br />
ok<br />
Lynne says:<br />
bye for now xo</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/10/little_miss_pointer_actually.html">Little Miss Pointer, Actually</a></h2>
								<p>Doug turned all the clocks back last night when we went to bed at 11 P.M., but I think since the clock read 10 o'clock my body felt it was too early to be sleeping! I had trouble staying asleep, woke up at 5:30 (formerly 6:30) and stayed up. I will have no problems sleeping tonight at all! Yawn! </p>
<p>Doug, Bryn, Riku (aka Ultraman!.. yes, he was wearing his costume again this Sunday), and I headed off to Costco at 10 o'clock for a quick run-through; it was too early for samples, one of the things I like best about Costco(!), but it was just as well. We got through the line quickly, and dropped Bryn and Riku off at Ashbury Street, for a little play time for the children, and for Bryn to borrow Susan's & Kevin's car. I had offered to babysit for all four of them to see "49 Up", but Amelia needs her afternoon nap for sure, and it wouldn't necessarily have happened here with me. We'll try for Wednesday night, as I know they would both like to see the film as well. </p>
<p>Riku and Mirei were here at 2:35; Mirei was supposed to be ready for her nap but apparently she wasn't told about it, as she fussed just long enough that I knew it wasn't going to happen. So, up she got and  played with Riku on the floor for quite a while; I wouldn't be at all surprised if she soon is crawling on her hands and knees, and gives up her "GI Joe" crawl. I could see her trying over and over to get herself up today, and standing for a long time at the mirrored glass in the oven. </p>
<p>Despite her daddy having told me that she had eaten a large meal two hours ago, and nursed just fifteen minutes before they brought her over, this was a hungry girl less than an hour later! She must be going through a growth spurt, as she is obviously happy to eat every two hours or so! She ate a portion of veggies, and then another of cereal mixed with the veggies, sipped down a portion of breast milk, and an hour and a half later I left a sleeping baby in the room, all bundled up. She was funny today, though, as for the first time she made little growling sounds as she was trying to settle herself... quite forceful ones too! Such funny sounds to be coming out of this very sweet little female child! </p>
<p>I had asked Riku if he would be very quiet while I tucked Mirei in, and not to come into the room while I was with her. What a guy! I came out about seven minutes later (I ended up bundling her, as I think she was overtired and not giving in to it) to find him in the front bedroom, with a nice stack of books on the bed, leafing through what was obviously more than the first one. I was so proud of him, and told him so. </p>
<p>He asked if I could feed him some pasta while we watched TV together, and since this is such a rare treat for us, up we went to see some Pixar shorts (he watched "Tin Toy" twice), and then about half a tape of snow-blowing. He ate all the pasta and a "meatball", and finished off a half slice of "Grandpa's special toast" as well. We sat on the floor together while he built a long train and chatted away to himself about what was happening... it was backing up, going over big snow-covered hills, getting stuck, getting unstuck... quite an adventure! We came downstairs and he had a little time to play with his shells before his parents arrived home. </p>
<p>Mirei had been up for just ten minutes or so; she napped for a full two hours, and spent that ten minutes doing exactly what Bryn told me she had been doing all morning.... using her index finger constantly, to point out things she wanted to see, or to merely touch fingers with me, just wanting to connect I suppose. It is darling. She looked adorable in a pair of pink gingham overalls and a sweet cream-coloured top that my friend Judi Speirs gave to her. </p>
<p>As soon as Mirei had nursed (underfed child that she is!), off they all went home. It was close to 6 P.M. and tomorrow is a school day for Riku, with a bath, dinner, and some story time before bed at 7:30. </p>
<p>I had a couple of hours to myself before Doug arrived back from his day out with Marc; they met for lunch, did lots of sightseeing in the city, and ended up in Berkeley for pizza at Zachary's. There were even two slices brought home for me which I shall enjoy for my lunch tomorrow! I sat in the living room eating leftover pasta and drinking a hot cup of tea once I was on my own. </p>
<p>Today was a marathon emailing day, although I am still in the middle of answering numbers of emails from two good friends, but down to a mere twenty once those are done! I am really seeing the light at the end of the tunnel here. Whew! I really believe it has been two years since I have been down to zero waiting to be answered. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched an "Inspector Linley" episode, a British detective show, one we always enjoy. I got a nice long backrub and came very close to dozing off during it... but I'm off to bed now at 11:20.  </p>
<p>P.S. I noticed Riku saying "actually" several times today. It's very cute, as it is a Dyment word for certain. I so well remember hearing Caillie saying it when she was a little girl. In fact, I believe I remember the first sentence I heard her use it in. She had "painted" her fingernails and part of her arms with coloured icing, being used on Valentine's Day cookies. A little girl, whom Kelly babysat, told her that it was icing for the cookies, in quite an imperious little five year old voice. Caillie answered back immediately with "Actually Emma, it is nail polish." looking and sounding ever so serious! We howled with laughter; I have a photo of the results too. </p>
<p>Funny how things come to you at the end of the day, so I am adding this to my blog the next day. Riku had a tiny dish of vanilla chocolate fudge ice cream yesterday afternoon. I teased him a little, saying I wasn't sure he was going to like it. Of course he did and polished it off saying "that was <strong>very</strong> good!" and then announced, out of the blue about two hours later "That ice cream was <strong>amazing</strong>!" </p>
<p>And when Bryn and Akane dropped in to pick up the children, Bryn asked Riku to tell me about his bad dream from the night before. It was a sad one... he dreamed that I was lost at an airport and he couldn't find me. Bryn said it took him about four minutes to get him to awaken and settle him down from it, as he was crying in his sleep. Poor wee guy.</p>
