								<h2>A New Week</h2>
								<p>Monday already; the weekend flew by! It was a typical Monday here... tidying up from the weekend, a little vacuuming on this floor, the washing, a leisurely breakfast after some emailing... was getting caught up on the weekend but somehow I'm up to 50 unanswered again. Susan may be right; perhaps it's impossible to really ever catch up. </p>
<p>Akane arrived in a sweat at 1:50 after carrying Mirei all the way here from home! The stroller was left in the car last night.. and this is not a lightweight baby. Mirei didn't nap well at home again today, and she was up with her dad in the night, so I tucked her in immediately and she was fast asleep, looking like a dream baby, in just a few minutes. It's fun to watch her settle herself; she plays with her fingers, much as Riku did, stares at the colourful children's toy print on the wall, done by a friend of Susan's and Bryn's years ago (Kelly has one too), but mostly mesmerized by the bird mobile I start swinging just as I lay her down. I think it might be slightly hypnotic, as her eyes keep watching it, but the lids close slightly, and then more so, and then she's off to nod land. She also rubs her eyes, and rubs the top of her head with both hands, and when first settling will often blow on the side of her hand, making loud noises. It's all part and parcel of her little sleep routine, and I don't do anything more than gently rub her tummy in circles, slowing down as she drifts off. </p>
<p>Doug took some photos of the two of us in the backyard today. I have a lovely one of me with Caillie near this same age, that I hope to replicate. Shall see how they turn out! </p>
<p>Mirei is paying more and more attention to all the things around her. Today she noticed the clock striking two and we rushed in to see it as she turned around to see where the noise was coming from. She puts her hand or one index finger up in the air, for Doug to do the same to her. She waves goodbye to her mommy at the door and window, and to Doug as he says "good night" to her. And it's a big enthusiastic wave too, which is lots of fun for us all.</p>
