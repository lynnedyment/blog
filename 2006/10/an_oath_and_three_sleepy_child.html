								<h2>An Oath and Three Sleepy Children</h2>
								<p>Today was the day that Bryn became a U.S. citizen! We dropped Riku off at school at 8:45 and proceeded downtown to the Masonic Hall on Nob Hill, where the swearing-in of new citizens takes place every few months. Today there were 1,095 recipients, a smaller crowd than the one Susan took part in a few months ago. </p>
<p>Still, there were 82 countries represented today and there was a huge crowd of family and friends there to witness the event. The commentator named each of the countries, starting with A ... Afghanistan, Armenia, Australia, all the way through to Yemin and Yugoslovia. Each group was asked to stand as their country of origin was called, and by far the largest groups were once again China, India, and the Philippines. Bryn was one of very few Canadians but was seated amongst folks from Guatamala, the Philippines, Vietnam, and China. </p>
<p>It's very touching to witness, as there are so many people who have struggled to get to this day. There are tears of joy being shed, and lots of photos taken with proudly held certificates of citizenship.</p>
<p> Bryn does not have to relinquish his Canadian citizenship, and will be able to get U.S. passports for both the children. Akane will remain a Japanese citizen as Japan does not recognize dual citizenship. </p>
<p>Bryn and I had just enough time for a small celebratory snack at Tartine Bakery in the Mission, the same place Susan and I celebrated her new status. Bryn went back to work and found that the staff had ordered a cake for him, a lovely and unexpected gesture. </p>
<p>At 12:20 I picked up a sleepy and sniffling Amelia from nursery school; her cough has improved but her nose is still runny. Poor wee girl cried for her mommy when I walked in, but we weren't in the car long before she was negotiating how much playtime she could have before napping. The timer was set for seven minutes, but after pushing the Miffy walker around for two minutes she said she wanted to go to bed "right now". That's twice that has happened and she was soon tucked in with a small bear and a soft blue blanket. Today was a banner day as I left her before she was sound asleep, and she rolled over and drifted off on her own. No one was more surprised than I! </p>
<p>Akane had walked over with Mirei at 2 P.M., so that she could continue on her own to pick up Riku from nursery school at 3. When Amelia came rushing out of her room after an hour, very pleased with herself for going to sleep on her own, she was just delighted to find Mirei sitting on the kitchen floor, waiting to smile at her. Amelia is going to be such a good big sister, as she is very solicitous about what Mirei put in her mouth, and quick to hand her things she was reaching out for. They played together so nicely for the longest time. </p>
<p>Mirei seems very happy to just sit in one spot for the longest time, exploring whatever is placed around her. I had laid out some stuffed animals in a trail for her originally, leading from the living room to the kitchen. She isn't crawling up on her hands and knees yet, but instead slides her body along, and moving well using this method of hers. </p>
<p>Akane and Riku made it here in record time, arriving just an hour after pick-up. Mirei was ready to be nursed (she wasn't crazy about the tiny "bits" in her oatmeal, as it isn't the baby cereal she is used to), and Amelia and Riku went outside in the back yard to play in the big pile of dried needles from the Monterey pine. Not too long after that, Akane left to walk Mirei home in the stroller and I took the two older children to the 20th Street park, where they ran and climbed and Riku had great fun pretending he was frightened by a mom pretending she was a scary lion, ready to eat him! It's one of Riku's very favourite things to do, but not Amelia's. She would rather climb, and she does it so well! </p>
<p>Susan came by for Amelia and stayed for a while longer with us; they went off home (Susan leaving me with a nice big burrito!), and I dropped Riku at home. Bryn was there already, and invited me to stay for dinner with them. Akane was going off to the studio tonight and I had already planned to be there to help put Riku to bed while Bryn watched Mirei. All went according to plan; Riku and I had time to look at a Robert Bateman book, dinner was simple and delicious, I gave Riku a warm bath, and then read "Green Eggs and Ham" to him. We were in his room by 7:15 and he was sound asleep at 7:30. Perfect for a tired boy. </p>
<p>I sat with Bryn admiring Mirei in the living room. She is just the happiest girl and played with stacking toys... Bryn had them on her toes, and I put them on her head... she just enjoys it all. Her very favourite thing seemed to be knocking down the stacks that Bryn made for her though. Soon she was rubbing her eyes, Brent arrived, I said goodbye, and minutes after I walked in the door, Bryn had IM'd to say that Mirei was fast asleep... good team work! </p>
<p>I sat and had a hot cup of tea, ate the tortilla chips from my burrito!, and tried hard to finish my wonderful Canadian novel borrowed from Kelly. However, I was tired, wrote a few emails, and turned out my light at 10:30. It was a busy happy day.</p>
