								<h2>To Market, to Market...</h2>
								<p>This morning, before getting out of bed, I spent a few minutes thinking about Auntie Rita and her special place in my life. One year ago today we lost her and it's still often hard to believe. I had a rare morning cup of tea, toast with almost-the-end of Auntie Rita's perfect blackberry jam, and thought more good thoughts about my special times with her. </p>
<p>Bryn had a breakfast meeting this morning. It was a gorgeous sunny day, and the farmers' market was calling; Akane and Riku were happy to accompany us, but first I walked over to get Riku while his mom napped and showered. </p>
<p>We enjoyed our long leisurely stroll back here, inspecting all the various bits and pieces on the sidewalk and around the trees, finding a heart-shaped rock, and today's best find of all: a very unusual seed pod. Riku was a little worried about it at first, but was soon showing it off to Doug, along with a tiny red seed that fell out of it. </p>
<p>Oh, he stopped to wave to Lily, our local dry cleaning lady, and blew her a kiss too. This has become a ritual on our walk between Hampshire and Rhode Island Streets. </p>
<p>Riku had a big bowl of oatmeal and strawberries, played with his cars and trucks for a bit, and then settled in for a forty-five-minute nap. He decided at one point, just before closing his eyes, that he wanted to have a BM... and so up he got and sat on the toilet for a couple of minutes. I think it was just a delaying tactic and it worked. However, I don't want to discourage this behaviour at all; it's just starting to be of interest to him. </p>
<p>We picked Akane up and headed for the Alemany Market around noon; a few of the stalls had closed, but it's certainly a quieter and less crowded experience later in the day. There were lots of bargains too, as closing time drew nearer. I bought plenty of persimmons, ten small but very red and ripe organic pomegranates (wee Bryn and I share a passion for these), and some tiny newly picked red potatoes; Doug added cheese curds and Medjool dates. </p>
<p>Riku was tired and ready for some lunch and another nap when we dropped them off at 1:30; Doug and I headed off to a double feature at the Balboa...  a wonderfully acted British film called "Stage Beauty", about men playing the parts of women during Shakespearean times... and "p.s." which was a bit far-fetched but again wonderfully acted by Laura Linney. </p>
<p>We stopped for burritos on Mission Street on the way home, a favourite place where the burritos don't contain rice, and so are a little lighter. Perfect. </p>
<p>Home to emails and photo work on the computer... and back to my blog after a certain sister, who shall remain anonymous, wrote an email making me feel very guilty about my neglect the past few weeks...</p>
