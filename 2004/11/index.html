								<h2><a href="/2004/11/thursday_with_riku.html">Thursday with Riku</a></h2>
								<p>Thursday is my regularly scheduled day with Riku, and we had tentative plans to take him to either San Jose (to the Discovery Museum) or to a small museum here in the city. I didn't walk over to pick him up until 9:30 and he was a sleepy boy, so we decided the smaller and local Randall Museum would be the perfect fit for today. </p>
<p>He enjoyed his walk over here as always, stopping to wave hello to Lily (she is our local one-woman dry cleaning lady) and blowing her a kiss for the first time; she was thrilled to bits. Riku is such a friendly little boy and waves hello or says "Hi!" to almost everyone he passes. </p>
<p>We sat and had breakfast together; Riku really enjoys scooping up the biggest blueberries and cherries from his hot cereal. Today he ate a whole piece of toast too, and went down for his morning nap with a bulging tummy. </p>
<p>Of course he needed some time with his full tin of cars, trucks, buses, motorcycle, skateboard, and bicycle when he awoke and then he was ready for some lunch. I can't believe how much he is eating these days! Today he had polenta, fresh tomatoes, and lots of mushrooms, sauteed in butter (his very favourite and they disappear first). </p>
<p>Off we went to the Randall Museum, just above the Castro District. There is a large room filled with caged animals which are either disabled or too old to survive on their own in the wild. We saw crows, ravens, magpies, a tiny short-eared owl, a bald eagle, several kinds of hawks, quail, toads, frogs, snakes, salamanders, turtles, tortoise, rats, chickens, rabbits, mice, guinea pigs, sea stars, tarantula, scorpion, and bees in combs... plus many more I'm sure I have forgotten! </p>
<p>Riku enjoyed being in the cage with the rabbits and chickens, but wasn't terribly interested in the birds once he had paid them attention initially. However, he was very interested in climbing up and down each set of small stoops to look at the frogs, toads, and spiders. This kept him busy for a long time, until he discovered four drawers filled with various interesting objects, and a magnifying glass to inspect them even more carefully. </p>
<p>There was a long ramp leading down to the basement and Riku quite enjoys moving quickly up and down any ramps he comes across these days. However, this was a bonus ramp with a vast model railroad set-up in the basement. Normally this is only open for a few hours on Saturday, but today one of the "engineers" was in working on the trains and invited us in to watch. What a treat! He was so nice and ran the trains in such a way that they came by us more frequently. Doug was very keen and asked lots of questions and as a result of this we were invited "behind the scenes" to follow the trains right 'round the back to where the public is not normally allowed. Riku was most fond of the "smoke", the tunnels, and the bridges. What a fun half hour that was! </p>
<p>Just as we pulled up at home, Akane and Bryn pulled in behind us. Bryn said they would come up for a bit, and I invited them to stay for an impromptu dinner... penne pasta with tomato sauce and some homemade pesto, and a big mixed green salad with avocado and pine nuts. Once again Riku ate a good sized portion of dinner, followed by coconut pudding with strawberries, and then some of the Devon Custard out of his Dad's bowl too! </p>
<p>They left for home while I cleaned the kitchen, before dashing over to their house to babysit Riku. Akane and Bryn left at 7:30 to see Brian Wilson in concert; Doug drove them to avoid parking hassles, and Riku and I played with his blocks in his room. Grandpa joined us for a good half hour after that; we made some neat building type things but were amazed at how well Riku could match everything up so it was perfectly balanced. </p>
<p>After such a busy day Riku was a tired little fellow; I put him into his pj's, brushed his teeth and we read two books... "Are You My Mother?" and "Goodnight Moon". Ten minutes later he was sound asleep, and then Doug and I promptly fell asleep at both ends of the sofa covered with a blanket! It was chilly and oh-so-comfortable under that blanket. </p>
<p>At 11 p.m., after an embarrassing wake-up call from Bryn, Doug went off to pick them up, and we headed home and to bed. The concert was terrific we were told.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/11/to_market_to_market.html">To Market, to Market...</a></h2>
								<p>This morning, before getting out of bed, I spent a few minutes thinking about Auntie Rita and her special place in my life. One year ago today we lost her and it's still often hard to believe. I had a rare morning cup of tea, toast with almost-the-end of Auntie Rita's perfect blackberry jam, and thought more good thoughts about my special times with her. </p>
<p>Bryn had a breakfast meeting this morning. It was a gorgeous sunny day, and the farmers' market was calling; Akane and Riku were happy to accompany us, but first I walked over to get Riku while his mom napped and showered. </p>
<p>We enjoyed our long leisurely stroll back here, inspecting all the various bits and pieces on the sidewalk and around the trees, finding a heart-shaped rock, and today's best find of all: a very unusual seed pod. Riku was a little worried about it at first, but was soon showing it off to Doug, along with a tiny red seed that fell out of it. </p>
<p>Oh, he stopped to wave to Lily, our local dry cleaning lady, and blew her a kiss too. This has become a ritual on our walk between Hampshire and Rhode Island Streets. </p>
<p>Riku had a big bowl of oatmeal and strawberries, played with his cars and trucks for a bit, and then settled in for a forty-five-minute nap. He decided at one point, just before closing his eyes, that he wanted to have a BM... and so up he got and sat on the toilet for a couple of minutes. I think it was just a delaying tactic and it worked. However, I don't want to discourage this behaviour at all; it's just starting to be of interest to him. </p>
<p>We picked Akane up and headed for the Alemany Market around noon; a few of the stalls had closed, but it's certainly a quieter and less crowded experience later in the day. There were lots of bargains too, as closing time drew nearer. I bought plenty of persimmons, ten small but very red and ripe organic pomegranates (wee Bryn and I share a passion for these), and some tiny newly picked red potatoes; Doug added cheese curds and Medjool dates. </p>
<p>Riku was tired and ready for some lunch and another nap when we dropped them off at 1:30; Doug and I headed off to a double feature at the Balboa...  a wonderfully acted British film called "Stage Beauty", about men playing the parts of women during Shakespearean times... and "p.s." which was a bit far-fetched but again wonderfully acted by Laura Linney. </p>
<p>We stopped for burritos on Mission Street on the way home, a favourite place where the burritos don't contain rice, and so are a little lighter. Perfect. </p>
<p>Home to emails and photo work on the computer... and back to my blog after a certain sister, who shall remain anonymous, wrote an email making me feel very guilty about my neglect the past few weeks...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/11/tiny_trains_in_berkeley.html">Tiny Trains in Berkeley</a></h2>
								<p>Akane and Bryn went out birthday shopping today for a certain little someone and so we got to spend a Sunday with Riku! What a treat, as there are many things to do in the city that are only available on the weekends in the winter months. Tilden Park in Berkeley is one of them. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped Riku off around 10 a.m. and said he was ready for his nap. Well, putting him to bed immediately wouldn't please Riku a bit, so I made him a bowl of porridge with strawberries and fed him while he sat at the table sorting out his cars. After a quick look at one of his picture books, he was more than happy to snuggle in with his bed buddies, and fell asleep within minutes. Riku has a little cold and obviously needed his sleep, as he slept for two hours! </p>
<p>I had told him, while putting him to bed, that when he woke up we were going on a train. After a lunch of soupy udon noodles, grated carrot, mushrooms, spinach, and tofu (which he really liked), plus three of his alphabet cookies, off we went! </p>
<p>The weather was perfect; cool enough for a jacket but sunny with a clear blue sky. We watched one train go by, and then went for a little walk down a ramp to another train yard. We have been there many times in the past with Bryn and Caillie but have never seen a train running down in this area. It is free and consists of a much smaller, very narrow "train" so we sat with our legs tucked in closely beside us, and off we went with an "all aboard" and a whistle. Riku was a little subdued with his cold but was obviously pleased as can be to be on the train. </p>
<p>We walked back up to the larger train, arriving just in time to get a place at the very front, with a great view of the engineer and the steam. A dog ran beside the train throughout the entire trip and Riku was as interested in the dog as he was in the train... except on the two occasions when we went through a tunnel. The whistle blew, the steam was escaping high into the trees, and Riku was fascinated with it all. </p>
<p>Following this adventure we went off to run a couple of errands, ending up at an IKEA store. I had hopes that Riku would be tired enough by this time to nap in his stroller but the store was just too big, too crowded, and too interesting for this. He played at a table and chair set with beads on wires, and had much fun playing in a short version of a bunk bed, with a slide to get down to the floor. </p>
<p>Riku was very entertaining in the car on the way both to and from Berkeley as he kept repeating "W, X, Y, and Z" over and over. It was very funny, as he just kept it up although started pronouncing "W" as "double-ee" which made me laugh. Doug and I sang the song "BINGO" to him which he liked very much, especially the clapping, and I sang "Down at the Station" to him, which Kelly and I used to sing to Bryn and Caillie at this age. </p>
<p>Back in the car I fed him some dinner and he had been snacking early on as well, so of course he fell asleep within two minutes of his house! Arggh! He took my hand and dropped off; I carried him into the house, changed his diaper, undressed him, and put him into his pajamas, with some help from his daddy. Riku was happy to see his mommy standing there, waiting to nurse him, and I left hoping he wouldn't get his "second wind" but would nurse and go to bed. His nose was running more towards the end of the day so we shall see how he is tomorrow. We'll spend most of the day at home and I have a surprise for him...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/11/a_quiet_day_with_riku.html">A Quiet Day with Riku</a></h2>
								<p>I walked over to pick up Riku just after 9 a.m. today. His cold is still with him, but we had our usual leisurely investigative stroll over to the house. </p>
<p>As soon as we got his shoes off and he said hello to Grandpa, Riku carried his now-very-heavy tin of cars to the mat in the kitchen and settled in for some time with his automobiles. At one point he walked over to Doug, who was at the computer, and said "Sit?" so Doug complied and joined Riku on the mat for some one-on-one guy time. </p>
<p>Despite his snuffly nose Riku ate a good sized portion of hot cereal with blueberries and strawberries, and then helped me squeeze fresh orange juice for him as well. We put a pillow under the head of his bed before his nap, and when I peeked in during his morning nap he was breathing easily. I also put a big bowl of hot water in his room, so that too may have helped; his cheeks were nice and rosy and he was snuggled in with one dog and his monkey.</p>
<p>Doug went off to mail a letter after lunch, and took Riku along with him for some fresh air. They were gone almost an hour! There is a house under construction just up the street, so Doug put Riku in the driver's seat of a digger, and they spent some time looking at the big hole, and the other equipment, before Riku insisted on walking up the concrete stairs (a very steep block!) to the next street up. There were dogs and pine needles and new territory to explore there too, and of course the stairs to walk down at the end of it all.</p>
<p>After his afternoon nap, Doug set up a circus-style tent in our bedroom for Riku. We bought this for Bryn and Caillie when we were in England, and I thought that Riku would enjoy it too. I was right! He and I sat down together inside, while he ate his snack of bunny crackers, orange juice, and freshly made applesauce. He pointed out the cloth triangles and the rectangles inside the tent; shapes are of great interest to him still. As Doug set up the tent we sat on the bed and looked at a book of shapes, so the timing was perfect for big rectangles and triangles! </p>
<p>Riku has taken a fancy to the West Coast Indian eagle plaque in our room and wants it down so that he can touch it, and say "Hi eagle!" to it. There is also one in his bedroom which he finds fascinating as well, and a stitched owl hanging that Kelly did when she was a teenager. It's fun to see which things they are drawn to at different periods of time. He had quite a long chat on the phone too, after pushing a lot of numbers and after I checked that he hadn't actually called Australia. </p>
<p>Our day passed far too quickly somehow. I managed to get all of the laundry done, made the applesauce, and cleaned out the fridge, while Riku played with his letters, discovered the chicken mobile in the living room (which he can reach by climbing onto the ottoman), and just generally kept busy with his cars and the plastic blocks upstairs in our bedroom. </p>
<p>At 6:30 we dropped Riku off at home; his nose seemed less runny in the afternoon, and I hope the cold will soon be gone. </p>
<p>Doug and I went off to a lecture at a travel store, given by a young woman who left her home in Australia seven years ago to travel the world on a folding bicycle. She was very interesting, and told lots of great stories as we watched a slide show of her three months in Cuba.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/11/a_november_sunday.html">A November Sunday...</a></h2>
								<p>Doug and I were both awake and showered early this morning in anticipation of breakfast at "Jim's" as suggested by Bryn last night. At 8 a.m. Doug left to pick up Akane, Bryn, and Riku, while I walked briskly over there, arriving just as they had all buckled up. </p>
<p>We sat in a big corner booth, with a view of busy Mission Street, and ordered eggs, toast, hash browns, in various forms... Bryn and I had regular plates while Akane and Bryn chose fried egg sandwiches. Riku nibbled on some of our potatoes and toast and ate some of the Cream of Wheat with berries I had prepared for him. I took along two of his new cars and Akane had a book for him so he was happy to sit while we ate. </p>
<p>They all went off for a little walk along the side streets while I walked home. I often don't get a walk in on the weekends and really miss and need it; they passed me just a few blocks from home. </p>
<p>We moved the rest of his gifts to the living room floor and watched while Riku tore open his gifts and then waited patiently for the puzzles, tub of blocks, and cars to be taken out of their plastic wrappings. Once again, Riku reminds me so much of Bryn at this age, as he is so happy concentrating on whatever gift he has just opened that the gifts take a long time to open. He looks at each book carefully and starts to build towers with the new blocks, which was just fine; his dad helped him and we had a leisurely hour doing just that. </p>
<p>Riku was ready for his morning nap by then, and Doug and I read the paper, checked and answered some emails, and went off to an afternoon movie "Motorcycle Diaries", which was excellent. I had Doug drop me off at Hampshire Street as I thought Riku might like some time at the playground. He was watching a video but was very happy to put his shoes on and join me. It was busy there, with lots of children in the sandboxes and on the equipment. Riku did a little climbing and happily carried around a little car we found there. He kicked a ball around the big field too, which he loves to do, so he had lots of running around time. We were gone from 4:30 until 5:45, and it was dark when we walked home. This made airplane and moon watching very easy and Riku enjoys just sauntering along in the night, stopping to rest now and then on a stoop or two. </p>
<p>Akane sent me home with three freshly made inari, so I scarfed one down on the way, and since Doug and I weren't very hungry I put the other two on our plates along with the leftover Chinese food Akane had made on Friday night for us all. I had finished up the noodles yesterday, had them all to myself!, so we had delicious sweet and sour vegetables, lemon duck and the inari. </p>
<p>We finished off the day with a taped video, "NYPD" and I actually managed to see it all the way through, even if it was only 9 p.m. when we finished it! I'm heading off to bed now in anticipation of a very early morning.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/11/all_day_with_riku.html">All Day with Riku</a></h2>
								<p>Doug woke me at 4:15 this morning to drive him to the airport; he will be in Texas for five days. I had put two hot bed buddies in the bed before I left and managed to get back to sleep for an hour and a bit, before waking in time to talk with Glenn, Beth, and Gail on Skype. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped Riku off at 9:15; Riku was carrying a little paper shopping bag over his arm, with some of his new birthday cards in it, looking just like a little ol' shopper... adorable. Many of his birthday gifts had been left here and so he had a great time looking through all the books, with me beside him on the sofa. </p>
<p>When we finished those, Riku went back to his cars and new cars, right on the mat in front of the kitchen sink, his favourite spot to play. Often if I'm busy in the eating area with laundry or some paper work,  Riku will pick up his cars and move over to that area to join me, a whole two feet away. He's very much like his dad was at that age, and likes to be with someone, even if he's not directly interacting with them. </p>
<p>Riku had a nice long nap today, after a big bowl of cereal and some toast. His cold has almost gone, but he's a little stuffy still. I put a pillow under the top of the mattress, put in a big bowl of steamy water, and he slept for one and a half hours. </p>
<p>Bryn had IMed asking if he could come for lunch and bring a co-worker, so I made some grilled cheese sandwiches, cut up some vegies, and met Ted, a personable, low-key, and gentle guy. Riku woke up in time to join us at the table, getting to know Ted while eating his noodle and vegie soup, along with a long whole wheat breadstick, which he really likes. </p>
<p>After lunch, and more laundry, I packed up some snacks and we drove off to a little playground in Golden Gate Park. Riku was so happy climbing up and down the toddler-sized stairs, hanging on carefully to the railings as he did so. There were many levels and he was at it for about thirty minutes non-stop before he spotted 'melia and Susan. I had left a message for Susan, hoping they might stop by, and it was fun spending some time with both children at once. </p>
<p>I had taken bubbles with me and that was a big hit; Riku plowed through them, chasing after them, and squealing out loud with delight at it all. Amelia stomped on them and tried to pick them up, and three other children joined in the fun as well. Riku eventually wandered off to study the plants and long grass on the opposite side of the play area, while Amelia kept Susan busy clambering after her. Amelia shows no hesitation at all about being able to climb up stairs that are very steep for her little legs, and just goes for it. She is such fun to watch as she is just busy, busy, busy!</p>
<p>Riku went down a big slide today all on his own. I had been off to the side a bit and another mom was standing there watching her child and Riku up on the platform. I turned to go over to him and there he was, sliding down, as though he had been at it for ages. Riku has been pretty careful on slides as he bumped his head once a while back, and usually treads carefully. Guess he's over that!  </p>
<p>After Susan and Amelia left for home, I put Riku in the stroller for a walk around Stow Lake. I thought he might nap for a bit, after all the exercise, fresh air, and eating every snack I had with me, but he found the lake, the ducks pecking away right beside the path, and the other birds swimming by just too intriguing to miss. I must take him there more often as he was so happy sitting watching them quack, eat,  and interact with each other. </p>
<p>It was dark by the time I bundled him into the car seat (5:30) and he snoozed on the half hour trip home. I had promised him time upstairs with the tent and the cars and so up we went, after making a cup of fresh orange juice and heating up some dinner for him. Riku sat on the bed exploring some wooden puzzle boxes while I fed him broccoli, carrot sticks, and polenta with tiny bits of "chicken" made from flavoured tofu. I was quite sure there wasn't going to be enough time for a bath for him, so instead asked him if he would like to play in the sink. We came downstairs and he went immediately to the plastics drawer, pulled out a cup and a container, and asked for a chair. That kept him busy and happy for almost a half hour while he stirred and poured to his heart's content. </p>
<p>It was a nice relaxing end to a relaxing day. Akane called just after 7 p.m. to say she was leaving the studio, so I dressed Riku and we set off to meet her. Riku was once again carrying his little shopping bag with cars, refusing to allow me to put in the three lemons he and his Dad had picked the day before. His new book on trucks couldn't go in either; Riku has his own sense of what is appropriate and allowed me to carry the bag after a few minutes, while he managed the book. </p>
<p>I was back home at 8 p.m. and tired from my early morning, and I suppose all that fresh air and exercise too! Kelly suggested that I make a bowl of oatmeal for my dinner... I was hungry but it was late, so I did just that, adding some raisins and cranberries to it, and ate sitting in the living room, finishing off one of my Oprah magazines... a very relaxing end to my day. Lights out at 11 p.m. after folding one more load of laundry and putting in another... </p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/11/a_late_afternoon_walk_with_ame.html">A Late Afternoon Walk with Amelia</a></h2>
								<p>Started off my day by chatting with Glenn, Gail, Candy, and Beth: a lovely way to begin this bright Tuesday morning. Gail had found a couple of Hawai'i hotels for us to look at, and after deciding we really couldn't afford the one we stayed at in 1999, I got into a hotel chat room (first time for everything!) and ended up booking a room for us at the Ohana Waikiki East... a one-bedroom suite with kitchenette, for just $89 a night! Yahoo! It's done, and now we can all relax, knowing we have a place to stay. </p>
<p>This took a lot longer than I thought it would, and so I didn't get at the ironing, but did manage to finish off the laundry, and get a few other small chores done in the kitchen and dining room. Lots to do but not lots of time for any of it. Ah well... </p>
<p>At 2:30 I drove over to Susan's and Kevin's for a walk with Amelia. Susan thought she would nap for an hour and a bit, but she was asleep three minutes after I picked her up, and slept for two hours and twenty minutes! I took my time and walked the long way to Stow Lake, around lots of paths, past the flower conservatory, through the rose garden, and twice around the lake, clockwise (a first!) both times.  Funny how one gets into a routine, and today it was time to shake things up and see the view from a different angle! Gail said she would like to do this walk when she and Candy are here in February, and I thought as I walked along how much both of them would enjoy it. </p>
<p>It was dark when Amelia woke at 6:45, but there was a bright quarter- moon and I pointed out to her. She is a "Goodnight Moon" fan too, and quickly caught on to just what that bright object in the sky was. Every time it could be seen between the eucalyptus branches, Amelia would point up to it and make sure that I noticed too. I'm sure there is a sign for the word "moon", and no doubt she will have it down pat the next time I see her. </p>
<p>After such a long nap, I hope that she doesn't keep her mom and dad up too late tonight! She was in bed at 7 p.m. last night but that isn't going to be the case tonight for certain. Susan may never have me walk her again; she says that I have more luck getting Amelia to sleep for long stroller rides than anyone else, but I'm not sure that is a good thing so late in the day. </p>
<p>I had thought about dropping by Hampshire Street to take Riku for a stroll in the dark, but had second thoughts about it..  perhaps his dad would be home for dinner by the time I got there. I called after  arriving home, and sure enough, Bryn was there. </p>
<p>Just as well I didn't, as I was very hungry after my long stroll, put an Amy's frozen pizza in the oven, made a big cup of tea, and sat upstairs catching up on a couple of taped Oprahs. It was just what I needed, and I still have some energy left over to get a few more things done tonight.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/11/sf_zoo_with_amelia_and_riku.html">SF Zoo with Amelia and Riku</a></h2>
								<p>What a perfectly wonderful day this was! At 9:30 a.m. Riku and I headed off to the zoo to meet up with Susan and Amelia. Riku was asleep about five minutes after we left the house, two cars clenched in his hands, and his one dog tucked beside his head in the car seat. Susan and I met at our designated spot in the parking lot, both with children sleeping soundly. Both woke up around 10:40 and off we went for a three-hour adventure. </p>
<p>First up was Amelia's favourite place... the petting zoo. Riku was a little nervous when he first spotted all the big sheep and many goats, with long horns, wandering about, but he soon got used to them and was bold enough to pat them as they came close to him. Amelia is an old hand at this and shows no fear at all. </p>
<p>Riku was quite fascinated with the salt lick in the barn and kept disappearing in there to have another look at it. Chickens meandered about, there were ducks and geese in the pond, and it was just like a storybook come to life. We were there for quite a long time and after a few tractor rides on wee tractors (or pushing them about), we decided it was lunch time. Susan recommended eating at a table outside by the flamingos which kept the children interested while they ate their lunches. </p>
<p>Next came a train ride, which is one of Riku's very favourite things in the world right now... that and tunnels, and we were lucky enough that a tunnel was part of our trip. The conductor even said "All Aboard!" which Riku now says frequently (since the Tildon train ride two weekends ago), never failing to make us smile. </p>
<p>We saw... two giraffes, monkeys, love birds, meerkats, a zebra, gorillas (my favourites), and an owl, Riku's very favourite. He was so happy running and walking up and down all the various pathways, but was willing to be guided along to the next spot on the trip. Riku often just squeals with delight as he runs along and we get lots of smiles directed at him when he does this. </p>
<p>Amelia has a little cold starting and was more than ready for a nap, so she and Susan left us after the gorillas. Riku wanted to "see owl?" again, so we headed off, stopping first at the carousel for a long ride on a horse; perhaps next time he will choose the cat with a fish in its mouth, as he spent a long time admiring it as he rode along. I don't think Riku stopped grinning the entire time he was on the ride. </p>
<p>There is a wide area of grass where birds of prey are out in the open; some of the birds have been injured and some were born in captivity, but the hawks and a few of the others are tethered to large poles. An owl was one of them and Riku was happy to stand and stare at him, as he turned his head around and around. Another plus was a guide standing with a snake wrapped around her hand. Riku was reluctant to touch it when she first suggested doing so, but soon decided he would go for it, and did! He touched it twice, with just two fingers, on the smooth soft topside of the snake, and then the even smoother underbelly. He was quite fascinated with its tiny tongue flicking in and out as well. </p>
<p>By the time we reached the parking lot Riku's eyes were droopy and he was asleep the instant I put him in the car seat. Ocean Beach was just too tempting to pass by, so I drove down a few blocks and parked the car where I had a wonderful view of crashing waves and blue skies. Riku napped for an hour and a half! and I read and dozed a bit myself in the warm sunshine. </p>
<p>We had enough time for a stroll on the beach, before heading for home, so stroll we did. It was just perfect as the sun was still warm but close to setting. Riku just wandered about on the hard packed sand near the edge of the water, picked up lots of sand, seashells, ocean grasses, and inspected little pink claws lying about. We left for home just as the sun disappeared into the ocean, and Riku happily snacked on dried fruit on the way. Riku pointed out all the letters he could see from the back seat, all lit up in the dark and so easy for him to read. </p>
<p>Once we were home, I gave him a choice of either a bath or time upstairs and upstairs we went, much to my surprise. I heated some pasta with pesto and tomato for him, and took up a bowl of applesauce for dessert as well; I fed him while he sat on the bed, inspecting some of his favourite things... my tiny wooden heart-shaped jewelry box and one of his Grandpa's puzzle boxes, which holds a name tag (Riku now says "Doug Dyment" when he picks it up!) and chatted about the snake, and the owl, and the eagle carving in my room, which he likes as much as the stitches wall hanging of an owl that Kelly made for me many many years ago. </p>
<p>He now knows that "Auntie Kelly" made that; we have been practicing the names of all the people he is going to see next week. How I will miss him for those nine days away! Thank goodness Amelia is not going away for the Thanksgiving holdiay; her big smiles and hugs are irresistable too.</p>
<p>Early bedtime for me tonight, as Riku will be here with me in the morning...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/11/pudding_and_good_night_amelia.html">Pudding? ... and Good Night Amelia</a></h2>
								<p>I walked over to pick up Riku at 9:30 this morning and we had our usual leisurely stroll back to our house. Riku started giving his mom a two handed wave over the past couple of weeks; we stop to look up at Akane in the window, and they wave to each other with both hands. It's adorable; we stop twice before continuing on our way. </p>
<p>Now we also stop at Lily's, the dry cleaner, so that Riku can tap on the window and give her a big smile and blow her a kiss.  </p>
<p>The fork lift truck was in action this morning and so we paused long enough to watch the driver pick up some big lengths of wood from the house building site and place it on the flat ground down on our street. The driver was so friendly, gave Riku a big smile and a wave as well. Riku is quite taken with big machinery these days, so the new house has been a source of much pleasure lately. </p>
<p>Usually when Riku walks in the house his first word is either "Grandpa?" or "cars?" He knows that Grandpa is not home this week so today the word, much to my surprise was not "cars?" but "pudding?" It was so unexpected! I had taken rice pudding to the zoo yesterday, and he had eaten his little bowl full, but I didn't expect him to remember it or to ask for more. Luckily, I had filled one of the little Tupperware toy bowls with some at the last minute, before handing the bowl over to his dad that morning to take to work, so he sat down and had that for a breakfast appetizer. A half hour later he had his first "French toast" and really liked it. He is often not that fond of eggs and this seemed a good way to get some protein into him. The little trickle of maple syrup was a big hit too. A strawberry Vitamin C booster was his beverage this morning, a change from the freshly squeezed juice we usually make together. </p>
<p>Riku spent lots of time playing with his cars this morning, and before his nap we went through four of his new birthday books on the sofa. We talked about our trip to the zoo yesterday as well; we went over all the animals he saw and as he played with an elephant from his basket he repeated after me as close as he could come today... "epelent?" </p>
<p>Riku does enjoy hearing about things he has done in the past and nods solemnly when it's obvious he remembers. We talked about his patting a goat and a sheep yesterday, and he reminded me about the owls he saw, and the snake. It's getting to be such fun as more and more often we have little conversations about his days. </p>
<p>Today while carrying him down the stairs he spotted a dust web hanging from a grid in the ceiling. "Uh oh!" says he as he pointed it out; it took me a minute to see it, as it wasn't very obvious, but we went over and got a long broom from the kitchen and brushed it down. This is a boy who likes order in his life. The cars get lined up carefully, the cookies just so on his plate, and everything tidied up as he finishes playing with it... almost always. </p>
<p>After lunch (a big bowl of pesto with mushrooms, carrots, and broccoli bits, a bowl of applesauce and a small alphabet cookie), Riku asked "Riku go to park", followed by "Nana moko?" (as close as I can tell) and of course I agreed that I too would be going. We took the stroller over and he spent some time in the little room at the playground, just wandering in and out of the plastic dome there, and practicing putting the ball into the hoop. There was just enough time for him to "run, run, run?" in the field before heading home for a short afternoon nap. He wanted to be held for the longest time today after his nap; it was interesting, as we must have snuggled for about fifteen minutes before he was willing to climb down from my lap and get busy again. Not typical behavior at all but I enjoyed every minute of it.</p>
<p>At 6:40 I dropped him off at home with his mom, and immediately drove to Ashbury Street for my first night-time sitting with Amelia. Kevin and Susan went out for dinner tonight after I volunteered to put Amelia to bed. Kevin had her all bathed and I gave her a little massage with some body lotion, which she relaxed with, and enjoyed. Amelia doesn't lie still for too many things! </p>
<p>After her mom and dad left, we read three stories, she turned out her light, and we settled in, settling her down. Her cold made it hard for her to breathe, but the humidifier was going, she was cozy and snuggly in her sleeper blanket, and was tired from an undoubtedly busy day. </p>
<p>It took a bit of rocking, stroking her back, and reminding her to keep her head down, but Amelia finally just settled in and let herself fall off to sleep. I tiptoed out, and read for an hour and a bit before Susan and Kevin tiptoed in. She awoke about ten minutes after they got home, and so I settled her again and slipped out the door, leaving three sleepy people ready for the night. A lovely day this was! I was in bed too within a half hour of arriving home.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/11/au_revoir_riku_akane_and_bryn.html">Au Revoir Riku, Akane, and Bryn</a></h2>
								<p>Today is my last day with Riku for nine days. He and his parents are off to Ontario for a visit with friends and family. I have been talking to Riku for over a week about his going on a plane with Mommy and Daddy and telling him no, that I won't be going and no, Grandpa won't be going either. Now he tells me "p'ane, Riku, Daddy, Mommy, not Nana, not Gandpa" so it's all clear to him now. I have also been showing him photos of some of the people he will be seeing. Yesterday and today he sat on my lap for the longest time at the computer while I showed him over and over... Auntie Kelly, Uncle Gregg, Myk', Bryn, Bryant, and Caillie... and Uncle Frank, Auntie Beth, and Manitou too! He repeated all the names after me and does a great job with all of them. It will be interesting to see how he does with them while he's there.</p>
<p>Akane put him in front of the TV this morning and cut his hair while he was distracted. When I picked him up at 10:30 he looked just adorable. Akane does a great job with his hair and I love it when it's shorter; I guess that little face is just easier to see!</p>
<p>Today we stopped in to say goodbye to Lily, to tell her he was going to Toronto, and she asked if he was going to see Kelly; What a good memory she has! Lily talks very loudly and comes quite close when she's talking; she once made wee Bryn cry as he had never had anyone quite that much "in his face" before, but Riku just beams away at her and I believe he has won her heart.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I started playing the Raffi <em>Baby Beluga</em> CD for Riku and he is already a fan. Today he asked "baby 'buga?" when he walked in the door, so I put it on repeat. Whenever he realized that it wasn't that song playing he would raise those eyebrows at me and ask me for it again. We danced together to it once or twice with Riku in my arms, something he so enjoys doing. What a happy little boy this is.</p>
<p>The painters have taken the paper covering off the windows and today Riku climbed up on the ottoman to get a better and closer look at them at work. They smiled and waved at him which made him very happy, and he kept himself busy watching for about ten minutes.</p>
<p>Our intention was to go to see the sea lions today at Pier 39, but Riku napped for two plus hours, one of the longest naps he has had here. He also ate a big breakfast again, and that may have helped get him through what normally would have been his lunch time.</p>
<p>We did all of his favourite things today... went upstairs while he took apart Doug's puzzle box and investigated all the pins and name tags in it, sat in his tent and played with his plastic train set, and later sat on the rug in the kitchen playing with his cars while I ironed and finished it all off. Bryn had dropped off some laundry of theirs today, so that was done up and ironed as well.</p>
<p>Time for some outdoor activity so we headed off to the playground again. Once again he found the door open to the junior play room and played with a little girl and a little boy, not always happy when they absconded with the ball or the bead set. However, they left before we did so he had lots of time with them on his own too.</p>
<p>Back at home Riku asked for "pen? paper?" and kept himself busy for a half hour drawing almost perfect little circles and at one point carefully making a mark and then looking at me and saying very seriously... "e". However, Riku drew on the table for the first time today and on the windowsill yesterday; he didn't do these things until he turned two so I wonder if he has been sneak reading about the "terrible twos" and feeling he had better get going!</p>
<p>Riku snacked on some dried fruit and pine nuts on the way home and I popped him into the tub. I wanted to wash his hair in case there were any tickly bits on his skin from his hair cut this morning. He loves his tub so much and it was the perfect way to end his day here.</p>
<p>At 7:30 I drove him home and we played with his new Brio train set in his room while his mom and dad dashed about doing last minute packing.  Finally we were all set to leave at 8:15 for the airport, Riku fell asleep two minutes into the trip, and was transported successfully into his stroller when we arrived there. There was time for Akane and Bryn to have a burger and some fries (which I helped with!) before heading to the gate and our goodbyes. The stroller had to go through the xray machine and so Riku had to be lifted out; he was just barely awake in his dad's arms when I kissed him goodbye.</p>
<p>Off they went on another adventure and I went home to wait for Doug's plane to arrive, due just an hour and a half later. There was a message waiting on the answering machine that Doug would not be in tonight after all, and after a missed connection would be spending the night at the L.A. airport, leaving instead at 6:20 a.m. for SF! Off I go to bed. Doug called just as I got upstairs; he is not expecting a good night's sleep!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/11/shes_a_dancing_queen.html">She's a Dancing Queen</a></h2>
								<p>Today was laundry day and after a few minutes of Skying with my sisters, I put in the second load of clothes and awaited the call from Susan, telling me they are on their way over. At 10:10 we started off on our walk and Amelia was sleeping soundly by 10:20 a.m. I walked out to the far end of Mission Street before heading back towards our end, picking up some bananas, and walking to Rainbow for butter. Amelia is managing lately to not respond to every loud noise by waking up, which is good, as the streets are not as quiet as the park! </p>
<p>On the way home, Amelia sat up nice and tall in the stroller, pointing out almost every tree we passed. She likes me to let her know each time and yes, indeed, that one too is a tree. I stopped in for some Russian piroshki; they were huge, and I bought only six of them, instead of the dozen I ordered, plus a very large mushroom and pesto turnover which could easily feed two people. </p>
<p>Amelia was ready for lunch and ate all the quiche and sweet potato her mom had packed for her, plus home made applesauce, and polishing off a couple of dozen pinto and black beans from my leftover burrito! Her cold is hanging in there, and I was surprised she ate as much as she did. Amelia took great delight in throwing books and magazines off the table when she had finished looking at them, and then saying "uh oh!" and looking down at them, as though it had been a big accident. Adorable. </p>
<p>After lunch was playtime and Amelia was happy to explore. Every time I went in the laundry room she found a new toy to play with... the popping pusher, the buzzing bee pusher, the press-on spinner thingie, and the penguin. Amelia used to be quite nervous of the penguin; it is loud and moves in erratic fashion but today she seemed to enjoy it, although at one point was walking backwards very successfully away from it, when it seemed to be gaining on her! </p>
<p>I put Raffi on for her to listen to and as soon as she realized music was playing started moving her body around and around, turning in circles, and "dancing" until the song ended. It was the cutest thing, and Doug and I just watched her until she stopped. </p>
<p>Once in a while throughout the afternoon, she would approach Doug making it clear that he was to pick her up, and so he did. Then she would point things out to him keeping him interested in holding her just a little longer. So funny to see this going on! </p>
<p>Susan picked Amelia up at 2:45; Doug and I left at 3 p.m. for a movie at Stonestown, "Enduring Love". I had "earned" a free popcorn with my ticket, so was a happy camper sitting there munching away on a small bag of my favourite movie treat. I was tired going into the movie and in fact had drifted off while reading in the car before going into the theatre. However, I stayed awake for the movie (it was a bit creepy so no doubt that was part of it) and enjoyed just relaxing in the middle of the day. </p>
<p>Doug and I went right home, he worked on some photos for my blogs, and  I caught up on more emails while he watched a taped show. I would have fallen asleep anyway as it was on from 10-11 and I am tired... night night!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/11/another_day_with_amelia.html">Another Day with Amelia</a></h2>
								<p>Gial, Beth, and I were on Skype this morning for a bit; I ironed three shirts while Beth filled me in on her visit with Akane, Bryn, and Riku over lunch at her house yesterday. Sounds like he had a fun couple of hours there, with toys and investigating the house! </p>
<p>Kelly phoned this morning; I said hello to Riku and caught up with what he has been doing to keep busy... playing the piano, saying "hi!" in a big voice to Manitou when he walks by him, walked the children to school today with his Dad and Auntie Kelly, and asked Kelly for breakfast... a first! Kelly says he loves going upstairs to play with the boys cars in their room. I know how much he loves company so must be in his glory. He also went to the ROM with his parents during the afternoon.</p>
<p>How lovely to have Amelia over here with me two days in a row! Susan dropped off a sleepy girl at 9:45 and we put her right into the stroller to continue the nap she just started in the car. Alas, that was enough to tide her over for a bit, and she just drifted in and out of sleep for the next hour and a half. I had decided to walk to Van Ness and Sutter instead of walking around the Mission once more. There was a lot of construction going on, noisy motorcycles, big trucks hauling big loads, which meant lots of noise from them, street cleaning machines, impatient drivers honking horns, and lots of people talking very loudly as they passed by, all of which managed to get Amelia's attention. Finally, at 11:30 Amelia fell into a deep sleep and dozed all the way back home; I walked slowly and she managed another hour and twenty minutes. </p>
<p>Amelia didn't have much of an appetite today, but her nose is very stuffy today and I can see why food wouldn't hold much interest for her. Despite that though she had a grand time playing with lots of toys that were new to her upstairs. She loves going up and down the stairs and exploring Riku's room, playing on the bed with the animals, and today would throw herself down onto the pillows, struggle to sit up, just to do it all over again. </p>
<p>Susan was here to pick her up at 3:15, arriving with a gorgeous bright orange bouquet of flowers, big enough to fill two vases! </p>
<p>Doug left an hour later for a dinner meeting in the East Bay; I went upstairs to watch a couple of Oprah taped shows whilst eating the mushroom and pesto pie... soooo good!, and enjoying a hot cup of tea.  This was enough to give me a second wind and I came downstairs and got busy cleaning out the fridge, making up a big bowl of fruit salad, some rice pudding for Doug, and cooking mushrooms to freeze for Riku's return next week. Managed to get lots done with my free evening! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/11/what_a_gorgeous_day.html">What a Gorgeous Day!</a></h2>
								<p>No one was on Skype today, much to my surprise which was just as well, since I had to leave the house at 8:45 for my walk with Amelia. Susan left for her massage appointment at 9:35 and Amelia was asleep five minutes later. </p>
<p>The park crew was stringing up Christmas lights on a huge tree just inside the park, and the gardeners were planting small ornamental Christmas trees in big buckets near the Conservatory, all wearing shorts and t-shirts on this beautiful perfect fall day. I had worn a light jacket and socks with my sandals and a half hour into the walk I stopped to remove them. I thought it was like a late May day in Ontario but with flowers blooming already... lovely! </p>
<p>I did walk through the rose garden and was lucky enough to spot a rainbow created by a sprinkler at the lake. There were lots of us out enjoying the weather and I did my now-usual walk twice around the lake while Amelia slept. Unfortunately, there were some very noisy gulls at the far end of the lake and an hour and twenty minutes into her nap, they woke Amelia up. She just didn't drift back to sleep after that although it was obvious soon after we arrived home that she was still sleepy. One thing she did on the way home though was shrug and put both hands up in the air when I asked her if she remembered seeing the moon the other night; we both looked up and I shrugged and said "where is the moon" and Amelia immediately copied me and continued to do so on the way home. </p>
<p>Amelia made up for yesterday at noon and ate a huge lunch today... broccoli quiche, brown rice with spinach, cornmeal, avocado with nori, mango and grapes, and I was just about to get her a second tiny piece of pie when Susan walked in. Susan told me she ate a great dinner last night too, so our guess is this cold will soon be over. </p>
<p>Amelia gives her mommy big hugs when she sees her, and then did a little "round-about" dance for us, picked up a large empty plastic container and walked around the house with it, had me "read" about five different books to her, backing up to me to sit as she chose each one, and just generally being her very busy self. Amelia is a mover and a shaker for sure... we call her our little steamroller... she just keeps going.  </p>
<p>I stayed for tea and to eat three! inari Susan had bought for me... one of my favourite foods in the world (Amelia liked it too), and we shared a pain au chocolate. Yum! Susan sent me home with a bag full of goodies... a whole pumpkin pie, the rest of the inari and a container of agedashi (tofu), and an apple turnover and another pain au chocolate to share with Doug... maybe! </p>
<p>Feeling lazy when I got home, I went up and read my book for a half hour before coming downstairs and getting started clearing out the front bedroom of Akane and Riku's belongings. They will be moved over to their place during the next few days, as I hope to have twin beds set up within a week or two. </p>
<p>Marie called and we had a nice long chat, catching up on our news from the past two months. This meant we had dinner later than usual, but that was fine; I had eaten my lunch a little later than usual today. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a couple of taped shows and now it's up to bed so that I'm rested for a full day of cleaning and clearing out tomorrow. </p>
<p>News from Toronto: Kelly and Riku had a lovely long visit alone today as Akane and Bryn went off to a movie and a lunch out together. I know that Kelly is going to miss that little boy so much when he leaves her.</p>
