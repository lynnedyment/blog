								<h2>What a Gorgeous Day!</h2>
								<p>No one was on Skype today, much to my surprise which was just as well, since I had to leave the house at 8:45 for my walk with Amelia. Susan left for her massage appointment at 9:35 and Amelia was asleep five minutes later. </p>
<p>The park crew was stringing up Christmas lights on a huge tree just inside the park, and the gardeners were planting small ornamental Christmas trees in big buckets near the Conservatory, all wearing shorts and t-shirts on this beautiful perfect fall day. I had worn a light jacket and socks with my sandals and a half hour into the walk I stopped to remove them. I thought it was like a late May day in Ontario but with flowers blooming already... lovely! </p>
<p>I did walk through the rose garden and was lucky enough to spot a rainbow created by a sprinkler at the lake. There were lots of us out enjoying the weather and I did my now-usual walk twice around the lake while Amelia slept. Unfortunately, there were some very noisy gulls at the far end of the lake and an hour and twenty minutes into her nap, they woke Amelia up. She just didn't drift back to sleep after that although it was obvious soon after we arrived home that she was still sleepy. One thing she did on the way home though was shrug and put both hands up in the air when I asked her if she remembered seeing the moon the other night; we both looked up and I shrugged and said "where is the moon" and Amelia immediately copied me and continued to do so on the way home. </p>
<p>Amelia made up for yesterday at noon and ate a huge lunch today... broccoli quiche, brown rice with spinach, cornmeal, avocado with nori, mango and grapes, and I was just about to get her a second tiny piece of pie when Susan walked in. Susan told me she ate a great dinner last night too, so our guess is this cold will soon be over. </p>
<p>Amelia gives her mommy big hugs when she sees her, and then did a little "round-about" dance for us, picked up a large empty plastic container and walked around the house with it, had me "read" about five different books to her, backing up to me to sit as she chose each one, and just generally being her very busy self. Amelia is a mover and a shaker for sure... we call her our little steamroller... she just keeps going.  </p>
<p>I stayed for tea and to eat three! inari Susan had bought for me... one of my favourite foods in the world (Amelia liked it too), and we shared a pain au chocolate. Yum! Susan sent me home with a bag full of goodies... a whole pumpkin pie, the rest of the inari and a container of agedashi (tofu), and an apple turnover and another pain au chocolate to share with Doug... maybe! </p>
<p>Feeling lazy when I got home, I went up and read my book for a half hour before coming downstairs and getting started clearing out the front bedroom of Akane and Riku's belongings. They will be moved over to their place during the next few days, as I hope to have twin beds set up within a week or two. </p>
<p>Marie called and we had a nice long chat, catching up on our news from the past two months. This meant we had dinner later than usual, but that was fine; I had eaten my lunch a little later than usual today. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a couple of taped shows and now it's up to bed so that I'm rested for a full day of cleaning and clearing out tomorrow. </p>
<p>News from Toronto: Kelly and Riku had a lovely long visit alone today as Akane and Bryn went off to a movie and a lunch out together. I know that Kelly is going to miss that little boy so much when he leaves her.</p>
