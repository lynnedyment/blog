								<h2>A Late Afternoon Walk with Amelia</h2>
								<p>Started off my day by chatting with Glenn, Gail, Candy, and Beth: a lovely way to begin this bright Tuesday morning. Gail had found a couple of Hawai'i hotels for us to look at, and after deciding we really couldn't afford the one we stayed at in 1999, I got into a hotel chat room (first time for everything!) and ended up booking a room for us at the Ohana Waikiki East... a one-bedroom suite with kitchenette, for just $89 a night! Yahoo! It's done, and now we can all relax, knowing we have a place to stay. </p>
<p>This took a lot longer than I thought it would, and so I didn't get at the ironing, but did manage to finish off the laundry, and get a few other small chores done in the kitchen and dining room. Lots to do but not lots of time for any of it. Ah well... </p>
<p>At 2:30 I drove over to Susan's and Kevin's for a walk with Amelia. Susan thought she would nap for an hour and a bit, but she was asleep three minutes after I picked her up, and slept for two hours and twenty minutes! I took my time and walked the long way to Stow Lake, around lots of paths, past the flower conservatory, through the rose garden, and twice around the lake, clockwise (a first!) both times.  Funny how one gets into a routine, and today it was time to shake things up and see the view from a different angle! Gail said she would like to do this walk when she and Candy are here in February, and I thought as I walked along how much both of them would enjoy it. </p>
<p>It was dark when Amelia woke at 6:45, but there was a bright quarter- moon and I pointed out to her. She is a "Goodnight Moon" fan too, and quickly caught on to just what that bright object in the sky was. Every time it could be seen between the eucalyptus branches, Amelia would point up to it and make sure that I noticed too. I'm sure there is a sign for the word "moon", and no doubt she will have it down pat the next time I see her. </p>
<p>After such a long nap, I hope that she doesn't keep her mom and dad up too late tonight! She was in bed at 7 p.m. last night but that isn't going to be the case tonight for certain. Susan may never have me walk her again; she says that I have more luck getting Amelia to sleep for long stroller rides than anyone else, but I'm not sure that is a good thing so late in the day. </p>
<p>I had thought about dropping by Hampshire Street to take Riku for a stroll in the dark, but had second thoughts about it..  perhaps his dad would be home for dinner by the time I got there. I called after  arriving home, and sure enough, Bryn was there. </p>
<p>Just as well I didn't, as I was very hungry after my long stroll, put an Amy's frozen pizza in the oven, made a big cup of tea, and sat upstairs catching up on a couple of taped Oprahs. It was just what I needed, and I still have some energy left over to get a few more things done tonight.</p>
