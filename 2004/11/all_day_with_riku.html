								<h2>All Day with Riku</h2>
								<p>Doug woke me at 4:15 this morning to drive him to the airport; he will be in Texas for five days. I had put two hot bed buddies in the bed before I left and managed to get back to sleep for an hour and a bit, before waking in time to talk with Glenn, Beth, and Gail on Skype. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped Riku off at 9:15; Riku was carrying a little paper shopping bag over his arm, with some of his new birthday cards in it, looking just like a little ol' shopper... adorable. Many of his birthday gifts had been left here and so he had a great time looking through all the books, with me beside him on the sofa. </p>
<p>When we finished those, Riku went back to his cars and new cars, right on the mat in front of the kitchen sink, his favourite spot to play. Often if I'm busy in the eating area with laundry or some paper work,  Riku will pick up his cars and move over to that area to join me, a whole two feet away. He's very much like his dad was at that age, and likes to be with someone, even if he's not directly interacting with them. </p>
<p>Riku had a nice long nap today, after a big bowl of cereal and some toast. His cold has almost gone, but he's a little stuffy still. I put a pillow under the top of the mattress, put in a big bowl of steamy water, and he slept for one and a half hours. </p>
<p>Bryn had IMed asking if he could come for lunch and bring a co-worker, so I made some grilled cheese sandwiches, cut up some vegies, and met Ted, a personable, low-key, and gentle guy. Riku woke up in time to join us at the table, getting to know Ted while eating his noodle and vegie soup, along with a long whole wheat breadstick, which he really likes. </p>
<p>After lunch, and more laundry, I packed up some snacks and we drove off to a little playground in Golden Gate Park. Riku was so happy climbing up and down the toddler-sized stairs, hanging on carefully to the railings as he did so. There were many levels and he was at it for about thirty minutes non-stop before he spotted 'melia and Susan. I had left a message for Susan, hoping they might stop by, and it was fun spending some time with both children at once. </p>
<p>I had taken bubbles with me and that was a big hit; Riku plowed through them, chasing after them, and squealing out loud with delight at it all. Amelia stomped on them and tried to pick them up, and three other children joined in the fun as well. Riku eventually wandered off to study the plants and long grass on the opposite side of the play area, while Amelia kept Susan busy clambering after her. Amelia shows no hesitation at all about being able to climb up stairs that are very steep for her little legs, and just goes for it. She is such fun to watch as she is just busy, busy, busy!</p>
<p>Riku went down a big slide today all on his own. I had been off to the side a bit and another mom was standing there watching her child and Riku up on the platform. I turned to go over to him and there he was, sliding down, as though he had been at it for ages. Riku has been pretty careful on slides as he bumped his head once a while back, and usually treads carefully. Guess he's over that!  </p>
<p>After Susan and Amelia left for home, I put Riku in the stroller for a walk around Stow Lake. I thought he might nap for a bit, after all the exercise, fresh air, and eating every snack I had with me, but he found the lake, the ducks pecking away right beside the path, and the other birds swimming by just too intriguing to miss. I must take him there more often as he was so happy sitting watching them quack, eat,  and interact with each other. </p>
<p>It was dark by the time I bundled him into the car seat (5:30) and he snoozed on the half hour trip home. I had promised him time upstairs with the tent and the cars and so up we went, after making a cup of fresh orange juice and heating up some dinner for him. Riku sat on the bed exploring some wooden puzzle boxes while I fed him broccoli, carrot sticks, and polenta with tiny bits of "chicken" made from flavoured tofu. I was quite sure there wasn't going to be enough time for a bath for him, so instead asked him if he would like to play in the sink. We came downstairs and he went immediately to the plastics drawer, pulled out a cup and a container, and asked for a chair. That kept him busy and happy for almost a half hour while he stirred and poured to his heart's content. </p>
<p>It was a nice relaxing end to a relaxing day. Akane called just after 7 p.m. to say she was leaving the studio, so I dressed Riku and we set off to meet her. Riku was once again carrying his little shopping bag with cars, refusing to allow me to put in the three lemons he and his Dad had picked the day before. His new book on trucks couldn't go in either; Riku has his own sense of what is appropriate and allowed me to carry the bag after a few minutes, while he managed the book. </p>
<p>I was back home at 8 p.m. and tired from my early morning, and I suppose all that fresh air and exercise too! Kelly suggested that I make a bowl of oatmeal for my dinner... I was hungry but it was late, so I did just that, adding some raisins and cranberries to it, and ate sitting in the living room, finishing off one of my Oprah magazines... a very relaxing end to my day. Lights out at 11 p.m. after folding one more load of laundry and putting in another... </p>
