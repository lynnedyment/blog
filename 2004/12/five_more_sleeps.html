								<h2>Five More Sleeps</h2>
								<p>Today was a busy day in the house... no long walks, no fresh air... not good, but I really did need a full day in the house to finally get started at the cleaning/decorating, so that I can concentrate on wrapping and packing after this. I did well, and even took a couple of breaks for a hot cup of tea in one sitting!, and a leisurely chat with Candy and Gail on Skype to start off my morning. </p>
<p>At 5 p.m. I left the house to babysit Amelia while Susan and Kevin went out for dinner. I was greeted by Amelia's big welcoming smile; she had just finished off a big dinner and I sat with her while she had some fruit for dessert. Susan poured me a glass of wine and I helped myself to some spinach phyllo pastries, which really hit the spot. I was hungrier than I thought and they were so tasty. I ate the fruit bowl I took over after I tucked Amelia in. </p>
<p>Amelia was tired, so we sat and read three books, started another but  once I tried to put her to bed she had a hard time settling down. Amelia cried hard for about fifteen minutes while I tried walking her, stroking her back, whispering and singing to her... all the usual tricks, but she was having none of it. </p>
<p>We were both too warm after this first attempt, so we went off to the dark kitchen for a big drink of water and then sat in the darkened living room, with just the beautiful tree lights twinkly. Amelia was, as always, perfectly happy to try starting up a conversation about the lights and the baubles, but I told her it was sleepy time and she sat quietly leaning against my shoulder for about fifteen minutes. It took about ten minutes the second time around to get her into her crib and settled, although that little head bobbed up a couple of times when the floor boards squeaked when I was sneaking out! I stood at the door whispering "hush" for a few minutes and that did it. </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin came home at 9 p.m., earlier than I thought they would be, and bearing a wonderful tarte tatin with whipped cream for my dessert. I did wait until I got home to eat it, thinking it wouldn't hold well overnight... fruit is best eaten right away. </p>
<p>And now it's bedtime. I will finish finding places for Riku's large and growing collection of puzzles and books tomorrow morning, before he arrives for the day with me.</p>
