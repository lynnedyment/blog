								<h2>Potrero Hill to Japantown... and Back</h2>
								<p>What a very busy day it was again today! I had asked Susan to drop Amelia off early today, so I could get in a long nap plus some playtime with Amelia at home too. At 9 a.m. we headed off, with Amelia in need of a morning nap (a long restless night for her last night, said her mom), and I stopped to ask Akane if she would like to walk to Japantown with me, for her drop-in group with Riku. Akane thought that was a good idea too; we left at 9:35 and walking VERY briskly arrived at Sutter Street at 10:42. I'm not sure how far this is, but it's a long walk at this pace. Amelia slept for only forty minutes or so, and Riku napped as well for about a half hour. </p>
<p>Amelia stayed awake long enough to charm some of the senior citizens at the Japanese Community Centre, and then we shopped for a yogurt for her lunch... or at least tide her over until we got home for the big lunch packed by her mom. Lots of healthy snacks though had filled her tummy, so Riku ate the yogurt and Amelia ate a little of his squash and rice. It was lovely to have this little bit of time with Riku too. Akane said he had been pretty tired in the gorup today, despite the little nap beforehand. </p>
<p>Akane and Riku stayed downtown to do some shopping and since Amelia was showing signs of needing a longer nap, off we went to Potrero Hill. Amelia ate a great lunch, played keyboard, and stacked toys at the table. </p>
<p>Susan arrived just Amelia was finishing lunch, and so stayed around so we could have some exploring the house time. Off we went upstairs to sit in the tent for a bit, Amelia then explored the bathroom, and somehow snuck down the long set of stairs by herself! without our knowledge. We were both shuddering at how dangerous that could have been!.. but we came rushing down to find her at the keyboard of this computer, trying to bring up her favourite BabyType program. </p>
<p>Amelia said "Wow!" many times today, puckered up for at least a dozen kisses, and showed amazing dexterity at the stacking toy. She also showed me the sign for "ball" today and of course during our walks, never let a bird go by without letting me know by signing, in case I missed it. Such a clever girl! </p>
<p>I've answered a few emails, written a couple of extra Christmas cards, and started working on my birthday/anniversary cards for next year. I've now run out of steam though and am heading upstairs to get an early start tomorrow... I have the whole day on my own and hope to get many things crossed off that to-do list of mine! </p>
<p>The countdown continues... only six more sleeps!</p>
