								<h2><a href="/2004/12/one_week_today.html">One Week Today...</a></h2>
								<p>I will be in Ontario with Kelly, Gregg, and the children. Hard to imagine as there is still so much to do here before leaving! </p>
<p>Today started out early with a 5 a.m. awakening from Doug for a trip to the airport. He is off to bitterly cold Detroit; I crawled back into bed at 6 a.m. with two warm "bed buddies" and managed to doze off until 7:30. Good thing, as the day was busier than usual. </p>
<p>Riku had his second year check-up today at 9:30 a.m. I was afraid that Riku would fall asleep for his morning nap on our way there, but instead he managed to stay awake looking at all the sights from the car window. I had done a little role playing with him about what the doctor would do to him; he is older and I thought might remember going to the doctor and having a needle. He sure doesn't like to see that long table covered with paper; Bryn said tonight it was because it doesn't come equipped with pens!... and this might be as that is one of his favourite activities right now... drawing circles and "roads". </p>
<p>Riku too the appointment in stride, getting his heart and lungs listened to, his eyes shone with a bright light, a pokey instrument in his ears (he didn't like this much), his tummy probed, and his throat and mouth examined too. However, he knew enough to look suspiciously at the woman pulling on latex gloves and preparing something for him, so Akane got him nursing and the Hepatitis A shot didn't cause more than a flinch and a little crying out... and then, back to nursing. Works like a charm; this was one of Kelly's secrets for handling those early shots.</p>
<p>Stats are: head size-95th percentile, weight-15%, and length 50%... with a predicted height of 5'10.5". Shall see how this stands in sixteen years. Next check-up is in one year. Whew! No more needles.  </p>
<p>Riku and I came here after the appointment, for some play time with a big basket of newly discovered toys. After eating a late second breakfast of both hot cereal with berries, some scrambled egg and "bacon",it was time for a tuck in. He had napped for over two hours and was still a little dazed for a bit after waking. He perked up after lunch, played with his cars and trucks, and then we headed out for the playground at 4:30. </p>
<p>But first... big news! Riku said his first (I believe) seven word sentence today. We were looking at a book with a picture of a little boy waving goodbye to his mommy; he pointed and said "Buh bye, Mommy, see you later, okay?" Wow! </p>
<p>Riku spent 95% of his time climbing up the stairs on his own and down the little slide, but was in the sandbox for a bit with two other children sharing his sand toys. It is now dark at 5:15 and we packed up to pick up Akane for a trip to Costco. Luckily Bryn was home to help carry the bigger items up the stairs and he talked me into staying there for dinner, icicle hanging, and some "down" time. Riku and I played trains while Akane cooked up some pasta; we all sat down to dinner together and Riku, despite having eaten two tiny cookies, banana bread and "sluper food" (as he called his healthy drink the first time he had some today) managed to tuck away a nice little portion of filled pasta, an orange, and half a cracker. </p>
<p>Bryn did the dishes and Akane, Riku, and I hung icicles on the tree. Riku thought they should be shorter so tore them into bits, before stashing them close to the trunk. I guess at his level they were more easily visible there! I read a couple of stories to him, finishing off with "Goodnight Moon" before he kissed his daddy goodnight and asked his mommy to nurse. </p>
<p>The evening ended much later than I intended but with a game of "Spades", our first game in many many months. It was such a treat and I look forward to lots of cards over the holidays. The children in Toronto are game players too... </p>
<p>Sandy had her breast surgery today and Corey tells me that all went well, except for a mixup in one of the drugs they gave her, interfering with one she is already on! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/12/potrero_hill_to_japantown_and.html">Potrero Hill to Japantown... and Back</a></h2>
								<p>What a very busy day it was again today! I had asked Susan to drop Amelia off early today, so I could get in a long nap plus some playtime with Amelia at home too. At 9 a.m. we headed off, with Amelia in need of a morning nap (a long restless night for her last night, said her mom), and I stopped to ask Akane if she would like to walk to Japantown with me, for her drop-in group with Riku. Akane thought that was a good idea too; we left at 9:35 and walking VERY briskly arrived at Sutter Street at 10:42. I'm not sure how far this is, but it's a long walk at this pace. Amelia slept for only forty minutes or so, and Riku napped as well for about a half hour. </p>
<p>Amelia stayed awake long enough to charm some of the senior citizens at the Japanese Community Centre, and then we shopped for a yogurt for her lunch... or at least tide her over until we got home for the big lunch packed by her mom. Lots of healthy snacks though had filled her tummy, so Riku ate the yogurt and Amelia ate a little of his squash and rice. It was lovely to have this little bit of time with Riku too. Akane said he had been pretty tired in the gorup today, despite the little nap beforehand. </p>
<p>Akane and Riku stayed downtown to do some shopping and since Amelia was showing signs of needing a longer nap, off we went to Potrero Hill. Amelia ate a great lunch, played keyboard, and stacked toys at the table. </p>
<p>Susan arrived just Amelia was finishing lunch, and so stayed around so we could have some exploring the house time. Off we went upstairs to sit in the tent for a bit, Amelia then explored the bathroom, and somehow snuck down the long set of stairs by herself! without our knowledge. We were both shuddering at how dangerous that could have been!.. but we came rushing down to find her at the keyboard of this computer, trying to bring up her favourite BabyType program. </p>
<p>Amelia said "Wow!" many times today, puckered up for at least a dozen kisses, and showed amazing dexterity at the stacking toy. She also showed me the sign for "ball" today and of course during our walks, never let a bird go by without letting me know by signing, in case I missed it. Such a clever girl! </p>
<p>I've answered a few emails, written a couple of extra Christmas cards, and started working on my birthday/anniversary cards for next year. I've now run out of steam though and am heading upstairs to get an early start tomorrow... I have the whole day on my own and hope to get many things crossed off that to-do list of mine! </p>
<p>The countdown continues... only six more sleeps!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/12/five_more_sleeps.html">Five More Sleeps</a></h2>
								<p>Today was a busy day in the house... no long walks, no fresh air... not good, but I really did need a full day in the house to finally get started at the cleaning/decorating, so that I can concentrate on wrapping and packing after this. I did well, and even took a couple of breaks for a hot cup of tea in one sitting!, and a leisurely chat with Candy and Gail on Skype to start off my morning. </p>
<p>At 5 p.m. I left the house to babysit Amelia while Susan and Kevin went out for dinner. I was greeted by Amelia's big welcoming smile; she had just finished off a big dinner and I sat with her while she had some fruit for dessert. Susan poured me a glass of wine and I helped myself to some spinach phyllo pastries, which really hit the spot. I was hungrier than I thought and they were so tasty. I ate the fruit bowl I took over after I tucked Amelia in. </p>
<p>Amelia was tired, so we sat and read three books, started another but  once I tried to put her to bed she had a hard time settling down. Amelia cried hard for about fifteen minutes while I tried walking her, stroking her back, whispering and singing to her... all the usual tricks, but she was having none of it. </p>
<p>We were both too warm after this first attempt, so we went off to the dark kitchen for a big drink of water and then sat in the darkened living room, with just the beautiful tree lights twinkly. Amelia was, as always, perfectly happy to try starting up a conversation about the lights and the baubles, but I told her it was sleepy time and she sat quietly leaning against my shoulder for about fifteen minutes. It took about ten minutes the second time around to get her into her crib and settled, although that little head bobbed up a couple of times when the floor boards squeaked when I was sneaking out! I stood at the door whispering "hush" for a few minutes and that did it. </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin came home at 9 p.m., earlier than I thought they would be, and bearing a wonderful tarte tatin with whipped cream for my dessert. I did wait until I got home to eat it, thinking it wouldn't hold well overnight... fruit is best eaten right away. </p>
<p>And now it's bedtime. I will finish finding places for Riku's large and growing collection of puzzles and books tomorrow morning, before he arrives for the day with me.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/12/home_for_the_holidays.html">Home for the Holidays</a></h2>
								<p>Riku arrived on my doorstep at 9:45 this morning. I invited his parents upstairs for a minute before dashing off, to indulge in some freshly baked gingerbread cookies, made this morning and still warm. They went off with a couple of extras (Bryn took a couple for Brent too) and Riku enjoyed two of the little ones I had made for the two little ones in my life. </p>
<p>After waving goodbye to Akane and Bryn, Riku discovered the tiny wooden town set on the living room table (eight houses and a church), that had belonged to his Daddy. He quickly took them down, carrying them in two trips to the kitchen where he sat happily playing with them on the floor, while I finished off the cookies. Nap time after hot cereal and a thorough look through a British ABC book Doug had found for him ages ago; it seems to be a favourite right now and each time he looks at it he discovers something new. </p>
<p>After a forty minute nap Riku woke just in time for us to dash to the airport to pick up Doug. His flight was early, but thank goodness his bags were not, so he was patiently waiting for the bags when Riku ran up to him and grabbed his leg from behind. Riku gets so much attention as the minute someone smiles at Riku, he beams that 1000 watt smile right back at them, winning them over immediately. Riku's a charmer for sure! </p>
<p>Of course, we went on the free train that travels around the airport from the various terminals. We managed to get the front seat on the first part of the trip so that Riku has the best possible view. The last time we did this trip Riku pointed out the "tunnel" ahead of us, several times, and each time we told him that it wasn't a tunnel but a big roof. Today, as we came upon the first one of these he looked at me very seriously and said "roof... not a tunnel". We were astounded that he had not only retained that information but wanted to let us know about it too. Wow! as Amelia would say... this is one of her favourite words right now. </p>
<p>On the second part of our train ride, we had to share the big roomy platform with a man and his bag. Riku touched his bag and said "man's bag" and I said "yes, the man is going on a plane ride" to which Riku said "Canada." Of course the man heard him and turned to chat with me for a minute, asking if that was where we were going. Later on I told Riku he was going to Japan with his Mommy and Daddy; he processed that and then put it right back to me "Riku plane with Mommy, Daddy. Japan" nodding with certainty that this was correct. </p>
<p>On my walk home with Amelia the other day I had discovered a huge excavation site that I thought Riku would love to see. We stopped by there on our way home; Doug walked him over to see the huge flat lot of dirt with a digger, a pile driver (LOUD" Riku reported later to me) and a grader. It was like a Richard Scarry page come to life; perfect for this boy of ours. </p>
<p>We stopped at the grocery store for a few minutes; Riku and I stayed in the car. Today he had chosen to take a rat hand-puppet along to the airport with him, and while we waited Riku had the rat on his hand, facing towards the front window and saying to it in the sweetest voice "See??? ... cars." and then giving it a kiss. Then he turned it towards me, put it up to my face, and said "I'm hungry"... the first time I have heard this word from him. And he was obviously pretending for the rat too as he himself had just finished a container of yogurt while we waited for Doug. </p>
<p>Back home for lunch and then playtime with a new set of his Grandpa's old blocks, plus some that belonged to Auntie Kelly and Daddy too, not quite so old. I had organized his room yesterday so that three puzzles are at hand for him... his ABC puzzle, a rubber sorting peg set that used to belong to Bryn and Caillie, and a wooden set of puzzle pieces... heads, shirts, and pants that go together in various ways. Riku is very good at this and enjoys putting the sad face, or the worried face together with the various outfits. Fun to have these old toys being used by yet another set of children.</p>
<p>After a short afternoon nap I popped Riku into the tub for some water play, which he had asked for after lunch. He started off by getting out his favourite stick-on alphabet letters and stacking tub toys. Then Doug sat with him for ten minutes while I cleaned up the toys and he was very specific as to just what he wanted in his tub next. He asked Doug for a "bab", so in went the little doll from Caillie, and then he asked Doug for the "big baby" and Robin joined them. After playing with them a bit he told Doug to take them out. And by the time I joined them, the boat, that had gone in after the dolls, was also out. He used to just have the tub filled with things floating but not today... a new era. </p>
<p>Doug and I drove Riku home at 5:45, taking along a big bag of gingerbread cookies for the family, and then went off to "Home for the Holidays", a concert by the Gay Men's Chorus" of San Francisco. We used to attend this every Christmas Eve when we first moved here but of course when Brynnie was born started going to Toronto for Christmas. This year, for the first time, they held a concert the week before Christmas so we were able to attend. It's hard to explain what a wonderful evening this is, but the voices of the men are so beautiful, they sing both traditional carols and hymns, tonight threw in some Hanukkah and Kwanzaa music as well, and of course camped it up a bit for us too, making spirits light indeed! It always makes me a bit verklempt, as Mike Myers would say. </p>
<p>Four more sleeps...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/12/a_visit_with_santa_claus.html">A Visit with Santa Claus</a></h2>
								<p>I was up early this morning, and immedaitely got busy rolling out the second double batch of gingerbread men and making a rice pudding, to use up a full container of milk. I called to see if Riku could come over this morning, so that he could get a morning nap in before going to visit Santa at Stonestown Mall today. Daddy came up for a warm cookie before going to work.  </p>
<p>After breakfast, Riku had a great time playing with his cars in the kitchen, and then quietly going through his books alone in the living room, and whilst sitting on his red chair in the kitchen. At 11 a.m. Riku went down for an hour and a half nap! We picked Akane up and went off with a very excited little boy. He knew he was to visit Santa and we practiced his saying that he wanted  "big truck". </p>
<p>There was a line-up for Santa but Susan and Amelia showed up soon after we arrived, which was lots of fun. We all took turns walking around the tree area with the children, and soon it was time for the big moment. Amelia was a little apprehensive about this big guy in red waved exuberantly at her, and we hoped that Riku's enthusiasm would influence her. Riku walked right up to Santa, sat on his lap, touched his beard and pointed to his nose, and told him on cue that he wanted a big truck. Doug and Akane were taking photos with their digital cameras and managed to get some good ones of this duo. </p>
<p>Amelia was having none of it. Susan sat beside Santa with Amelia on her knee, but Amelia just wanted out of that scene! Poor wee girl; she  will no doubt be keen next year but this year was just too soon for her. She was so much happier walking around the mall, peeking at all the decorated trees and windows and delighting everyone with her polka dotted lime green dress; one woman exclaimed that she looked just like a Christmas decoration, and she did! </p>
<p>After the visit we wandered into a couple of stores and Riku once more took great delight in inspecting all there was to see. The toy store was such a treat for him; lots of things to look at in great detail... a robot that moved toward him, lots of wiggly little things, assorted balls of every colour, books, etc. We had a hard time convincing him it was time to leave there but it turned out he had lots of time in Macy's (while I stood in a very slow lineup to buy a little ornament for Amelia) inspecting all the ornament baskets once again. He had such fun doing this two weeks ago, and his enthusiasm hadn't dampened in the meantime. Doug told me later he was amazed at just how many words Riku knows now; he is also so careful about putting things back in exactly the right place after he has had a good look at them. </p>
<p>After dropping off Akane and Riku, Doug and I set out to do a few errands... extra gifts, some grocery shopping for Ontario... bread and chocolates, and finally decided to stop for an early dinner of pizza in Noe Valley. </p>
<p>I was very tired when we got home, but called Jody while enjoying a hot cup of tea. All is well with Jody and Hal; they will have their first paying B&B guest on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>I managed to get up enough energy to make up the sugar cookie dough before Doug and I finished off the day by watching a taped tv show. I enjoyed a little back rub while trying not to doze off! Only three more sleeps.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/12/one_week_from_today.html">One Week from Today...</a></h2>
								<p>is Christmas! Hard to believe! Another busy day but Kelly wrote to tell me yesterday that she has a massage booked for me, a birthday gift from her and Gregg, on Wednesday morning at 10 a.m. Ahhhh, I'll be more than ready for Ara... </p>
<p>Bryn had called last night to see if we would like to join him, Akane, Riku, Susan, Kevin, and Amelia for breakfast today at "The Pork Store", a very popular breakfast spot in the Haight district. I woke up at 7 a.m., hopped right into the shower, in order to be ready to leave at 8:10.. however, the phone rang, with a message from Bryn saying we were now meeting as close to 8 a.m. as possible, which meant leaving asap! Doug had a fast shower and off we went to pick up Bryn and family. </p>
<p>Breakfast was lots of fun; we had a big table at the front of the quiet restaurant when we walked in, but a half hour later it was full and noisy. The usual fare for the adults... eggs, toast, hash browns, tea for Akane and me, while Riku nibbled at my potatoes, toast, and some cereal and rice pudding that I had taken along with me. </p>
<p>After breakfast we snapped some photos of all of us and a kind woman offered to take a group shot too; Bryn walked Amelia for a bit while Kevin and Riku had a little stroll together. Riku took great delight in a very funny and huge pair of legs, made of... we're not sure...  sticking out of a window across the street from the restaurant. His grin and laughter were contagious and soon we were all seeing it through a two year old's eyes; it is a very funny thing to see! </p>
<p>Next on the list was a trip to Japantown, but alas, we had such an early start to our day that the stores weren't open yet. Rainbow, our local "health food" grocery store was open though with cheese and olive samples of which Riku and Grandpa are particularly fond!... so we strolled around there for a bit. Riku has so much fun wandering up and down the aisles, taking things off shelves, looking at them, and then putting them back exactly where he found them. </p>
<p>Back home alone, Doug did some computer work while I set about wrapping a few gifts, finishing off the birthday cards for January, and finally writing the last four Christmas cards which were waiting for addresses. Doug went out to buy fuel for the fondue pot, and I set the table, prepared the hot food, changed into a clean blouse, and was relaxed and ready at 3:30 when Akane, Riku, and Bryn walked in. Soon Susan, Kevin, and Amelia joined us, and an hour later Tay and Mike as well. Doug made the fondue, which was a big hit, Susan brewed up some delicious mulled wine, and we all relaxed, chatted, and enjoyed the afternoon. Amelia was quite taken with the fire going, but was amazingly good at realizing it was hot and staying away from it... while still being quite fascinated with it. Such a smart little girl she is! </p>
<p>Riku had a hard time sharing his Nana and toys with Amelia today, but this will get easier as they have more time together in the New Year. He had asked for a bath earlier and as soon as everyone had left I ran a deep tub for him and we had a half hour of time together in the steamy warm bathroom. Riku had quite the time in that tub tonight, splashing and kicking his feet, holding them under the faucet for ages, and giggling away. I think he was quite relieved to have me all to himself again! </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn tidied up for me while I was bathing Riku, and then we had a little time together before they left for home. They all sat at the table while Riku and his Dad drew... Riku asks for "color pencils" when he wants to draw; Bryn drew a Canadian flag, showed it to Riku, who promptly answered "Canada". </p>
<p>Riku also showed his daddy how he can cross his fingers (he learned this yesterday in the car on the way back from the visit to Santa) and adds that to his skill from last week of crossing his arms (and looking mighty proud while doing so), and interlacing his fingers, the skill from the week before. What fun all of this is to see!</p>
<p>Off to bed... just two more sleeps!  </p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/12/one_last_day_in_sf_for_this_ye.html">One Last Day in SF for this year... and on I go to Ontario!</a></h2>
								<p>Today was a busy day from the get-go, as someone says! I showered, checked my email, dressed, and got rolling... sugar cookies that is, and gingerbread men... a double batch of each. Doug came down and said that it sure smelled like Christmas and it does for sure. I took time out to read the paper and have my breakfast at one point but it was still almost noon by the time I finished the baking, cleaning up and packaging the cookies for delivery to Susan's and Kevin's, with two dozen tiny gingerbread ladies for Amelia (she's crazy about them!), and the rest to Hampshire Street, where I believe they are going to share the extras (if there are any) with Bryn's co-workers and some friends.</p>
<p>I phoned to talk to the children in Toronto and they sound as excited as I am feeling about my trip there; we plan to make some gingerbread on Tuesday morning and go to visit Santa that afternoon. Can't wait! </p>
<p>Doug finished wrapping the gifts while I did name tags and found some extra gifts tucked away upstairs. This job too seemed to take more time than I had thought it would but in between I was doing the wash, tidying up, organizing the front bedroom for a guest in January, etc. etc... so I'm sure I was more efficient than I was feeling! </p>
<p>I always dread the actual deciding what to pack although this actually went much faster than ever before. I felt comfortable enough to leave it so that we could deliver the gifts to Amelia and her parents before they tucked her into bed. We were there slightly under an hour, just time for a lovely glass of red wine in the living room, with the Christmas tree glowing and Amelia being her charming, wonderful self. She was quite content to have Doug carry her around for the longest time, and then danced for us, with Kevin, Susan and me joining in. Such a character is this little girl; it was hard to leave her as I know there will be big changes in the month that I'm away. </p>
<p>Off we went to visit Bryn and Riku; Akane was out for dinner and Doug and Bryn walked out to get quesadillas for us, Bryn's treat. However, they came home to discover the two meatless versions had chicken added to them, so off they went again. Riku and I, meanwhile, were having a splendid time. He chatted away to me while I fed him some dinner Akane had prepared for him... rice, eggs, and carrots... and then polished off some rice pudding I had taken over, and had a mandarin orange to finish off. Then it was time for "cars.. Nana play?" in the living room, where another tree glittered and twinkled away. It was a lovely time with Riku; he is so full of thoughts, does lots of talking... today all about robots and fires and hurting heads that he had seen on a video this morning on tv. </p>
<p>He was happy sitting and standing on the sofa while we ate, and then went off for some water play in the bathroom, making a big splash on the floor "uh oh!" and continuing on. I had him in his pyjamas and had brushed his teeth first so he was ready for bed. </p>
<p>I hoped to get photos of both families under the tree but it just didn't happen tonight. Amelia was tired and had "hat head" her mom said, they were all tired after a busy day, and Akane came in with friends with their young daughter, and Riku wanted to do nothing but play with her. </p>
<p>I said my goodbyes there and now I'm ready to go upstairs while Doug does the final packing job. I've transferred emails, folded the last load of clothes  and everything is ready for our departure for tomorrow morning at 6:15 a.m. Off I go to bed... as soon as Doug has packed us up... he's good at it though so it shouldn't be long.  </p>
<p>One more sleep!</p>
