								<h2>What a Grand Day!</h2>
								<p>I awoke at 6:45 this morning and had my emails read and a shower before the boys woke up, a little earlier than their intended 8 a.m. awaking but not by much. True to their promises last night they got right to cleaning their room, which really meant sorting it out, (putting all the Lego pieces in the right container etc.), and doing a really wonderful job on it. This took a grand total of twenty-five minutes of steady work and I promised to do the vacuuming and dusting. </p>
<p>At 9 a.m. we all sat down for breakfast together and then went out on the deck to try to recreate the photo of the four of them last summer, with Manitou, who was just a pup. Well, he was much more co-operative last year, as this year we could not pursuade him to lie down in front of them. Last year he sat on Bry's lap, and this year he could have stretched out on all four of them. </p>
<p>I "interviewed" Bryant, our second annual attempt at this. I think it will be fun for all of us to see these interviews years from now. Unfortunately, my camera battery needed charging so Bry' was the one and only one done today. </p>
<p>Myk' and Bryant left with their mom at 10 a.m. and at noon Bryn, Caillie, and I were at Ontario Place. It was a perfect day for it, with 24C temps and some cloud cover. And what a fun day it was; it was the most relaxing day of my visit as we just "hung" out there, doing whatever struck the children's fancy (which included talking me into a log ride! Yikes!). I survived, much to my surprise, but it wasn't my favourite part of the day. Knowing that a forty foot drop is coming after that long climb up does not make me relax and enjoy it one bit. </p>
<p>We ordered a large cheese pizza for lunch, and all had soft drinks with it (they came with the pizza, so what could I do but sit back and enjoy it). We found a table with a big umbrella and ate while the children planned what rides they would go on next. </p>
<p>They enjoyed the big climbing gym several times and then we went on to play miniature golf, which Caillie is <em>so</em> good at! She had two holes in one during the first game and another during our second game. </p>
<p>Both of them loved the "driving school," complete with lights, stop signs, and lines on the roads, which many children completely ignored. As a result, there were a few three car collisions at intersections... lots of fun to watch.</p>
<p>The maze was great fun too; the children went through the first time on their own and then wanted to show it all to me too. It was just terrific and very well done.  </p>
<p>Disappointingly, we had saved the water slides and events until after the first golf game, just to find that they closed the water park down at 4:30! Bryn had really been looking forward to it but reconciled himself to another game of golf, and a cup of ice cream before heading for the shuttle to Union Station. Another surprise was the early closing at 6 p.m. as we thought it would be fun to see an IMAX movie, free with our tickets. However... </p>
<p>Manitou was very happy to see us, so while Bryn practiced the piano, Caillie and I took him out to the alley to chase a ball for twenty minutes, along with his friend Jake. </p>
<p>None of us was hungry so we ate lightly... yogurt, some sourdough toast, and a pear, while we watched "Flubber" with Robin Williams. It gave me a chance to finish up the mending while sitting and relaxing at the end of the day with the children. Bedtime at 10 p.m. for two happy  and relaxed children... and 11:30 for their Nana. </p>
<p>P.S. Kelly called just as we were coming in the door... 100F and steaming hot on the sidewalks.</p>
