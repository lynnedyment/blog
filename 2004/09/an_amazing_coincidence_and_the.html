								<h2>An Amazing Co-Incidence and the Rest of My Day</h2>
								<p>Just after finishing a breakfast of perfectly poached eggs, sauteed Ontario tomatoes, and whole wheat Italian toast, here at Gerry and Lionel's this morning, the phone rang. It was a cousin of Lionel's from Mississauga calling to chat and to catch up on summer news. At one point Gerry handed the phone over to me, as she had told this gal that her cousin Lynne was visiting from San Francisco. Since she has a son in SF, she was curious as to where I lived. Sooo, we chatted a bit, her son lives on Delores Street, she occasionally visits so we arranged that the next time she was there she would give me a call and we could spend some time together. Her son works, and has no family there, so she spends her days wandering about on her own. I asked where her son works and was told at Sony downtown. Hmmm, interesting, I told her, as I knew two fellows his age who also worked at Sony and suggested she get a piece of paper and pen and write the names down as perhaps her son knew them. The first was Sean Coady and the second Brent Williams. Brent Williams she asked? Yes. Well, Brent was her son!!!!! </p>
<p>I'm telling you, we were all just astounded at this incredible co-incidence! Jackie Williams mother and Lionel's mother were sisters! She couldn't believe that Bryn Dyment was MY son as she has met him and been outside my house and on and on we went. I told her we had had a picnic together last Sunday and promised to send her photos via email, and I sent a second album too, in which Akane and Brent are in the kitchen cooking. Is this amazing???? </p>
<p>Following this astounding event, I drove over to Uncle Frank's and spent three and a half hours with him. We were both busy, he with photo related computer jobs while I did some sorting for him. </p>
<p>At 6 p.m. Gerry, Lionel, and I arrived at Marie and Graham's for a barbecue dinner... two types of macaroni salad, a really delicious potato salad, baked beans, pork chops for everyone else, and a very tasty spinach filled "cutlet" for me. </p>
<p>Graham brought out a big box of chocolate covered ice cream on a stick for part of our dessert, which really hit the spot. </p>
<p>It was a lovely night for sitting outside; the day had been hot and humid but the back yard was just perfectly comfortable until the mosquitos started to bite. In we went for a cup of tea and banana bread for those who wanted extra dessert, and then we headed for home, watched some t.v. while I soaked my feet in a foot bath and scrubbed away at my feet. Ahhh, very relaxing and now I should head off to bed.</p>
