								<h2>A Long Leisurely(but Humid!) Day...</h2>
								<p>It felt a little cooler this morning, so I made oatmeal for the children for breakfast. Myk' and Bry' weren't convinced they would like it, but with a sprinkle of cinnamon on it, they ate every bite of it. </p>
<p>Kelly and I headed out the door at 9:15 to walk with Camila, Manitou, and Jake, Manitou's neighbourhood friend. We were out for two hours and twenty minutes, strolling along the Don River, while the dogs romped about in the muddy water and along the dusty trails, enjoying their freedom. Next week I will take the camera along.</p>
<p>A fast walk to school to collect the children, a leisurely half hour on the patio while the children enjoyed their grilled cheese sandwiches and birthday cake lunch, and then I dashed off again to meet Tracy on the Danforth for a very tasty lunch, her treat!, at a Japanese restaurant. I had tempura vegetables and tempura tofu (sans bonito flakes), which were all delicious. Tracy surprised herself by eating a nice big tray of chicken and other assorted tidbits. We chatted, catching up on our lives, condensed into a short one and a half hours!, and then returned to our busy day. Tracy was on call but we lucked out and weren't interrupted. </p>
<p>The rest of the day and evening passed quickly... big snack outside for all of the children, after a short burst of rain earlier... piano practice for Bry' and Myk', then Myk' and Caillie did one of Caillie's birthday crafts... piano lessons for Bryn and Caillie, quite a few games of "Guess Who" with both Bryn and Caillie (Myk' and Bry' went off with their mom at 5:45 p.m.),and finally a late, light dinner of Gregg's homemade chicken soup and sourdough toast for the others, while I ate an egg and toast. </p>
<p>Bryn hurt his knee today during the school soccer try-outs today, and we are hoping it will be healed enough by tomorrow that he can try again tomorrow. </p>
<p>At bedtime, while Kelly read to Caillie, I read Bryn two chapters of a book about grizzlies I bought for his birthday last year; however, upon reaching the point where the farmer finds one of his bulls injured, takes his rifle and searches until he finds the mother grizzly and her four cubs, Bryn decided that was a very good point to stop. He wasn't going to risk hearing something sad before going to sleep. What a wise boy this is (I looked ahead!). I read a few pages from another book while he waited for his mom to come down and tuck him in. </p>
<p>Chatted with Carol on the phone, wrote some emails... and off I go to bed at 10 p.m.... or soon!</p>
