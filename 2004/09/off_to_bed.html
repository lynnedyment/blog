								<h2>Off to Bed...</h2>
								<p>after a lovely, but very busy day. That seems to be the only kind there are here, and in the Falls too! As a result the time is flying by faster than I ever imagined it would; Bryn called this afternoon and reminded me that I would be home a week today! Hard to imagine! So much still to do, so little time! </p>
<p>Today was again unseasonably hot at 29C. Vicki arrived just a few minutes after I walked the children to school, and went with me to the alley while Manitou had his fifteen minute "catch the ball" session. It was nice and cool in the basement so we went down there to chat while I did the ironing and got the last load of washing in. </p>
<p>Bryn and Caillie hadn't seen Vicki for quite a long time, possibly two years, but she looked familiar to them and gave her big hugs when we met them at school at 11:30. We all had grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch, and then drove the children to school... we were off to pick up Cath's gorgeous mixed breed dog from her grooming session, did some shopping at a hardware store and dropped the dog off at Cath's and Mike's home in the city. </p>
<p>All four children came home with me, and we quickly organized Bryn and Bryant for their 4 p.m. pickup to Jacob's birthday party. The girls spent an hour or so playing dress-up and came down looking very glamourous and willing to pose for a photo. We had dinner at home instead of going out for pizza, and watched a movie... "Annie" that was in the house. I think we were all too hot to think about walking out again. </p>
<p>The boys came home at 8 p.m., watched the end of the movie with us, and off they all went to bed, a tired group, at 9 p.m. First however, I lined them up on the side of the tub and washed eight very dirty feet.... actually, six, as Myk's were amazingly clean, thanks to runners and socks on her feet all day. Caillie definetely won the dirty feet award tonight but Bryant came in a close second. </p>
<p>Kelly and Gregg called to talk to the children; they just loved, loved, loved "O", the big show in Las Vegas, but were wondering if they were going to find enough to do for the next two full days, not being gamblers. Maybe one trip to Las Vegas will be enough for them. </p>
<p>10:40 and I'm off to bed. Bryant and Bryn have requested an 8 a.m. wake-up call to clean their room! I think Bry' is the one who is super keen but Brynnie will happily cooperate.</p>
