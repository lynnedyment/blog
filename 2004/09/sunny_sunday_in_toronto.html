								<h2>Sunny Sunday in Toronto</h2>
								<p>Everyone slept in much later than usual today due to our busy day yesterday. The house roused at 8:45 a.m. although ambitious Kelly had awakened at 6 a.m. and gone off to the gym! I was very impressed. </p>
<p>It was a bit of a rush getting out of the house for 10:30 for Bryn's soccer game but we made it, and had time to pack snacks and sandwiches too. What a treat it was to see Brad Gerster there as well; Rebecca had a game scheduled following ours and Jane and Becca came over for a visit with us all. It was lovely catching up on their news and Jane's trip to Victoria this summer. Tracy and Becca eventually joined us too. </p>
<p>Bryn's team unfortunately lost by one point, but the team was happy to have gotten so far along this term. We packed up and went to the other field to watch Becca's team play half their game, and then left for home. Gregg and Kelly surprised us all by pulling into a Dairy Queen for "blizzards". We sat outside at a table with a view of the hills and relaxed before heading home. </p>
<p>We played some games... Myk' and I played two games of Chinese Checkers, Caillie and I played Hi-Ho CherryO, and so the afternoon passed. The children had piano practice, and Manitou needed some outside playtime, while Gregg prepared chicken, corn, and portobello mushrooms on the barbecue and a big Caesar salad for dinner. </p>
<p>Caillie was in bed by 8 p.m. and the others followed shortly after. It was very, very humid tonight, and Kelly eventually turned on the air-conditioner, which improved my life immmensely! They have had a cool and rainy summer here, and all the good weather and high humidity waited for my visit. I was quite looking forward to Fall in Ontario but there are very few leaves changing colour so far. </p>
<p>Bed at 10:30 tonight; got lots of reading done... finished my book and went searching through the shelves for one of Kelly's.</p>
