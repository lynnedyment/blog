								<h2>Friday Outings with Amelia and Riku</h2>
								<p>Susan brought a sleepy little girl over at 9:30 this morning. Amelia was going to visit with us while her mommy went to the dentist; we hoped to just pop her in the stroller and I was prepared to walk with her, continuing the nap. However, Amelia had other plans, so in we came for forty minutes of exploring the kitchen and Riku's room. </p>
<p>Doug and I had eye appointments in the Mission so our plan now was to walk her up and then take turns walking a sleeping Amelia. Once again, however, Amelia had other plans! Instead of sleeping, she decided to explore the waiting room thoroughly, walking around her stroller patiently, over and over, exploring the round stools that squeaked when she turned them, and cruising from one chair to another. She burned a lot of calories in this hour and a half, so I fed her some yogurt, peaches, and snacks to keep her going. </p>
<p>After everyone in the office had paid lots of attention to her, we left for home. Of course she fell asleep just fifteen minutes before we arrived, so Susan and I walked her through the Mission District for the second time. A smiling little girl awoke after a one-hour nap, came back here to polish off an entire bottle of carrots, and finished the rest of the yogurt! </p>
<p>I called Akane almost immediately after Susan and Amelia left, and learned that Riku had just fallen asleep in his stroller, after a bus/lunch outing with her. I hated the thought of his being wakened after a too short nap, so off I dashed for another walk in the Mission! It was a very hot, hot, day here, and I managed to walk on the shady side of the streets for another hour's walk. </p>
<p>Doug came over to pick us all up for a Costco/Safeway run. Riku usually runs around being very energetic in the stores but he was happy to have either his Grandpa or his Nana carry him around today. It was too hot for him, too, I would guess. </p>
<p>This was a busy and fun day with the children... next week at this time I will be in Niagara Falls, very far away from them both.</p>
