								<h2><a href="/2004/08/wednesday_in_toronto.html">Wednesday in Toronto</a></h2>
								<p>Busy morning unpacking and settling in for five days. Nice to have some order to the two huge bags I brought with me; I don't enjoy living out of a suitcase. The gifts are all downstairs waiting to be wrapped for birthdays and Christmas. </p>
<p>Kelly left the house at 11:20 to pick up Bryn, Myk', Bry', and Caillie from school, while I prepared grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch (although I had a bowl of Kelly's delicious homemade corn chowder instead). We walked back to school with them all after lunch and Caillie showed me how well she shimmies up poles! Wow! I was very impressed.</p>
<p>I managed to get lots of emails done in the afternoon, after I finished up the last of the laundry and some of the ironing. Off Kelly and I went at 3:20 to pick up the children; Caillie and I raced a couple of times a block (she won!); Sean and Aillie were with us too so Kelly and I made up a big fruit plate, a big bowl of pistachio nuts, some trail mix, and watched as it all disappeared. Music was turned on for entertainment and since it was much too loud for my ears, I disappeared downstairs with a hot cup of tea and finished up the ironing. </p>
<p>Bryn had soccer practice so he and Caillie had pesto for dinner, with chicken on the side, and broccoli. Both of the children must be having growth spurts as I am amazed at how much they eat these days. </p>
<p>At bedtime, I read to Caillie and she read to me; this is always the favourite part of my day with the children and after Kelly had tucked Caillie in, Bryn read to me... he was so tired after his soccer practice, and then I read a book to him, one of our old favourites... a British children series about Postman Pat. It's a little young for him, and he knows it, but still enjoys it.</p>
<p>Later that evening I finally managed to read an email from Wayne about more Rodgers family information. It was amazing and as I traced down the generations I was astounded to not learn only my great-great-grandmother's maiden name, but to see that Norman Jewison is in the family tree! I haven't traced it back yet to see the connection but it is something obscure I'm sure... his great-great grandmother and mine were sisters or somesuch but what fun this was to see! </p>
<p>Disturbing email from Becky in the later part of the evening stating that Gail is in the hospital with a pancreatic attack; it has been years since this has been a problem. I called Candy and we compared notes but both had the same information. Hope to hear from Gail tomorrow as she expects to be out of the hospital. </p>
<p>Bedtime at 11:10 for me; snuggled in with Caillie. Wind blowing madly from the tail end of a hurricane.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/back_to_my_thursday_with_riku.html">Back to my "Thursday with Riku" Day</a></h2>
								<p>I PalTalked with all three of my sisters today. Candy is preparing for her trip with Rick to B.C., Gail is anticipating their arrival, and Beth filled me in on Skype, a free Internet telephone service, which she, Don, Glenn, and Candy (and now we) have all installed on their computers. </p>
<p>Riku arrived a little later than usual, and I was very happy to see that little face coming up the outside stairs to visit with us. I gave Riku a soft cuddly beige dog, which he instantly added to his current collection of favourite animals on his bed... a monkey, Brynnie's black and white dog, a white mouse and a smaller baby mouse, and the large squirrel that he adopted the week before I left for Boston. It makes me laugh to see him try to crowd them all into his arms to nap with him. </p>
<p>Doug and I took him off to Mission Delores Park. Brynnie and Caillie were very fond of the slides at this park; Riku was quite taken with the large sandbox area and several interesting pails and toys that a little boy was playing with. Riku wasn't too sure about a little fellow playing with his big truck, but soon realized the swap was in his favour. </p>
<p>Doug took him to this park when I was away and told me that Riku wasn't keen on the swings, but today he was delighted with his ride, although kept it fairly short. Back to the house for a wee nap after playing with his trucks and cars.</p>
<p>Our day was cut a bit short with him, as we left at 5 p.m. to attend a musical event in Danville with a couple from Doug's PEA group. We listened to bluegrass music outside a very busy outdoor plaza, where several other groups were playing as well... "Hot Nights in August". I am still feeling jet lagged, so up to bed at 10:30 p.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/good_morning_amelia_good_night.html">Good morning, Amelia; good night, Riku.</a></h2>
								<p>It has been almost two weeks since I have seen Amelia; Susan told me on the phone yesterday that she had learned to clap, and clap she did today... many many times. Amelia clapped when she reached out to touch my hand, she clapped when a woman stopped to admire her and tell her what a sweetheart she was, and she clapped when she slid off Riku's bed all by herself. </p>
<p>This morning we had a lovely three-hour walk in Noe Valley and through the Mission District; I stopped by the Magdalene grotto at the SF General Hospital for the last half hour of her one-and-a-half-hour nap. Waking up smiling at the trees blowing in the wind, Amelia clapped when I smiled at her and then demonstrated her new skills to Doug at home during lunch. What a treat to see this smiling happy little girl again! </p>
<p>Bryn called after dinner to see if we would like to join him and Riku at the playground. We all walked over together and Riku was happy to roam around from the sandbox to the round-about (his first time on it alone, as the park was fairly quiet at this hour), up in the playhouse, and then a run around the green area. He has learned about chimneys so we looked for them on the way home, a scant commodity in SF. We stayed for tea, which meant that Riku had Grandpa read stories to him, as well as his Nana. Pajama time and then teeth brushing time, one more story, and we left a sleepy boy ready for his bed. It's good to be home.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/a_surprise_saturday_morning_vi.html">A Surprise Saturday Morning Visit</a></h2>
								<p>The door bell rang this morning and I went down to find a darling little face beaming up at me. Riku was bundled up in his navy coat, jaunty scarf, and a summer hat, ready for whatever weather came his way. Akane is not feeling well: she has the sore throat and cold that seems to be going around, so was home having a rest while Bryn and Riku hung out with us for a bit. </p>
<p>Some highlights of our time together... </p>
<p>... Riku loves playing with water in the sink, or anywhere, so the new plastic boat went into the kitchen sink and was filled and refilled with many pitchers and cups of water.</p>
<p>... Riku pointed out the letter N to me from the NO sign Doug put up in the kitchen while I was away. He now recognizes R I K U N O K B and somehow H... which none of us has taught him!</p>
<p>... we spent a good hour in the back yard, Riku busy filling up the big crock of water, placed there for the birds, with as many rocks as he can carry. His big truck was filled with twigs and leaves by the end of my gardening session out there. One of Riku's big pleasures these days is the ability to just wander in and out of the house and garden at will. </p>
<p>... After he "suggested" that his Dad go down to the kitchen, Riku and I enjoyed some time on the bed upstairs, reading the familiar "upstairs" books and sorting through the pearl beads in a tiny box. </p>
<p>... After his nap, Riku got his Nana and Grandpa up dancing in the kitchen. We are quite the sight! Riku loves it and makes sure we are all taking part in the wild and wooly dance.</p>
<p>How lucky we are to have this little boy just a quick seven minute walk away from us.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/a_perfect_sunday.html">A Perfect Sunday</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn suggested on Saturday that we all head off for some beach time today; I am always up for this, so off we went, sans Akane, who is still under the weather with her cold. </p>
<p>It's hard to describe how thrilled Riku was with this outing... he took one look at the rolling waves and was on his way out to meet them! Bryn quickly rolled Riku's jeans up past his knees, we did the same with our slacks, and all headed for the water. Riku showed no hesitation at all... no matter how cold the water was, no matter how strong the pull of the water on the sand was on our feet when the water rolled back, and even when a rogue wave completely soaked Riku it didn't faze him a bit... blink, blink, and back to it all! </p>
<p>Once we were thoroughly wet we headed back for the biggest and best sandbox of them all... Riku happily sat in the warm sand finding one treasure after another, feathers from the hundreds of birds swirling above us, seaweeds and kelp, shells, and hermit crab legs... so much to keep him busy and interested.</p>
<p>We've decided this is far too much fun to do so infrequently, so we'll be heading back out there soon.</p>
<p>Doug and I drove to Petaluma in late afternoon to see Iris Dement sing in a local hall there; she was just terrific and I was so glad we decided to go. All that fresh air and exercise at the beach and the late evening out made for a very good night's sleep!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/riku_time_1.html">Riku Time</a></h2>
								<p>It's Tuesday, so we had our regular all-day date with Riku. Bryn dropped him off in just enough time for a forty-minute nap, and then Riku, Doug, and I went off with Akane for a visit to his doctor. He flirted with a woman in the sitting room and hesitated going into the office, choosing instead to flirt with her from a distance. It was very funny to watch! </p>
<p>After the visit, Riku and I spent some time together in the children's section of a bookstore in Laurel Village. Riku is so happy perusing the shelves, and was quite taken with a sticker book filled with pictures of tractors, ambulances, fire engines, big trucks, diggers, etc. but he looked through and at many other books too. </p>
<p>A twenty-minute visit to the toy section of Woolworth's was a big hit; there were several children around his age choosing small toys and demonstrating them, and Riku was very interested in being part of all the action. We bought some bubble liquid and alphabet letters for the tub. </p>
<p>It was lunch time so we all went off for a rare lunch out together to a Mexican taqueria on 24th Street. Riku is very fond of tortilla chips and daintily nibbles his way through the biggest one he can find in the bowl. </p>
<p>He was more than ready for a long nap once we arrived back home; it was a busy morning. Riku spent most of the rest of his day here outside helping me to water all the plants, one by one, with a small measuring cup and a lot of patience! He was thrilled with the big tub of water at his disposal, and after watching me water the garden with the hose, he knew just what to do. </p>
<p>I carried him home at 6 p.m. and he carefully carried home the four letters we had picked out of the alphabet package... R I K and U; he wasn't about to let go of them once we found them, so they will come back here another day, for bathtimes. </p>
<p>Doug and I went to an author's reading tonight at "M is for Mystery", a local fellow from Menlo Park, Barry Eisler; he was very interesting and entertaining and now I want to read the first of his very-well-reviewed three books.</p>
<p><a href="/i/600/20040817100201.jpg"><img alt="Riku at Books, Inc." height="150" width="200" src="/i/200/20040817100201.jpg"></a></p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/deja_vu.html">Deja Vu</a></h2>
								<p>I spent the loveliest of days with Amelia today, as she spent much longer playing in the house than ever before. She had napped in the car on the way over so, when Susan left her here, Amelia was ready to move... and move she did. </p>
<p>It was like having Riku here at the same stage, crawling faster than one would imagine possible, hanging on to my leg as I made fruit salad, and walking along a long hallway, side-stepping the entire length of it, just the way her daddy described this new activity to me. Amelia also decided to turn around to slide down on her own today... but from the top of the steps... I was videotaping her and so there is a fast ending to that movie! </p>
<p>I also opened up a big bottom drawer in the kitchen and Amelia discovered as well just how much fun it is to drop cookie cutters all over the floor. Riku still likes to get into this drawer, so this stage will last a little longer yet. The smaller drawer beside it holds plastics (containers, lids, cups, etc.) and is an everlasting source of pleasure. </p>
<p>We left the house at 3 p.m. to meet Akane and Riku for what I hoped would be her long afternoon nap but no such luck; the Mission District is just too busy and interesting for sleeping, so Amelia waited for a quieter street and napped for a half hour only.  </p>
<p>At one point she and Riku reached out hands to each other; he smiled and patted her. I hope that one day they will be good buddies.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/a_trip_to_the_valley.html">A Trip to "The Valley"</a></h2>
								<p>Doug wanted to give blood today at the Stanford University Blood Donor Clinic (they do lots of transplants there and are always in need of donations, especially his blood type), so after a quick morning nap for Riku, off we went. Riku extended his nap by snoozing a little towards the end of the trip, although spent a lot of time at the beginning of the trip naming things outside the car windows... trucks, cars, motorcycles (he has a way to say this that none of us can remember or repeat), and bridges, especially bridges, get lots of attention. Bryn and I spent some time during our car trip on Sunday "ducking" under the bridges, much to Riku's delight. </p>
<p>Riku and I decided to poke around the lovely outdoor mall in Palo Alto while Doug was at the clinic. We have done this before and Riku always enjoys the freedom to just wander in and out of stores (sometimes empty but there are always mirrors around to keep him entertained), stop to look at the flowers (really, he always does), slowing down long enough to say "Hi!" to various people, admire the fountains, and just have fun meandering under his own steam. </p>
<p>Back home at 6 p.m. Riku made it clear that he wanted to go upstairs to hang out for a bit. He sat on the bed playing with the loose pearls in a tiny glass box, something he does at least once a week. I pulled out a new-to-him jewellery box filled with necklaces of various shapes and colours, which kept him busy for another half hour, and then he had some time left over for reading and playing with his big container of plastic blocks from his Auntie Kelly. </p>
<p>Off he went with his Daddy at 7:15, tired but happy, after a busy and successful day away from the city.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/strolling_with_amelia.html">Strolling with Amelia</a></h2>
								<p>Well, everyone should be so lucky as to be greeted with the big beaming smile that awaited me today! Amelia was very happy to see me and showed me how much in the most delightful way possible. Her whole face lit up, she reached out for me, put those chubby little arms around me and buried her head in my neck. Nothing could be sweeter! </p>
<p>Amelia was ready for a nap, as she and Mommy had been out for a long walk and time in the sandbox earlier in the afternoon. After struggling to get her sunhat off (I was sure she wouldn't succeed as it was under her head... but what do I know?) Amelia gave in and slept for almost two hours. </p>
<p>She awakened slowly, giving me a sweet smile, closing her eyes again for a few minutes and then coming around with an even bigger smile. </p>
<p>I really love my walk out to Stow Lake, and today was a perfect day for it; the sun wasn't shining, so it wasn't too warm, but instead the ideal temperature for strolling through the rose garden, on the way out to the lake and on the way back.</p>
<p><a href="/i/600/20040820153925.jpg"><img alt="Can the smile get any bigger?" height="150" width="200" src="/i/200/20040820153925.jpg"></a></p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/two_visits_today.html">Two Visits Today</a></h2>
								<p>Riku dropped by this morning with his mom and dad, just long enough to get out of his light pants and shirt and into a Hawaiian cabana set. He looked adorable and was very happy to be outside with his tummy bare and even happier that the hose was available for his use! How Riku loves the back yard. They were here for only forty minutes or so and Riku was outside all that time (except for a short dance break), before heading off to run errands. </p>
<p>Later on, I invited them over for dinner, since I had made a huge portion of mushroom stroganoff. Some went over to Susan and Kevin for their dinner and after Riku had a little more time outside playing, we polished off the rest of it here. We even had a few minutes to smile at Amelia when she showed up with her dad for the pick-up. </p>
<p>Two nights ago I put together a little photo book for Riku with pictures of some of his family members and friends. Doug did the printing in it and today we had it laminated; Riku was delighted with it, and as I said goodbye to him at the car, he was busy pointing out his very good friend Lara to me.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/picnic_at_baker_beach.html">Picnic at Baker Beach</a></h2>
								<p>Susan, Kevin, Amelia, Brent, Akane, Bryn, Riku, Doug and I all met up at Baker Beach today at 4 p.m for a picnic. This beach is just down the street from Robin Williams' massive pink house, overlooking the water and the bridge, so that was an added plus to the trip... always fun to see where the local celebrities live. </p>
<p>It was slightly overcast but the sun did shine through a bit eventually. Overcast is fine with most of the folks in our group though, so there were no complaints. Our "late lunch" was a little later than we originally planned, so we put the food out immediately and dug in.... potato salad, tabouli, Greek salad, three Acme baguettes, two different cheeses, some vegie "cold cuts, chips and Cokes, a thermos of hot tea, and homemade brownies, fresh strawberries, and grapes for dessert. </p>
<p>It was a busy and fun filled time. I walked Riku up and down the little hill a couple of times, coaxed him eating a little lunch (he really would rather play in the sand), and walked Amelia to the far end of the beach. She pays lots of attention to everything she sees... the dogs running and chasing after balls, people in the water, the bridal couple posing for photographs, and of course the waves and the birds too. </p>
<p>Bryn, Kevin, and Brent formed a triangle, passing a football back and forth to each other. Brent tackled the ball seriously enough that he dove into the sand after it, but was too fast to get a photo of him. Darn! It was impressive too! </p>
<p>Doug had some time to read, Brent filled us in on his life (he might be moving to San Diego, after delaying for several months), and at 6:30 p.m. we bundled everything up and headed home... 'twas a lovely day, it was!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/egrets_turtles_blackberries_an.html">Egrets, Turtles, Blackberries, and... Amelia!</a></h2>
								<p>Doug and I walked a sleepy little girl through Golden Gate Park today. It was a lovely late afternoon walk, not too hot and not too cool, but just right! Amelia fell asleep just seven minutes after heading down the Panhandle, and slept past the rose garden, missed the snowy white egret, and didn't get to eat even one wild blackberry from the big patch behind Stow Lake. The big juicy ones are getting harder to find but Doug took a coat hanger with him today to pull down some of the less reachable and fuller branches. Yum! Susan guessed, from the blackberry juice on my cheek, what we had been up to. A day or two more of hot sunny days will ripen up lots more, so I'm hoping for one more fill of them before heading off to Ontario next week. </p>
<p>Oh yes, we saw our first turtle today in the pond, and then spotted three more... very exciting! The snowy egret was just beautiful and stuck around long enough for Doug to take a few photos of him.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/garden_boy.html">Garden Boy</a></h2>
								<p>Riku used to head for his tin box of cars and trucks when he first came up the stairs each morning, but lately he has been walking right to the kitchen door and asking "Outside? Garden?" instead. It was a little cool when he first arrived and I managed to interest him in the button box until it warmed up a bit out there. I wanted to sweep the garden, and it's more pleasant when the sun is shining. </p>
<p>Riku ate a <strong>big </strong>breakfast, his second of the day, and played with the button box for the second time. He likes to pour all the buttons on the kitchen rug, right under my feet at the sink, and then exclaim over all of them... "<strong>Big</strong> bubbie!", "<strong>Two</strong> bubbies!" (if they are the same), "little bubbie" and so on. Whenever he finds one with the thread still attached, he hands it to me with a big "oh, oh" and waits until I cut it off and hand it back to him. No dillydallying allowed. </p>
<p>After his morning nap out we went outside, me to sweep up the long and prickly branches of needles from the California redwood tree, and Riku to insist that I <strong>not</strong> put them in the recycling bin. He really wanted to fill his dump truck and/or my flower pots with them instead. Eventually we made some headway and once Riku was allowed to use the hose, that was it... I could do whatever I liked with the branches!  </p>
<p>Today Riku spent about a half hour upstairs on his own... most unusual, as he almost always wants company up there. I snuck up a couple of times and he was busy playing with the big container of plastic blocks from his Auntie Kelly, quietly talking to himself. </p>
<p>Later in the day, we walked Doug to the BART station at 24th and Mission, and then stopped off at the playground on 23rd Street, Riku's "local", so to speak! Usually he plays in the sandbox but today the small room inside the building, where they offer sing songs etc. throughout the week, was open. Riku painted with blues and purples, made circles and lovely long swaths of colour, and climbed in and out of a nylon "house" with three "rooms". There were many other children there and Riku really loves the company of others. One little girl gave him a <strong>big</strong> hug which he happily accepted. </p>
<p>Back to the house for a long splashy bath, a lovely way for him to end his day here, and then a walk over to meet his mommy, who had been at the studio most of the day. I walked with them back to the house and left Riku ready to nurse, a happy boy indeed!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/two_wee_ones_today.html">Two Wee Ones Today</a></h2>
								<p>I phoned Susan this morning to see if Amelia could come by for a play date. I was lucky... her mom had some errands to run, Amelia needed someone to play with, and I needed a little one to walk with. We seem to have a very nice little symbiotic relationship going here. </p>
<p>Amelia is much more mobile now and it's fun to watch her scoot around from room to room, disovering new things in each one. Today she pulled a few bears off the settle in Riku's room, played a little keyboard and percussion in the kitchen, wandered into the living room to glance at a few books on the coffee table, and scattered the various chickens from place to place. </p>
<p>Big events today... Amelia managed to get up two steps on her own; the bottom one which is much deeper than most, so I was very impressed! She also turned herself around to slide down off Riku's bed, another first for her here. Susan did tell me that she managed to get both up and down off the low coffee table in their living room, so she had been practicing! </p>
<p>She and Doug sat and had lunch together and what an appetite she has! Amelia ate a whole serving of carrots with nori crumbled into it, a small container of mango bites, a good sized portion of my homemade applesauce, and some toddler "circle" and "teddy bear" snacks to top it off. </p>
<p>All three of us went for a walk in the Mission District and Amelia managed to stay awake for about a half hour on this gorgeous sunny day. She awoke just in time for her Mom's arrival at 3:30. </p>
<p>At 6 p.m. Akane, Bryn, Riku, Doug, and I went off to San Mateo for some grocery shopping, followed by dinner at a Sichuan restaurant, new to Doug and me. Riku and I explored while the others went to the grocery store, and we discovered a great fountain. Riku spent at least ten minutes admiring it and dipping his hand under the spout. What little things bring this boy joy! </p>
<p>After dinner, while his parents sat at an outdoor cafe for a bit, he entertained Doug and me by marching along the sidewalk, greeting everyone who passed him with a big "Hi!", waving his arms about, playing on the keyboard at the bank ATM for quite a long time, stomping on the grates around the trees (laughing when we did the same), and just generally enjoying every moment of time, as only Riku can! </p>
<p>A sleepy boy fell asleep on the way home...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/a_shopping_expedition_with_ame.html">A Shopping Expedition with Amelia and Riku</a></h2>
								<p>Susan and Amelia drove to Vacaville this morning to meet up with Doug, Riku, and me for a little shopping at the outlet mall. Both children napped on the way there, and both were still sleeping when we arrived. Once they were awake (within fifteen minutes of pulling in), they were both ready to explore these new surroundings. Susan stocked up on some great bargains for Amelia for the next few months and I shopped for Caillie's birthday. </p>
<p>Along the way I found a few fun gifts for Riku's birthday in November and he chose a book in the bookstore. He picked it off the shelf, insisted we sit and read it immediately and was not willing to put it down for one minute. He gave it to Grandpa to buy and then held it all the way home. It's a small activity book about firemen, a big fire truck, and a dog, with a wheel to turn, a fireman to drop down the pole, a hill for the fire truck to descend, and a couple of flaps with surprises underneath. </p>
<p>Amelia and Riku thoroughly enjoyed the activity table at Carter's and played there with several other children while Susan found a few more irresistable outfits for Amelia. </p>
<p>Off to <em>Fresh Choice</em> for lunch; Amelia sampled lots of different foods and was happy to sit in a high chair next to Riku and experiment with the choices offered her. Riku ate a varied meal as well, but finished off with a bowl of tapioca pudding, just like Grandpa. The children both napped again after lunch; I think the heat just knocked them out. The adults managed to deke in and out of a few more stores before heading for the city, before the big rush hour hit. </p>
<p>It was very <strong>hot</strong> and I had promised Riku time in the garden when we got home. I was happy to be out there with him, as it is a lot cooler here than it was in Vacaville! Riku is no longer content to just pour water from the containers to the garden; after getting his hands on that hose on the weekend he knows how to water much more efficiently. Does he love watching that spray hit everything in sight! He managed to wash a bit of the kitchen floor with just one swirl in the right direction. Riku cooled off just fine with his shorts and t-shirt soaked right through. However, the big smile on his face was worth the puddles and mud he created in a few well watered areas. </p>
<p>We finished off our day together with his favourite "splashy bath". Before washing Riku's hair tonight, we "washed" Robin's hair; he is the boy doll which I bought for Kelly when I was expecting Bryn. </p>
<p>After Grandpa showed Riku some kaleidescopes on the computer for five minutes, I walked him home, stopping along the way to admire a cat who was rolling on the sidewalk and purring. Riku was thrilled to bits to see a cat up so close and a few minutes later I passed him on to his mommy. In all, a lovely day with both of the children in my SF life!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/friday_outings_with_amelia_and.html">Friday Outings with Amelia and Riku</a></h2>
								<p>Susan brought a sleepy little girl over at 9:30 this morning. Amelia was going to visit with us while her mommy went to the dentist; we hoped to just pop her in the stroller and I was prepared to walk with her, continuing the nap. However, Amelia had other plans, so in we came for forty minutes of exploring the kitchen and Riku's room. </p>
<p>Doug and I had eye appointments in the Mission so our plan now was to walk her up and then take turns walking a sleeping Amelia. Once again, however, Amelia had other plans! Instead of sleeping, she decided to explore the waiting room thoroughly, walking around her stroller patiently, over and over, exploring the round stools that squeaked when she turned them, and cruising from one chair to another. She burned a lot of calories in this hour and a half, so I fed her some yogurt, peaches, and snacks to keep her going. </p>
<p>After everyone in the office had paid lots of attention to her, we left for home. Of course she fell asleep just fifteen minutes before we arrived, so Susan and I walked her through the Mission District for the second time. A smiling little girl awoke after a one-hour nap, came back here to polish off an entire bottle of carrots, and finished the rest of the yogurt! </p>
<p>I called Akane almost immediately after Susan and Amelia left, and learned that Riku had just fallen asleep in his stroller, after a bus/lunch outing with her. I hated the thought of his being wakened after a too short nap, so off I dashed for another walk in the Mission! It was a very hot, hot, day here, and I managed to walk on the shady side of the streets for another hour's walk. </p>
<p>Doug came over to pick us all up for a Costco/Safeway run. Riku usually runs around being very energetic in the stores but he was happy to have either his Grandpa or his Nana carry him around today. It was too hot for him, too, I would guess. </p>
<p>This was a busy and fun day with the children... next week at this time I will be in Niagara Falls, very far away from them both.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/summer_day_in_the_city.html">Summer Day in the City</a></h2>
								<p>It was 90F (about 33C) here in San Francisco yesterday, and not much cooler today. Doug and I walked Amelia from 11 a.m. until 1:30 p.m. in Golden Gate Park, and Amelia slept for all but twenty minutes of this walk. Susan and Kevin finally managed to see "The Weeping Camel"; I didn't want them to miss it.<br />
 <br />
It was lovely and cool under the big redwoods, especially along the pathways around Stow Lake. Today we once again saw the egret, but along with it, we saw a log lined with turtles basking in the sun... what a treat! There were some ripened blackberries, thanks to the high temps the last couple of days, so we stopped for about twenty minutes to get our fill of them. When it was time to meet up with Susan and Kevin, Amelia was still sleeping and so Susan walked her for another hour and five minutes, a record nap for Amelia!</p>
<p>Before Doug and I went to see the film "Hero" in the afternoon, we needed to stop for a bite to eat. Doug checked his list of "restaurants we should try sometime" and came up with a winner... "Reggae Runnins", conveniently located just a few blocks from Susan and Kevin's. It is run by Sister Sarah and Ras Wadadah and the food was as excellent as their names are interesting. We shared a big bowl of the daily special, barbecued tofu, with green salad, brown rice, and a most delicious sambosa, a lentil and veggie filled pastry. We will be going back there to try another of their all-vegetarian menu. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/a_wee_visit_with_riku_and_akan.html">A Wee Visit with Riku and Akane</a></h2>
								<p>Akane walked over with Riku about 3:30 today to do some laundry and for a visit. Riku headed straight into the kitchen, saying "sandals" all the way in. Yes, he was ready to go right out to the yard and stayed there for two full hours, keeping himself happy and busy. He really wanted the hose, but I managed to talk him into watering my plants with a plastic pitcher instead. When that was done I swept the<br />
yard while Riku filled his big dump truck with pine needles. My yard is looking good these days with all the time we spend out there. </p>
<p>Riku had a few "firsts" today, the first of which was his saying "blue jay?" instead of his usual "bird?". Riku has learned to make a clucking sound, just as I do, to try to attract their attention. Wee Bryn did this same thing and I have him on tape clucking away. </p>
<p>I took out a collapsible chair I bought for Riku in Nanaimo, set it up for him and put a little wooden stool beside it with some snacks for him... his water bottle, a whole wheat Fig Newton, and some dried fruit. Riku was very pleased with his little picnic area and it was obvious to us how much he was enjoying it all. Akane mentioned that he was "in heaven", with the freedom to go in and out of the house, as well as spend all that time outside with so many ways to keep busy. Oh, we blew bubbles too. Riku can't quite blow them himself but gave the dipping process a few tries. </p>
<p>Riku "walked the beam" today for the first time. For some months I have been holding Riku's hand while he walked along narrow boards or walls. Sometimes Doug or I will do it as well, and it always makes him smile. Today the big smile was on Riku's face, as on his own he decided to give it a try and was very successful. He is very careful and didn't fall once although he did it many times over the afternoon. </p>
<p>We ended our short time together with a "splash" which is one of Riku's favourite activities... tub time! It is such a pleasure to sit on the floor beside the tub and see how he keeps himself busy. Tonight he was quite intrigued with Robin, the boy doll, and how they have certain matching parts. </p>
<p>Ah, speaking of parts... today I taught Riku where his shoulders are, and it was very sweet to see him point those little index fingers at those tiny little shoulders. </p>
<p>Bryn showed up to take them home, stayed around long enough for a little visit with us too, and off they went taking along a smiling happy little fellow. He had had a full and very busy day, as Akane told me later that he was in bed just after seven p.m. ... very unusual for him. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/08/wednesday_with_riku_and_amelia.html">Wednesday with Riku and Amelia</a></h2>
								<p>It was a lovely morning today; I had told Akane I would take Riku so she could run some errands and get started packing for the trip to Japan. Rather than have Bryn drop Riku off, I went over to pick him up, thinking he would enjoy the walk back to our house. Good decision; the sun wasn't out yet but the air was warm. A seven-minute walk to his house took thirty-five minutes on the return, but Riku saw things on that trip that I missed out on... all the holes in the bottoms of houses, and which required inspection, people to stop and say "HI!" to, including the homeless fellow with the cane. Riku was so intent on striking up a conversation that it worked, and we left the man waving goodbye to this little diplomat. And of course I hadn't noticed just how many stoops there are to sit on between Hampshire Street and Rhode Island! The bridge over the highway took an extra long time to cross as Riku stood for a long time watching the big trucks, the red cars, and the motorcycles pass underneath us. There were two especially big hits on the way home though. The first was a house just down the street from us being painted and there were <strong>six</strong> ladders, and <strong>six</strong> men on them, which meant we spent quite a long time staring up in admiration at this wonderful sight. </p>
<p>The street before ours is very steep, with stairs for a sidewalk and cobbles for the road surface. Riku spotted the steps and decided that was a route worth taking so up and up and up we went. I kept asking if he wanted to turn around now, but "nooo" was his answer and up we continued. His instincts were right as there was a "<strong>digger</strong>" parked in an empty lot. And of course we explored it; we walked over the very bumpy dry dirt, with the tire marks firmly embedded, and Riku touched the tires, inspected the seat, and went forward to have a good close-up look at the big prongs at the front of the machine. Wow! </p>
<p>Home for a big breakfast... toast <strong>and</strong> cereal before naptime and then after having his post-nap snack of dried fruits he asked for "yogurt?" and ate all that up. I could not believe what he ate today! An hour later he ate his lunch, a small bowl of tofu and broccoli with a bit of rice, when I didn't think he would eat anything at all. </p>
<p>Susan and Amelia came by at 1:30 and with both children in their strollers we headed up to Mission Delores Park for a couple of hours. Riku fell asleep almost immediately (I'm sure it was that full tummy!). Amelia was as wide-eyed as usual although she had had a morning nap at home. </p>
<p>The park was lots of fun for both children; Amelia just loves the swings and what a hoot to see those legs moving and kicking in delight each time she swung back! This is such a wonderful age right now as Amelia takes such pleasure in every single thing she sees and does; that big smile of hers is contagious. </p>
<p>They played in the sandbox for a bit but the big draw for both children were all the dogs at this park. Susan counted twenty of them! </p>
<p>Riku loves to wander about and he ended up stooping down to watch some smaller dogs playing and running around their owners. Susan and Amelia joined us, and at one point Riku got up and just walked over and plopped himself down in the midst of this group of dog owners. He is a little nervous when the dogs come up too close to him, but from a foot away he is just smitten with them. </p>
<p>Amelia is happy to let them lick and sniff away and shows no fear whatsoever. She gets so excited when they come close; she is a dog lover, just like her Mom. We said goodbye to Susan and Amelia at 4:30; Amelia had a wee nap on the way home from the park and was awake when we got back here. </p>
<p>The rest of the day passed very quickly; Riku played in the yard with the plastic containers filled with water, and had a very long bath time tonight. He was naming so many letters with his bathtub alphabet that I was amazed at how many he knows. He also spent some time in the tub tonight straightening out who is a boy and who is a girl. We went through all the family members and many friends too, based on whether they had parts like Robin or not. "P" is for penis and it went from there... </p>
<p>I was very surprised at how much pasta Riku ate for dinner, as well as peaches, and a generous portion of applesauce not too much later! His next check-up will show a big jump in weight, I would imagine. We read some books together and at 8 p.m. I walked him home. Akane was out grocery shopping, and Bryn couldn't get his car out of the garage, so Riku and I had lots of time for stories at his house. "Good Night Moon" was one of them, and "Won't You Be My Kissaroo?", as well as one very large book filled with cars and engines; this is a better choice for Grandpa but I tried to be enthusiastic about the engines and the big red cars and trucks! </p>
<p>I left a sleepy little boy ready to nurse and go to bed.</p>
