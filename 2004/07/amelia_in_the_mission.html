								<h2>Amelia in the Mission</h2>
								<p>I emailed Susan last night, suggesting that she bring Amelia over here for two or three hours. I see so much of Amelia in her stroller when I go to walk her in their neighbourhood, and thought it was a good idea to start having her come here once a week. This way we can walk in my neighbourhood, with new sights, sounds, and smells for Amelia, but also to have time in the house with her. Well, it was a good thought, but that's as far as it went today! </p>
<p>Susan dropped off a sleepy little girl at 9:30 a.m. She successfully transferred her from the car to the stroller, but after our deciding what time to meet back here, and chatting a little longer than we should have, Amelia woke up with that smile of hers and decided it was time to party! </p>
<p>So we walked, and we smiled, and we sang some songs (this being the royal "we") as it was obvious that she wasn't going to sleep right away. One hour later she was out like a light, and stayed that way for another two and a half hours! I walked up and down the two long blocks in front of the house, back and forth, in the shade, although amazingly Amelia stayed asleep even when Doug relieved me for a bathroom break. Just three minutes before Susan pulled up she opened her eyes and beamed away at both Doug and me, happy to see familiar faces. </p>
<p>Susan was amazed; Amelia's naps are getting longer and longer which is a good thing indeed. Susan had to try very hard to get Amelia interested in nursing, as there are so very many things to explore in our living room, and Amelia is curious about every single one of them. We had a grand time being amused by Amelia for about an hour; she stood and played with the assorted stuffed chickens on the back of the sofa, tried very hard and successfully to not only get at her mom's glass of water but get her hand in it several times and drink from it too. This is one determined young lady! I had the camera on hand, thank goodness, and managed to get several adorable photos of Amelia, which is not hard to do at all. </p>
<p>Bryn and I caught BART over to Berkeley a few hours later to join Doug for a concert of West African / acoustic folk music which we all enjoyed very much. A grand day for everyone!</p>
