								<h2><a href="/2004/07/by_train_from_san_francisco_to.html">By Train, from San Francisco to Palo Alto, Return</a></h2>
								<p>Doug and I decided it was time to take Riku on a long train ride, now that he knows what trains are all about from his picture books and building sets. We caught the 9:12 a.m. train at the 22nd Street station; Riku's eyes were very big watching the big white lights coming toward us, and was delighted when we climbed aboard. Doug decided that the seats upstairs would give Riku the best view, although he also loved climbing up and down the little winding stairway as well. A little less than an hour later we were in Palo Alto. </p>
<p>Most of downtown Palo Alto was still closed but there was a bookstore open for Doug and a toy store for Riku. What a delight this was for him, as they had a child's "grocery-style" cart made of canvas and wood, which caught his eye immediately. Off he went taking things of interest off the shelves, and putting them in the cart (he looked as though he had been shopping for years; he was <strong>so </strong>efficient at it!)... a big box with latches and drawers, two mushroom-shaped magnifying glasses, two packages of woolen skeins for weaving, and three wooden cars. He was very upset when we had to leave but a fountain in a nearby courtyard soon distracted him.  </p>
<p>Riku napped for a while in his stroller but woke up in time to join us for lunch at Fresh Choice. He ate his own packed lunch and then had a bowl of tapioca pudding, possibly just to keep his Grandpa company. </p>
<p>The next hour and a half was great fun, as we let him walk throughout the Stanford Shopping Centre, a beautiful outdoor mall, with gorgeous flower displays and many pathways to choose from. What a ham he is; he waved to people, stopped to smile at anyone smiling at him, said "hi" to others, smelled the flowers, gently touched the leaves of a few plants, and did his best to entertain the folks sitting admiring him. At one point he put his plastic sippy cup on the ground, and then stooped over to drink from it. He's not far off the ground but it still looked very funny! </p>
<p>Riku does another very silly thing, and I think he knows it's silly... he puts his hands behind him and pats himself on the bottom, and then he crouches down on his haunches. It's his routine!  This caught a few people's attention the two times he did it today... so he was pleased that it still gets a reaction. </p>
<p>Riku was a tired boy on the way home but did his very best to stay awake, looking at passing trains, at buses, trucks, and other passengers, flirting away with them, and managing to keep his eyes open until he got back here. Five minutes after handing him his monkey and dog sleeping companions he was sound asleep and slept for forty-five minutes. </p>
<p>For the very first time today Riku <em>insisted</em> on having a tub. I was ready to go upstairs with him, as he had indicated that that was what he wanted to do when he awoke. However, we were in the bathroom together and when I opened the door to head upstairs he shut it firmly and said "splash, splash". We didn't have a lot of play time left so I opened the door and stepped out of the bathroom; Riku came out into the hallway, took my hand and led me back into the bathroom, shut the door firmly, pulling the mat off the tub and heading for his toys in the hamper. So, into the tub he went with lots of tub toys, and two dolls this time. </p>
<p>Bryn picked him up at 6 p.m. Riku gave him a big "hiiii", and when Bryn asked for a kiss, Riku walked over and gave him a big smile and a kiss as well. Very sweet to see. A few minutes later off he went, a little reluctantly, but it's always easier for him to leave if I walk down to the car with him and stand to wave goodbye. </p>
<p>Doug and I left a half hour later to attend a music concert he had won tickets to... great music with fabulous fiddling, which was good, as it kept me awake!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/07/the_end_of_a_busy_week.html">The End of a Busy Week</a></h2>
								<p>My weekdays usually start off PalTalking with at least one of my sisters; today was a rare exception and it just didn't seem quite right. We usually meet at 7 a.m. Pacific Time, which is 10 a.m. for Candy and Beth. However, when I opened up PalTalk I was the only one there. "Sad", Gail would say, and it was. </p>
<p>The day continued to be quiet and atypical; Doug and I went off to do some grocery shopping, decided to have a burrito out (a treat) which is not something we often do during the week, and spent the entire day at home. No doubt my body is wondering when the two hour walk is coming! </p>
<p>Instead I got started on dinner prepartions for Doug's 60th birthday party tomorrow... we're having Mexican food, instead of our usual Italian, so I grated cheese, cooked some chard for a casserole, cooked up some veggies for quesadillas, and made the cheesecake. It always tastes better if made a day or two ahead of time. </p>
<p>Tay dropped by with a new dish; she spends a lot of time developing new recipes and often kindly shares them with us. Today it was a delicious chickpea, potato, and fresh tomato Indian flavoured dish, but not a curry. I added some fresh corn off the cob, and we had it along with a delicious piece of garlic naan (which Tay had brought over last week, along with several other very tasty food items). </p>
<p>Instead of going to the concert we planned to attend tonight, I am heading upstairs with a hot cup of tea, and plan to put my feet up and watch a movie with Doug. Ah, the end of a busy week.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/07/dougs_60th_birthday_celebratio.html">Doug's 60th Birthday Celebration</a></h2>
								<p>Akane, Riku, Bryn, Amelia, Susan, and Kevin joined us at 1361 Rhode Island Street for an early birthday celebration dinner. We started with appetizers of tortilla chips, salsa and guacamole, and grapes and raw veggies too, and then at 5:15 sat down to a Mexican dinner of a chard and bean casserole, and fresh cooked corn and mixed vegetable burritos. </p>
<p>Bryn had prepped Riku earlier in the day by singing "Happy Birthday" a few times, mentioning Grandpa in the "dear Grandpa" part of the song, and some time later when Bryn asked whose birthday it was, he was right there with the answer. </p>
<p>Riku loves a party, especially one with balloons and a crowd too, so he was a very happy and excited little boy from the moment he walked into the house. He sat at the head of the table and loved being part of it all. Seeing Doug blow out the candles brought out his big smiles, and Doug repeated it a couple of times so he could enjoy it more than once. </p>
<p>Doug received lots of food items for his birthday this year! This was a good thing, as there were lots of very good chocolate items, as well as a night at the Buck Owens theatre with Bryn at some date a little further along, and a two hour boat rental in Horseshoe Bay from Kelly and Gregg. All four children in Toronto sent home-made cards to Doug, which are lined up on the mantle along with the others that came in over the past few days. </p>
<p>Doug always requests a cheesecake for his birthday cake, and so he had it once again... not so much left over this year for breakfasts! I might have to make another one. Riku had a piece of it too and seems to share the same opinion as his Dad and Grandpa... he's a fan. </p>
<p>Tay and Mike dropped in for a slice of cake and to extend their good wishes too. It was a lovely evening... Happy Birthday to Doug!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/07/the_4th_of_july.html">The 4th of July</a></h2>
								<p>We celebrated the 4th of July with Akane, Bryn, and Riku on the roof of 1090 Hampshire Street. Loud booms and bangs were heard much earlier in the evening but we held out until 9:30 p.m. when the "official" fireworks started. It was cool and we all bundled up and had a great view of the city, despite the low-hanging fog surrounding us. </p>
<p>Riku had been saying "boom!" downstairs but once we were up in the open air those booms were really loud! He was enthralled though, with all the colours, the various noises, and our reactions too. "Wow!", "big" and "boom" were the words Riku used to describe his first viewing of the 4th of July fireworks.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/07/a_quiet_relaxed_monday.html">A Quiet, Relaxed Monday</a></h2>
								<p>Doug and I went off to see two movies today; I was ready to put my feet up and relax with nothing more to do than sit there! We saw "Fahrenheit 9/11" followed by "The Corporation". They were both tough films to watch, especially the former, but we had been waiting all week to see them. </p>
<p>I was more than ready for a walk after the tension of these films, and the four-plus hours of sitting. We were hoping to steal Amelia away from her parental units for a wee walk, but it was not to be. Kevin answered the door to tell us that Amelia and her mommy were napping... or at least Amelia was. Susan was lying beside her sleeping beauty, reveling in the peace of those particular moments in time... nothing is sweeter indeed!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/07/pier_39_with_riku.html">Pier 39 with Riku</a></h2>
								<p>Today was a happily-anticipated day for Doug and me: we were going to take Riku on the bus to Pier 39 to see the sea lions. Riku is quite taken with buses, as most children his age are, and he was a happy camper sitting on my lap by the window pointing out all that he could see... motorcycles, buses, taxis, police cars, bikes, signs, little holes under the window, the long black hair of the woman in front of us, etc. </p>
<p>He had some running-around time on a patch of grass when we first arrived at Ghirardelli Square, and Doug placed him in the crook of a big tree, after Riku saw some big kids up there. He was happy to stand there for a minute but wanted down pretty quickly. </p>
<p>We put Riku in his stroller and walked to Pier 39, through the stands selling fresh shrimp and lobster, looking at all the tourists; it's very busy and Riku is happy to be part of the scene. Alas, the sea lions have gone off to the Channel Islands to breed and won't be back until the fall. What a disappointment! There was only one lone bull, very large, lounging around on the very back pier, so Riku still has no idea what a sea lion is. </p>
<p>Next stop was the carousel, although Riku had more meandering-around time first. Nothing he likes more than a free range, wandering in and out of stores, smiling at people, weaving amongst the crowds with no one holding his hand. He had such a good time and was so entertaining that Doug and I commented that he is just in practice for the entertainer he is cut out to be in the future! Riku waves and smiles and hoots and hollers happily drawing attention to himself and generating lots of smiles along the way. He looked particularly fetching in his new blue and white striped shirt from Auntie Susan and Kevin. </p>
<p>The highlight of Riku's day was the carousel ride; he started grinning from the minute he was put up on the horse. He sat holding the reins, as though he had known how to do this for a long long time. It may have been the jeans he was wearing from his two aunties in Japan that made him feel he was right where he belonged! We had a nice long ride, enough so that Doug got some video of him, but Riku was not happy being taken off that horse. Carousels are a once-a-month activity for sure. </p>
<p>He enjoyed his bus ride home and was more than ready for a thirty-five minute toes-up when we arrived! What a lovely day this was for all of us. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/07/peekaboo_with_amelia_and_a_lat.html">"Peek-a-Boo" with Amelia and a Late Night Riku Visit Too</a></h2>
								<p>Well, Amelia was so entertaining today! We arrived to take her for a walk at 4 p.m., and her mom assured us she was probably ready for a nap. It was a little chilly in the park, with the fog lying low, so she was in a bundle bag in the stroller. She started the walk by pulling the bag as far up to her eyes as she could; she really had to tug as it only came to her shoulders. We would say "Where's Amelia?" and then down would come the cover along with a big big smile. Well, a big smile from both of us guaranteed many repeat performances. We even managed to get a photo of her despite how quickly those peek-a-boos were coming! </p>
<p>I wanted her to settle down for her nap, so had Doug walk just a little further to the side of the stroller, but Amelia would have none of it. This only caused her to strain herself up in order to try to peak over the side of the stroller and beam away at him. It was very funny to see; she likes to make eye contact and I find if she is tired I have to try very hard not to look at her... or that smile comes at me, despite the rubbing of the eyes and the obvious tiredness. </p>
<p>Before giving in, Amelia had one more trick up her sleeve... the wave! It was too hard to get a photo of this, as she moves her hand so quickly, but this is a real honest-to-goodness wave. Amelia waves her hand from side to side and then waits for a wave directed back to her, and then it's her turn, and on it goes. </p>
<p>Amelia finally gave in to a good sound sleep; Doug and I walked right to the end of Stow Lake and around to a waterfall which Doug explored right up to the fourth tier, which we didn't know existed. </p>
<p>Two and a half hours later Amelia was still sleeping; Doug carried her up to her bedroom in the stroller, her mom shut the door, and we quietly left her to her parents care. </p>
<p>Riku came over for a visit about a half hour after we walked in the door. His dad was working and his mom was feeling tired, so a couple of hours with us worked out well for everyone. He played upstairs with the blocks, sat at the computer for five minutes, watched the video of himself on the carousel about five times (he adores looking at himself!), had a Weetabix with fresh peaches, and finished off the evening with a long play in the tub. </p>
<p>I didn't want to put him back in his clothes so found an outfit that belonged to wee Bryn for him to wear home; it is a one-piece cotton outfit, grey, with a copy of a Renoir painting of a mother and child on it. Riku was quite pleased with his new PJs and his parents both thought he looked very cute as well when they came to fetch him at 10 p.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/07/k_is_for_riku.html">"K" is for Riku!</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn is working from home this week, so the mornings are a little less hurried at Hampshire Street. Bryn rings the doorbell when they arrive here, and I dash downstairs to see Riku's little face pressed against the window, squinting through the glass to see my descent of the stairs. To see that beaming smile greeting me each time is such a treat! </p>
<p>A couple of days ago, Susan had passed on a bag of old red plastic movie marquee letters; they were at the foot of the stairs and were the first thing that Riku discovered on entering the house. He pulled out all four letters and walked over to Doug with two of them, saying "K?" and then "Riku", with confidence... and then "O" to which Doug replied that they were indeed a K and an O. Wow!!! We were just amazed and Riku so pleased about our amazement. He said it so sincerely and seriously; it was the sweetest thing.</p>
<p>It was obvious he was going to need a nap before long, so I cooked up a bowl of four grain cereal, and cut into it a quarter of a fresh, organic peach for him. This was a big hit! He repeated "Peach?" each time he scooped up a spoonful of it, and if he scooped up a large portion would say "Big!", nod, and manouevre it in. He also ate a half piece of whole wheat toast with butter, which he always enjoys. </p>
<p>I tucked him in with the monkey and the dog, his bed companions when he is here, and he was asleep in five minutes, for a good forty-five minute nap. </p>
<p>Doug and I had planned to take him to the small playground in Golden Gate park today, but after some time on the computer (he points out his red chair, starts hauling away mine from in front of the computer, and then heads into the living room for the "Pillow?" to boost him up closer to the keyboard), and lunch, it was obvious to me that he wouldn't last without another nap long before we could get to the park. </p>
<p>He and I headed off in the stroller instead to St. Luke's hospital; I had to have the TB test I had done on Tuesday checked out as part of my doula volunteer work. Bryn met us for a walk part of the way, so he could say hello to his little boy, and after he left us Riku stayed awake until after the hospital visit. He had a great time there, making instant friends with the receptionist, drinking water very successfully out of a paper cup whilst very nonchalantly walking around the office, and exploring this new place. </p>
<p>As soon as we left I told him it was nap time, folded up my jacket for a little pillow for him, lowered the back on the stroller and he slept, for an hour and a half! I walked through the Mission District very slowly, bought myself a coconut paleta, sat in a quiet spot near the SF General, read a magazine I had with me, and finally headed for home when Riku started to awaken. </p>
<p>Playtime upstairs in our bedroom (Riku loves my long mirror!) and some story time with the "upstairs books" finished off our day together.</p>
<p><a href="/i/600/20040708161409.jpg"><img alt="Riku and Reflection" height="200" width="150" src="/i/200/20040708161409.jpg"></a></p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/07/amelia_in_the_mission.html">Amelia in the Mission</a></h2>
								<p>I emailed Susan last night, suggesting that she bring Amelia over here for two or three hours. I see so much of Amelia in her stroller when I go to walk her in their neighbourhood, and thought it was a good idea to start having her come here once a week. This way we can walk in my neighbourhood, with new sights, sounds, and smells for Amelia, but also to have time in the house with her. Well, it was a good thought, but that's as far as it went today! </p>
<p>Susan dropped off a sleepy little girl at 9:30 a.m. She successfully transferred her from the car to the stroller, but after our deciding what time to meet back here, and chatting a little longer than we should have, Amelia woke up with that smile of hers and decided it was time to party! </p>
<p>So we walked, and we smiled, and we sang some songs (this being the royal "we") as it was obvious that she wasn't going to sleep right away. One hour later she was out like a light, and stayed that way for another two and a half hours! I walked up and down the two long blocks in front of the house, back and forth, in the shade, although amazingly Amelia stayed asleep even when Doug relieved me for a bathroom break. Just three minutes before Susan pulled up she opened her eyes and beamed away at both Doug and me, happy to see familiar faces. </p>
<p>Susan was amazed; Amelia's naps are getting longer and longer which is a good thing indeed. Susan had to try very hard to get Amelia interested in nursing, as there are so very many things to explore in our living room, and Amelia is curious about every single one of them. We had a grand time being amused by Amelia for about an hour; she stood and played with the assorted stuffed chickens on the back of the sofa, tried very hard and successfully to not only get at her mom's glass of water but get her hand in it several times and drink from it too. This is one determined young lady! I had the camera on hand, thank goodness, and managed to get several adorable photos of Amelia, which is not hard to do at all. </p>
<p>Bryn and I caught BART over to Berkeley a few hours later to join Doug for a concert of West African / acoustic folk music which we all enjoyed very much. A grand day for everyone!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/07/two_unexpected_hours_with_riku.html">Two Unexpected Hours with Riku and Bryn</a></h2>
								<p>Doug and I went off to see a movie this afternoon; it was "The Clearing" with Robert Redford and Helen Mirren, a drama/thriller, which we both enjoyed, mostly because of the superb acting. </p>
<p>Akane was at the studio working; Bryn and Riku had been to the zoo in the afternoon, and Bryn called asking if we would like a certain little someone as company for an hour or so. The answer is always "Of course!" Riku had had a long nap in the car and was still a little dozy, but soon perked up and got busy doing all his familiar favourite things at Nana and Grandpa's house. </p>
<p>He went upstairs to play in the bedroom since Grandpa was up there alone just reading; I'm sure he didn't want Grandpa to be by himself. Riku obviously spent lots of time playing with his plastic blocks, since my bed was covered with them, and Grandpa read a favourite story about cats to him too. </p>
<p>Bryn stayed on as well... reading, having a Coke, and chatting. I started making another cheesecake and Riku came down to sit on the counter, taking much pleasure in watching the bowl go around and around, and taking part in it all. He also pointed out the "K" and "O" (now sitting on a bookshelf in the kitchen) to his Dad, who was very proud of him! </p>
<p>Soon it was time to leave to meet Mommy, but not before Riku had some water time, playing in the kitchen sink; he sat there for the longest time taking such obvious delight in filling up the rubber stopper, spraying the water around using the spray wand and splashing it all about.</p>
<p><a href="/i/600/20040710165407.jpg"><img alt="Riku in the Sink" height="200" width="150" src="/i/200/20040710165407.jpg"></a></p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/07/off_to_the_park.html">Off to the Park</a></h2>
								<p>Doug and I had a lazy morning at home, reading the paper, writing some emails, and puttering about. After a light lunch at home, we went off to the Opera Plaza to see an Icelandic film; once again the acting (by many female characters) was terrific and we enjoyed it. </p>
<p>I had earlier left a message with Akane, saying that we would need a walk later in the day if Riku would like to go to the park, and at 5:30 Akane asked if we would still like to do this. Five minutes later we left with half a banana loaf for them to share... no nuts in it so Riku can eat it too. </p>
<p>Doug followed him from one sandbox to the other, where a little girl took a liking to Riku, giving him some sand and a big kiss! I missed seeing this, and missed lots of other great shots because I forgot to take the camera with us. He and Grandpa spent a lot of time playing in the structured play area, and Riku bumped his head a few times coming down the slide. Riku enjoys walking around wherever his feet take him and this is true more and more; we just let him lead the way and follow him about, doing our best to avoid run-ins with tricycles and bigger children running around. Riku allows us to be his security force and doesn't pay a lot of attention to these distractions. </p>
<p>Following Bryn's example, we let him walk home for five of the six blocks. He stooped to pick loose gravel up from one crack in the sidewalk so he could walk back and deposit it in a new place. He sat on several steps, backing up to them and enjoying a couple of minutes admiring the new view. Large leaves and a very large piece of bark were carried home in both his hands, and some smaller leaves were given to two admirers along the way. Riku stopped to give another leaf away to one of two men outside listening to music playing in their truck, and then made his "more" sign when the music stopped. He smiled happily when it started up again, and off we went once more, home for dinner and time with Mommy and Daddy. </p>
<p>Akane had a treat for us too! We ate some freshly made inari on our walk home; it was warm and too tempting to wait to eat. Inari, which is seasoned rice with black sesame seeds, wrapped inside tofu skin, is just one of my favourite dishes that Akane makes for us. Yum!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/07/last_night_in_sf_for_ten_days.html">Last Night in SF for Ten Days or So...</a></h2>
								<p>Today we decided that we would leave for Vancouver tomorrow for certain, so it was a busy but relaxed day around here preparing for the trip. I PalTalked with all of my sisters this morning and spoke on the phone with Kelly this afternoon as well. Such a treat, as it is a rare event these days.</p>
<p>I did all the laundry, including the ironing, cleared out the fridge, cooked up some spinach and mushrooms, prepared carrots and celery sticks to take with us, as well as a fruit bowl, almonds to snack on, etc., etc. Doug picked up some vegetarian barbecued "ribs" to take to Gail, who likes them as much as we do, and the car has not only a new headlight but four new tires as well.</p>
<p>Akane thoughtfully invited us over for dinner, and we headed over to Hampshire Street at 7 p.m. Riku wanted immediately to play with blocks in his room, so both Doug and I took turns at this. Then he and I looked through a book of Robert Bateman prints, and read the new "flap" book I gave to him and his Daddy for Father's Day, called "Daddies Are for Catching Fireflies".</p>
<p>Dinner followed, a delicious pasta with fresh homemade tomato sauce, and a big bowl of mushrooms to add to it. It particularly hit the spot, as I had made a quick blender tomato sauce of my own today and put it in the freezer. Having spaghetti for dinner was just perfect.</p>
<p>While Akane and Bryn cleared up the dinner dishes, Doug and I took Riku for a walk up to 24th Street. Riku so enjoys meandering, picking up leaves, both "big" and small, collecting bits of paper to throw in the "gaabage", sitting on several sets of steps for a rest, greeting everyone who passes us, and looking around the store shelves while Grandpa bought a Coke.</p>
<p>Back home for cookies and tea, followed by nursing for Riku. We left him ready to be tucked in, after waving goodbye from the bedroom window.</p>

								<p>Susan had kindly sent me several photos of Amelia while I was in B.C., but nothing is quite the same as that little face lighting up when she sees me at the door. Doug was busy on the computer so off I went for a long walk with "my girl". I needed the walk; I wanted to see Amelia, and cleverly arranged for her parents to go to a movie so that I had some time with her alone at home, out of the stroller.</p>
<p>It was quite a cool foggy day on this side of town today, which was fine, as I walked briskly past Stow Lake and so enjoyed it. Amelia was tired and, despite being out for over two hours, slept for just one of them. Those little eyes really fight closing.</p>
<p>Back at her home, she was a joy and a delight despite the too-short nap, and we had a great time together. She stood for the longest time at the back of the sofa, holding on and looking out the window, and moving back and forth. At one point Amelia decided she wanted down and had her head hanging over the front of the sofa. As I have done with Brynnie, Caillie, and Riku, I turned her around and let her slide slowly down. The look of astonishment on her face as I clapped and said "hooray!" was too cute for words, and so we did it over and over and over again. How I wish I had had a camera with me for the look on Susan's face when she saw what her daughter had learned while she was gone!</p>
<p>We looked at and read some books, spun a ball around, and played happily on the floor until Susan and Kevin arrived home. What a lovely few hours this was and as if that weren't enough (and it was!), I also left bearing enough delicious Chinese take-out food for Doug and me for two very generous-sized meals but a <strong>large</strong> takeout container of tiny black jelly beans! ... all mine, as Doug doesn't care for them!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/07/a_sunday_visitor.html">A Sunday Visitor</a></h2>
								<p>Akane and Bryn finally took some time to go to a movie, which meant that we had an extra-special Sunday at 1361 Rhode Island Street. It was a gorgeous day, not too hot and perfect for working in the garden. Riku is always happy to assist me, so off we went with two brooms, some plastic buckets filled with water, cups, and nothing but a diaper, a shirt, and rubber sandals for him. He worked away with his water toys while I started sweeping, and, as things were looking better, Riku joined me. He kept very busy putting mounds of pollen into his truck with his hands; I transferred it into the big container and he went off to fill it up again. Riku decided some of the larger rocks ("heavy!") needed rearranging, so he spent some time figuring out which went where. We spent a good two hours outside today; we bought a new garden chair for him in Nanaimo, so that became the place for his snacks and water bottle.</p>
<p>As a reward for our hard work, before Riku went home, we sat at the table for another "snack" (one of Riku's favourite words, along with "Hi!", "Splash"... for a tub, and "Uh-oh!"), and he daintily ate one of his favourites, a slice of Nana's lightly buttered banana bread, his Great-Grandpa Dyment's favourite too. I frequently make one without nuts for Riku and his Grandpa and one with for his Dad, Mom, and Auntie Susan.</p>
<p>Speaking of Auntie Susan, I asked him at one point if he had been to visit Auntie Susan and Amelia the day before. Riku really listens and pays attention to what is being said and he nodded seriously and then added "and Kebin"... he and Kevin are great pals and enjoy each other's company a lot. I think they both enjoy being silly and encourage each other.</p>
<p>How lucky we are to have such a large and loving family circle here.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/07/monday_moments_with_riku.html">Monday Moments with Riku</a></h2>
								<p>Riku is learning so many new things, so quickly, that we are constantly amazed by him. Bryn mentioned to me yesterday that he has realized that Riku, the baby, has turned into Riku, the little boy. Of course, some folks have pointed this out to us earlier... how grown-up he seems to be in his photos, but there has been a big change over the past two weeks in his own little person. He's coming into his own distinct Riku personality and coming on fast! </p>
<p>Riku loves to dance; both here and at home he has little keyboards that he can turn on by himself (and turns them off when he has finished with them!) and then we watch him go. No one enjoys this more than Riku himself, as he always has a mirror right there to observe every step and arm motion. At my house he uses the lower oven glass window, and at home he has a full length mirror in his room. He claps, shimmies down low, and thanks to his Nana's disco moves, now thrusts his arms above his head occasionally. Riku doesn't want to dance alone though, and makes sure that he engages everyone else around in his dance routine. You can see him watching to see if there is anything new to add to his repertoire. What fun this is; he's been at it for a few weeks now, mostly at home, but the dance moves have really taken off from just the handclapping of a month ago. </p>
<p>Riku took his own sandals off today. He had been playing with tubs and cups of water in the back yard, and when he came in I asked him to take his sandals off. To my surprise, he immediately bent down, ripped apart the velcro fasteners and then shook them off when Doug put him on his lap. However, the second time I asked him, an hour or so later, he did the whole thing on his own, pulling them off his feet and looking very pleased when Doug and I both clapped. </p>
<p>While we were sitting at the table eating lunch he pointed out the "O" and "K" plastic signs, telling me what each was. Then I spelled out his name... "R I K U" and he immediately said "Riku". Wow! </p>
<p>Riku once again had clerks at the two stores we went to today totally taken with this friendly sweet little boy; he has flirting down to a fine art and always leaves his fans wanting more. </p>
<p>At naptime today, Riku decided to add yet another stuffed animal to his already full arms while falling asleep... a little white mouse joined the menagerie today and he walked around holding a new-to-him big fluffy squirrel with a great long tail. Someone in the past bought this for Brynnie I believe and it has been tucked away in storage. Today Riku made up for the neglect by kissing it, and holding it gently against him, walking around the house. My Mom would have commented on how loved this little boy is to treat his dolls and stuffed animals so kindly and lovingly. </p>
<p>Grandpa read Riku one of the new books he found for him in Nanaimo; Riku was very intent and looked hard for the ladybug on each page.</p>
