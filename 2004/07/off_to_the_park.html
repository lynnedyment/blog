								<h2>Off to the Park</h2>
								<p>Doug and I had a lazy morning at home, reading the paper, writing some emails, and puttering about. After a light lunch at home, we went off to the Opera Plaza to see an Icelandic film; once again the acting (by many female characters) was terrific and we enjoyed it. </p>
<p>I had earlier left a message with Akane, saying that we would need a walk later in the day if Riku would like to go to the park, and at 5:30 Akane asked if we would still like to do this. Five minutes later we left with half a banana loaf for them to share... no nuts in it so Riku can eat it too. </p>
<p>Doug followed him from one sandbox to the other, where a little girl took a liking to Riku, giving him some sand and a big kiss! I missed seeing this, and missed lots of other great shots because I forgot to take the camera with us. He and Grandpa spent a lot of time playing in the structured play area, and Riku bumped his head a few times coming down the slide. Riku enjoys walking around wherever his feet take him and this is true more and more; we just let him lead the way and follow him about, doing our best to avoid run-ins with tricycles and bigger children running around. Riku allows us to be his security force and doesn't pay a lot of attention to these distractions. </p>
<p>Following Bryn's example, we let him walk home for five of the six blocks. He stooped to pick loose gravel up from one crack in the sidewalk so he could walk back and deposit it in a new place. He sat on several steps, backing up to them and enjoying a couple of minutes admiring the new view. Large leaves and a very large piece of bark were carried home in both his hands, and some smaller leaves were given to two admirers along the way. Riku stopped to give another leaf away to one of two men outside listening to music playing in their truck, and then made his "more" sign when the music stopped. He smiled happily when it started up again, and off we went once more, home for dinner and time with Mommy and Daddy. </p>
<p>Akane had a treat for us too! We ate some freshly made inari on our walk home; it was warm and too tempting to wait to eat. Inari, which is seasoned rice with black sesame seeds, wrapped inside tofu skin, is just one of my favourite dishes that Akane makes for us. Yum!</p>
