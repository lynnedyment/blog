								<h2>"Peek-a-Boo" with Amelia and a Late Night Riku Visit Too</h2>
								<p>Well, Amelia was so entertaining today! We arrived to take her for a walk at 4 p.m., and her mom assured us she was probably ready for a nap. It was a little chilly in the park, with the fog lying low, so she was in a bundle bag in the stroller. She started the walk by pulling the bag as far up to her eyes as she could; she really had to tug as it only came to her shoulders. We would say "Where's Amelia?" and then down would come the cover along with a big big smile. Well, a big smile from both of us guaranteed many repeat performances. We even managed to get a photo of her despite how quickly those peek-a-boos were coming! </p>
<p>I wanted her to settle down for her nap, so had Doug walk just a little further to the side of the stroller, but Amelia would have none of it. This only caused her to strain herself up in order to try to peak over the side of the stroller and beam away at him. It was very funny to see; she likes to make eye contact and I find if she is tired I have to try very hard not to look at her... or that smile comes at me, despite the rubbing of the eyes and the obvious tiredness. </p>
<p>Before giving in, Amelia had one more trick up her sleeve... the wave! It was too hard to get a photo of this, as she moves her hand so quickly, but this is a real honest-to-goodness wave. Amelia waves her hand from side to side and then waits for a wave directed back to her, and then it's her turn, and on it goes. </p>
<p>Amelia finally gave in to a good sound sleep; Doug and I walked right to the end of Stow Lake and around to a waterfall which Doug explored right up to the fourth tier, which we didn't know existed. </p>
<p>Two and a half hours later Amelia was still sleeping; Doug carried her up to her bedroom in the stroller, her mom shut the door, and we quietly left her to her parents care. </p>
<p>Riku came over for a visit about a half hour after we walked in the door. His dad was working and his mom was feeling tired, so a couple of hours with us worked out well for everyone. He played upstairs with the blocks, sat at the computer for five minutes, watched the video of himself on the carousel about five times (he adores looking at himself!), had a Weetabix with fresh peaches, and finished off the evening with a long play in the tub. </p>
<p>I didn't want to put him back in his clothes so found an outfit that belonged to wee Bryn for him to wear home; it is a one-piece cotton outfit, grey, with a copy of a Renoir painting of a mother and child on it. Riku was quite pleased with his new PJs and his parents both thought he looked very cute as well when they came to fetch him at 10 p.m.</p>
