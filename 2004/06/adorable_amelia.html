								<h2>Adorable Amelia</h2>
								<p>Amelia and I set out for our park walk late this afternoon. It was a little windy which meant the trees were lively enough that Amelia stayed awake to watch. She doesn't want to miss out on a thing, this girl! I did the usual swaying stroller routine, hoping to coax her into a wee nap, but she wasn't having any of it. </p>
<p>I should have had the camera with me today as Amelia looked particularly darling in a flower embroidered soft blue jumper with white tights and shoes on to complete the outfit. Her big white brimmed hat completed the photo op... and there I was without one! </p>
<p>For the first time ever Amelia cried when I had her out, so thinking a burp was hiding I took her out at the children's playground for ten minutes of looking at the "big kids" on the swings. She won over another grandma there with her friendly smile and off we went again, wtih another fan in her world. </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin were hanging art work up when we arrived; the apartment looks like home more and more each day, and except for a dining room table I would say they are 97% there! </p>
<p>Amelia now has <em>six</em> teeth, four on top and two on the bottom, and her mom told me that she pulled herself up to a standing position this week! Ah, she's growing up already.  :)</p>
<p>I didn't expect to see Riku again today, but Bryn and I made a mad dash over to each others houses last night, expecting to meet somewhere in between but missing!, and so I ended up back at their place for some reading time with Riku. What a fine end to my day. Riku held up his arm while we were reading and pointing to the correct part said "elbow" very clearly; he was rewarded with a smile from his proud Nana...</p>
