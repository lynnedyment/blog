								<h2><a href="/2004/06/blah_blah_blah.html">Blah Blah Blah</a></h2>
								<p>Riku is learning new things every day and today was a red letter day, with three "awww moments". </p>
<p>I was speaking on the phone with my friend Tay, and finished off a sentence by saying "blah, blah, blah"... Riku looked up at me and said "blah, blah, blah" and after hearing me laugh out loud continued to say "blah, blah, blah" for another two or three minutes whenever I walked by him. </p>
<p>Today Riku called out to me for the very first time; I was in the kitchen and he was wandering in the hallway and his room (or so I thought). Then I heard "Nana?", then a pause, another "Nana?' and another pause followed by a third one. I looked around the corner and there he sat on the fourth stair up, waiting to be given permission to continue up to our bedroom... which of course we did. </p>
<p>As usual, while we were sitting at the table we were flipping through magazines looking for something interesting. Riku has been quite fascinated with some pics of women athletes from the weekend magazine and stopped at one showing a swimmer's back. I told him that was her back, and then patted his and said "Riku's back" and then pulled up my shirt to show him my back. A few minutes later I asked him where his back was and he shrugged sideways with his head cocked over his shoulder to indicate that he did indeed now know where his back was! </p>
<p>I finished off my day by taking Amelia out for a stroller ride/sleep while her parents did some unpacking. She showed her absolute pleasure by blowing some wonderfully loud raspberries at me, accompanied by lots of liquid bubbles as well; it's our favourite thing to do right now and makes me laugh each time.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/a_foggy_sf_morning.html">A Foggy SF Morning</a></h2>
								<p>Walked with sweet Amelia in the early morning fog today; her new home is right across the street from the Panhandle so we strolled through the mist, both of us admiring the massive eucalyptus trees, the various pines, and a few palm trees thrown in for some west coast variety. What an odd but wonderful assortment of greenery and the smell of the eucalyptus was intensified by the heavy mist. Amelia decided it was far too fine a day to nap!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/a_perfectly_lovely_sunday.html">A Perfectly Lovely Sunday</a></h2>
								<p>Riku spent a rare Sunday with us today and what a lovely day it was! The sky was blue, the sun was shining, and Riku was able to wander upstairs, downstairs, and in and out of the back yard at his leisure. He had lots of fun with water play in the yard, filling various buckets and containers over and over, ate lunch with his Grandpa and Nana, had two short naps, one starting in my arms... heaven!...  to recharge his batteries, and ended his day at the playground, sitting happily in the sand box and doing the rounds of the grassy area with his "Bompa". </p>
<p>Doug and I walked him home and I changed Riku into a clean set of clothes; they were off to visit with Susan, Kevin, and Amelia. It was a perfect ending of the day for me too, as Doug took some great shots of me with Riku in his room. We have such fun together and don't have enough photos of the two of us! <a href="/i/2004-06-06%201332%2718%20%28blog%29.jpg"><img height="200" src="/i/2004-06-06%201332%2718%20%28blog%29-thumb.jpg" width="133"></a> <a href="/i/600/20040606170831.jpg"><img alt="Riku and I" height="200" width="150" src="/i/200/20040606170831.jpg"></a></p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/amelia_and_nana_go_to_the_park.html">Amelia and Nana Go to the Park</a></h2>
								<p>Amelia is cutting new teeth and napping during the day is just not part of her agenda right now. So off we went for a lovely long afternoon stroll to Golden Gate Park, walking through the Haight Ashbury District on our way, where one aged hippie told Amelia she was the cutest baby girl in the whole wide world! I agreed wholeheartedly with her, of course.</p>
<p>It was a breezy day, but a perfect one as well, with lots of sunshine and a beautiful blue sky. We spent most of our time in the children's playground, where Kelly and I spent so many hours with Bryn and Caillie on their visits here. There is a fabulous set of curvy and very long slides, where the children use cardboard boxes to make their trip down even faster. One day Riku and Amelia will enjoy these as much as Bryn and Caillie did.</p>
<p>However, today we just sat on a glider, while Amelia slept, and then we held hands all the way home. Once in a while Amelia, while sitting and watching the children play, would reach up to touch my cheek; she was in a Baby Bjorn carrier on my chest, facing outwards, instead of in her stroller, as usual. It was such a perfect way to spend a few hours; Susan got some unpacking done and we had exercise and playtime outside. Hardly seems fair!</p>
<p>I also got to feed Amelia her first applesauce ever. She liked it a lot and leaned forward for more, but once in a while would do a little shudder and make a funny face...  these new foods are sometimes a challenge, but I would say I got three stars out of four (for my organic homemade applesauce).</p>
<p>Later in the evening I called Riku for a little chat on the phone. He doesn't say much right now , but does love to listen, and rewarded me with a few "Nana!" s... so dear to my heart. He practices quite a bit on his own play cell phones and gets to do all the chatting on those. </p>
<p>I am a very lucky woman, having these two children here in the city with me. How I would have loved having Bryn and Caillie so close by.<br />

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/tuesday_with_riku.html">Tuesday with Riku</a></h2>
								<p>Riku is learning so much so quickly these days; I write these new skills down each day, as I know I would soon forget just when most of them took place.</p>
<p>Today Riku was playing in the kitchen with a set of five stacking/nesting cups that Gail bought him for his bath last year. For the first time, he brought them into the kitchen and started stacking them. Then he decided to nest them and it was the most amazing thing to watch... he put them all in a circle and then attempted to put one inside the other; he got two right immediately but twice put a bigger one on top of a smaller one. Riku knew that this wasn't right and so picked up the next one to try. He was very methodical about it and I was amazed at how quickly he figured it all out. There was no question that he knew how it should look when it was done, as he sat back with quite a look of satisfaction on his face when he had finished with it. Wow!</p>
<p>Tuesday is ironing day around here, so I set up the board and went off to get the clothes. When I came back Riku had started to place his cars on the board, and thought it was just a great little platform for one of his favourite activities, playing with his cars. The ironing was done after he moved on to something new. </p>
<p>Riku knows his Grandpa is missing (he's in Phoenix) and a few times today would look over at Doug's chair at the computer and say "Bompa?" They are quite a pair those two... a mutual admiration society for sure.</p>
<p>This lovely day ended with okonomiyaki prepared by Akane; Riku sat at the table with us, eating his tomato slices, spinach with sesame seed paste, and long slim noodles with seasoning, oh-so-nicely with his spoon.</p>
<p>Actually the day ended with my losing at the first game of cards we three have played in too many months, but I thought it wasn't worth mentioning...</p>
<p><a href="/i/600/20040608103917.jpg"><img alt="Riku, practicing his parking skills" height="150" width="200" src="/i/200/20040608103917.jpg"></a></p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/my_san_francisco_girl.html">My San Francisco Girl</a></h2>
								<p>Walking Amelia means discovering new places in the city; I've been to Golden Gate Park many times but now access is close and immediate, so we're exploring. I had three hours out with Amelia this morning, it was another beautiful day, and so we walked and walked... through a beautiful dahlia garden (or Lady-in-the-Lighthouse, as Gram called them), and through the most gorgeous rose garden, where I stopped many times to smell the roses. From there I discovered a wonderful playground, perfect for young children, complete with huge sandbox areas and smaller pint-sized equipment, just perfect for Riku right now, and soon to be perfect for Amelia too. Further along, much further, was Stow Lake, so I walked around that one and a half times, deciding that next spring, when the Dyment/Tilston crew arrives we will rent paddle boats and see the amazing waterfall up close. Amelia slept for an hour and a half and woke up smiling, as always. </p>
<p>Late this afternoon we had another shorter walk, and on the way home Amelia surprised me with a very unexpected loud, very loud!, squeal... sheer pleasure, so I imitated her and we exchanged squeals until she decided to go back to her loud and wet raspberries. </p>
<p>Just before I left her with her mom tonight she surprised us both with a new skill; Susan had just installed a new light plate in her room, Amelia was admiring it and Susan held her close to see and touch it... and she turned it on, and then off! Red letter day at the Doering/Ellis household, and Amelia was as pleased with herself as we were... big grins and claps all 'round!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/a_busy_thursday.html">A Busy Thursday</a></h2>
								<p>Riku arrived to spend the day with us just after 8 a.m., our usual Thursday date. He was such a busy boy today... his first word when he walks in is usually "cars?" and then off he goes to get his tin of cars and trucks from his room. However, today he said "Bompa" first and then got his cars and took them to Grandpa. </p>
<p>He didn't want Doug to put him down for the first hour here; he had missed him and was determined to make up for lost time. We made orange juice, he napped after a big breakfast, and had water play in the house! which he thoroughly enjoyed. See photos in <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3dte8" target="_new">his album</a>. </p>
<p>I gave him water with his lunch and he said "orange juice?", asking for it for the very first time. About 3 p.m. we headed off to pick up Amelia and with both children in their strollers went to Golden Gate Park... to feed the birds and to visit the children's playground.  Grandpa fed the birds while Riku tried very hard to climb into the huge spouting water fountain. We walked further than we intended to, so, instead of playing in the sandbox, Riku had a nap. </p>
<p>Amelia didn't; she had just wakened from a nap and kept herself busy, not missing out on one thing, from her seat with a view! </p>
<p>I felt a new tooth in Amelia's mouth after taking her home! Tooth number four, but instead of another tooth beside the top middle one, she decided to skip over and cut the one next to it instead. We think there are lots of teeth about to pop out very soon, which explains why Amelia hasn't been sleeping much these days (see new Amelia pics in <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yuaoo" target="_new">her album</a>). </p>
<p>We're off to bed; all this fresh air and exercise is making Nana and Grandpa very sleepy.&nbsp; :)</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/two_hours_with_riku_friday_nig.html">Two Hours with Riku... Friday Night</a></h2>
								<p>Doug and I were invited over to Hampshire Street tonight (Doug for a blogging lesson... how to process photos for my blog) and me for a coconut macaroon and tea. Of course it was also for an end-of-the-day visit with Riku for both of us. </p>
<p>Riku entertained me by pointing out covers on various CDs and then imitating the pictures on each... opening his mouth wide for one, stamping his feet with another, and the funniest one... arching his back <b>waaay</b> back and stretching his arms over his head. He also did his first donkey-kick demo and I was amazed at his balancing skills. He laughed out loud when I crawled on my hands and knees under his Dad's and Grandpa's legs, to follow him around the coffee table. We played with a new car and bus in his room and he pointed out and said "engine" for the first time to me. Akane has been pointing out engines to him in the big automobile books he has been so taken with the past two months or more. He happily shared my macaroon with me, and then accepted kisses goodnight even though he was very anxious to go to bed and nurse. A little Riku time was the perfect end to a busy day.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/happy_birthday_tay_and_a_few_r.html">Happy Birthday Tay, and a Few Riku Moments Too</a></h2>
								<p>Last week, I won tickets to a movie "The Mother", plus a $30 gift certificate towards lunch at a very nice seafood restaurant called "McCormick's and Kuleto's", located at Ghirardelli Square. I had grilled wild King salmon with saffron rice and vegetables, and Doug enjoyed mahi mahi with mashed potatoes and veg'. Yum! We plan to see the movie on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Off we went to see what I thought was a very very boring Canadian movie; I walked out before my snoring woke up everyone else in the audience! </p>
<p> Today is Tay's birthday and at 8 p.m. we joined Tay, Mike, and their lovely daughter Cody for a most delicious fresh fruit tart and orange chocolate truffles, served up with good conversation and some laughs. </p>
<p>Following that, we stopped in at Hampshire Street so Doug could say "au revoir" to Riku; Doug is off to Houston tomorrow, arriving back home on Thursday morning. </p>
<p>Riku is becoming quite the "Bompa's" boy; he immediately led Doug into his room so they could leaf through the big car book... you know, engines, steering wheels, tires... all that kind of thing. They shared some guy time together while I chatted with Bryn and Akane. </p>
<p>I ended up leaving my early birthday gift from Tay there with Riku, who was busy looking at it as we were saying goodbye... "My First Thousand Words in Japanese". I'm hoping he will help me with it; he's already ahead of me as I believe I now have three Japanese words down pat. I'm a quick study... :)</p>
<p>Akane cut Riku's hair two days ago and I just adore the way it looks, with short bangs and layered so that his waves are showing.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/marvellous_monday.html">Marvellous Monday</a></h2>
								<p>Why marvellous? Because today I saw both Riku <strong>and</strong> Amelia, a bonus day for sure! Akane and I went off this morning with Riku, to the doctor, for his eighteen month check-up. Riku had a wonderful time in the office playing with big stacking blocks and various stuffed animals, including Snoopy, whom he gave a big hug. Next time I shall take my camera along; photo opportunity missed for sure. While waiting for the doctor to arrive in the examination room Riku took the car key, slid it underneath the door and then turned to look at us, shrugging his shoulders as if to say he had no idea what happened to it, and then gave us a big grin when we opened the door for him to "discover" it... over and over. Riku is doing very well, his chart lines are just where they should be, and the doctor was very pleased with his overall health. The stats tell us he is a smallish boy with a big head... 25th percentile for height, 15 for weight, and 95 for head circumference! He had his second polio shot and since Akane nursed him through this one it was less traumatic for him; he cried only seconds and then took comfort in his mom's arms. Luckily Riku has never had a reaction to any of his shots so once the deed is done that's the end of it. </p>
<p>It was a long wait from beginning to end, and we were all hungry when the appointment was over, so off we went for lunch out, a rare event for the three of us. Riku happily sat in a high chair eating his fresh tomatoes and tortellini packed lunch, while Akane and I had a sandwich each. Next stop was at Rainbow Groceries where Riku takes such pleasure in walking on his own up and down whatever aisle catches his interest, smiling and waving at friendly shoppers, stopping to arrange a set of boxes of tea or whatever, (but always putting them back in place), helping the man at the produce section by relieving him of the plastic inserts for the fresh peaches, and being just delighted when spotting his mommy in one of his sojourns throughout the big store. I walk a few respectable steps behind him during this adventure to give him some freedom. He knows I'm there and turns to smile at me occasionally, continuing on to the next adventure. </p>
<p>An hour after arriving home, and after a fortifying cup of hot tea, I drove off to Ashbury Street to pick up the girl who gives me the <strong>biggest</strong> smiles in the world! We set off for a long walk, through the Panhandle, into Golden Gate Park with all the new groupings of young hippies, around the beautifully restored carousel (which she went on for the first time last week with her Mom), back up Haight Street and then several trips up and down the Panhandle as the sun was setting. </p>
<p>Amelia held off napping for 75 minutes and then dropped into a very deep sleep. I think I could have walked her through 'til 10 p.m. but thought her parents might worry about her being out so late!.. so the minute she opened her big blue eyes just a little I spoke to her, she slowly came to, and off we went home at 8:30. </p>
<p>Susan told me last night that Amelia was a very happy girl in her bath that night and had a very good night's sleep, despite our concern that she would be wide awake due to that late nap. I slept well myself... :)</p>
<p><a href="/i/600/20040609105823.jpg"><img alt="Amelia, peering out at the sights" height="150" width="200" src="/i/200/20040609105823.jpg"></a></p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/my_day_with_riku_and_a_ps.html">My Day with Riku, and a P.S.</a></h2>
								<p>Riku was late arriving this morning, so I managed to get a few jobs done around the house before his Dad dropped him off at the front door. Riku peers through the glass doors at me, and when he sees me coming down the stairs that big smile lights up his face. What a way to start a day! </p>
<p>When I put a little bowl of raisins in front of him for his snack, he peered up at them and said "coffee?" I did see how he could have made this mistake from a distance. He happily ate every single one, very daintily, with one finger up in the air, before eating his half slice of whole wheat toast. </p>
<p>Off he went upstairs to play with stacking plastic blocks in our room, and admiring himself in the mirror frequently. He now has a full length mirror in his own room too, which is great, as it gets a lot of use! Wee Bryn didn't ever bother checking himself out, Caillie did from the time she was the tiniest little girl, and Riku is just as taken with himself as Caillie was with herself. Interesting... </p>
<p>I always take this time while he plays upstairs to do some sorting of photo paraphernalia, so it works out well for both of us. He has a small collection of books up there and we often sit on the bed and go through a few of those too. </p>
<p>He had a forty-five minute nap holding both Bryn's wee dog (wa wa) and the monkey Garry gave him (Riku says "eek eek" for the monkey) in his arms for the whole nap. Then it was time for water play as it was just a gorgeous warm and sunny day. I took off his shorts and let him sit in the puddles in his diapers; pouring water from one big container, into a smaller one, into a big square one, over and over is such a grand activity for him right now. When he was finally done and the water had been replenished several times he surprised me by picking up a big cloth I had kept by the door (just in case) and wiping down his legs with it! Oh, he also put peanuts out for the blue jay and the jay came within a foot of him to eat, while Riku sat quietly looking at him with interest. </p>
<p>We went off to look for new sandals for him, but fifteen minutes after leaving the house Riku fell asleep, and stayed asleep for an hour and twenty minutes. I did wander into a couple of stores but could only find camouflage! sandals in his size, and nothing suitable anywhere else. </p>
<p>Akane picked him up just as we had come into the house after his snack in the stroller, and he wasn't happy to not have some play time with his cars, or run about for a while... I had to leave at 5:30... I'm sure he was very glad to get home with his mom to nurse though; the leaving for all of us was just a little tough today, due to circumstances beyond his control!</p>
<p>p.s. I went to a wonderful free movie with a friend, Maxine. It was an early viewing of a movie opening here on Friday. If you have an opportunity to see "The Story of a Crying Camel", don't miss it... set in Mongolia with wonderful acting, spectacular scenery and a story that is funny, touching, and oh-so-well done. The popcorn was good too!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/sf_mini_climates.html">SF Mini Climates...</a></h2>
								<p>It was a beautiful warm sunny day in Potrero Hill this morning; I sat at the table with the back door wide open, the sun streaming in, and my shirt sleeves rolled up. I had a very productive day and completed my weekly ironing, as well as many phone calls, and a lot of boring paper work. </p>
<p>I needed a break and, with luck, Amelia needed a sleep so off I went to pick her up at 4 p.m. It was cool and very breezy over in that part of town; I had a jacket with me and needed it, although once I started walking briskly the temps mysteriously rose... funny how that happens. </p>
<p>Amelia was asleep within ten minutes of leaving her house (her Mom knew she was a tired girl, and she was right). I stopped at a little market on Haight Street and bought four pints of luscious looking organic strawberries for just $1.00 a pint! They were as good as they looked, as I just finished off a small bowl before sitting down to write this. </p>
<p>We were out for two hours and fifteen minutes and Amelia was asleep for all but fifteen of them! I'm always amazed at how happily she awakens... coming to the surface with a slow sweet smile and finally bursting into big smiles, lots of hand action and topping it off with a big wet raspberry, complete with a big satisfied grin for me. What a darling she is! </p>
<p>It was a fast walk through the park, with a slow stroll through the rose garden and then a meander around Stow Lake once again, where I was lucky enough to spot a heron sitting on a low branch overhanging the lake, with many ducks huddled against the high wind in that section of the park. By the time we were on our way home the sun was shining again and the wind had died down.</p>
<p>Before leaving Amelia today I watched her eat a very hardy and large portion of strained carrots followed by apricots with applesauce. This is a gal who likes to eat; the proof is in her cheeks!  </p>
<p>Potrero Hill was still sunny and warm when I pulled up at 7 p.m. after tea and biscuits with Susan and Kevin. A message from Bryn was waiting for me, saying that he and Riku were coming over for a little visit, to return a trolley to me for my laundry room. </p>
<p>Riku was smiling away at me from the back seat of the car when they pulled in and was very happy to have a little time to play up in my bedroom, with his blocks and, of course, his friend the mirror. </p>
<p>How lucky I am to have that little family just around a few corners from me! As I carried him down to the car, we spotted a huge flock of birds overhead which obviously thrilled him to bits... a bonus before leaving Nana's. How clever I was to have arranged the timing so well. </p>
<p>Bed time... night night.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/meeting_grandpa.html">Meeting Grandpa</a></h2>
								<p>Grandpa arrived home today from Houston at 10:15 a.m. and we had made arrangements to meet his plane and then spend some time with Riku on the Sky Train; the train travels between the various terminals, parking lots, auto rental facility and BART, our local train service. </p>
<p>The first exciting part of this adventure for Riku was the moving sidewalk, which obviously pleased him as he had a very large smile the whole time he was walking on it. It's one of the very smooth bouncy kind and I'm always tempted to run on them (and do when I'm the only one in the area). Then came the escalator; Riku stepped on and off three different sets, obviously proud of himself, and was very intrigued to see the stairs disappear. </p>
<p>Despite being more than ready for his nap, Riku was so excited waiting for Doug to show up. He would stretch his neck up and say "Bompa?, Bompa?". Finally Grandpa showed up and Riku immediately wanted him to carry him and hold him. </p>
<p>After waiting quite a while for Doug's bag to show up on the carousel, Doug and Riku went for a very long walk around the baggage claim areas, getting lots of attention with his big smiles. I took over at one point and we had another wander about, pointing out babies, and big girls and boys. He looked particularly fetching in his navy blue pullover and jeans this morning. </p>
<p>We managed to get seating at the front of the train, on the wide flat front portion with wonderful views of the tracks, the planes in the air and on the ground, lots of buses, cars, and of course people getting on and off the train. We rode it for forty-minutes, long enough that Riku had a snack of raisins and toast for extra stamina. He thoroughly enjoys those raisins! Doug and I both took lots of photos, so one day they will be up and posted for you to see. </p>
<p>He spent the rest of the day at home with Akane, until Doug and I picked him up at 5:15 p.m. for an hour of sandbox time at his local playground. It wasn't quite long enough for any of us, but we all had a little walk and some fresh air before Doug and I headed off to a movie, with a falafel sandwich for dinner beforehand. </p>
<p>The movie? "The Mother" which I was expecting to really enjoy and instead found myself not particularly liking any of the characters... very disappointing after the wonderful reviews I had read. However, I won the tickets, and it was a night out for us.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/amelia_time_and_a_visit_with_r.html">Amelia Time and a Visit with Riku</a></h2>
								<p>This morning our guest, Charles, arrived from Australia; he was with us for two days and they flew by. It was the first time I had met him and after Doug picked him up from his 10 a.m. flight we sat in the living room chatting for a couple of hours. Charles is a real people person and tells some great stories. Gotta love that Australian accent... </p>
<p>Then the day got busy! Susan and Kevin came by to drop some things off in storage while I held Amelia and had a bit of a visit with Susan. Meanwhile, my friend Maxine came by to pick up a few items for a garage sale, met Susan, Kevin, and Amelia for the first time, and introduced Amelia to her dog, Anya. Amelia was totally fascinated, leaning way over my arm to get a better look at Anya on the sidewalk below us; she is obviously her mother's child! </p>
<p>Doug and Charles went off to pick up some groceries and movie tickets for me, so Amelia and I snuck off for a nice long stroller ride thorugh the Mission District... not our usual long one, but enough for a fifty-five minute snooze for Amelia and a quick hello at Riku's house. </p>
<p>Riku may remember when Amelia pulled his hair three months ago so he didn't get too close to her, but she gave Akane a big smile in the kitchen, and them moved on to the living room to charm Uncle Bryn. They were both wearing stripes that day, and so made a very attractive couple; he "flew" her up in the air and down again, and she leaned against his legs, beaming her big smile his way, once again winning his heart. </p>
<p>I had started dinner in the late morning, but that was as far as it got, so Doug suggested dinner out (what a welcome idea that was!) and off we went to Marnee Thai for a most delicious dinner. It has been years since we have been there and it is as good as it always was; Charles liked it very much too and we were all ready for an early night when we got home.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/fathers_day.html">Father's Day</a></h2>
								<p>Another busy day from beginning to end. Bryn dropped in with three very fresh croissants and to wish his Dad a "Happy Father's Day". We all enjoyed the pastries (a rare treat in this house), with Judi Speirs homemade blackberry jam from last summer, and the last of the marmalade that Gail and Tom bought for Doug. </p>
<p>I volunteered to make the sandwiches for our picnic this afternoon so, after a morning chat with Doug and Charles, and while Bryn was picking up some of the extra supplies (four very long baquettes, etc.), I got busy making fillings and packing up the date squares I made yesterday. </p>
<p>We were quite a crowd... Charles, Garry, Lara, Susan, Kevin, Amelia, Akane, Bryn, Riku, Doug and I, all gathered at Stow Lake in Golden Gate Park at 2 p.m. to celebrate Father's Day... Doug's, Charles', Bryn's second one, and Kevin's first. </p>
<p>The 1361 Rhode Island Street crew arrived a little later, due to the slowness of the food staff (me!), but it was perhaps a good thing as everyone was <strong>very</strong> happy to see us and proclaimed the food delicious.</p>
<p>Susan and Kevin took along some lemonade and chocolate bars which was just what I needed to complete my lunch; I am going to try to remember that chocolate is a perfect dessert for a picnic, very portable and no prep time. Yum! It hit the spot for some reason... :)<br />
 </p>
<p>Riku sat on my lap during lunch, although he was more interested in the company than in the food that both his mom and I prepared for him, let Lara show me his newly acquired talent...  their "high fives" ..., sat in a boat aided and abetted by Grandpa until they were told this was not allowed!, wandered around looking at the ducks and birds and would have been very happy to walk right into the water. He loves a crowd of people, always, and so was a very happy little boy. Riku is going to be quite a party boy when he grows up... that's my prediction! </p>
<p>I had just a little snuggle with Amelia but then she nursed and went to sleep in her buggy, while Susan and Lara got to know each other, Garry and Charles talked about Australia, Kevin and Bryn caught up a bit on their lives, and Doug and I snapped lots of photos. </p>
<p>By the end of the two and a half hours we were all ready to head out and get on with our day... Susan and Kevin had shelves to put up, Bryn had work to do, Garry and Lara walked the Golden Gate Bridge, and Doug and Charles still had lots to talk about. </p>
<p>Riku was a tired boy and so I volunteered to walk him home (we had taken the stroller along with us, as I thought this might be the case) and off we trekked. It is a good long walk from Stow Lake to Hampshire Street; it would have taken about an hour fast walking but after a half hour I realized that Riku was in a deep sleep so I slowed right down and strolled home, stopping in to check out a garden bench on Haight Street, and meandering through the Castro District and the Mission on the way. Riku was still sleeping at the end of an hour and a quarter so I walked over to the hospital grounds, found a sunny spot to sit and read my book for a half hour. By this time it was after 7 p.m. and I was sure his Mommy and Daddy would be missing him, and so I slowly coaxed him awake, something I really don't enjoy doing at all. </p>
<p>All was quiet at his house so he and his Mom had a quiet bit of time together before Garry and Lara, and Sean and Mari arrived for the evening. </p>
<p>I finished off the dinner preparations and Charles, Doug and I sat down to a very tasty meal (as Doug and Charles told me) of cheese and mushroom canneloni and a big salad. </p>
<p>Kelly called at the end of the day to wish her Dad a "Happy Father's Day" and to let him know that her gift to him would be an hour or two boat rental at Stow Lake. Riku will certainly be invited along on this trip; he was so fascinated with seeing the boats today. </p>
<p>Charles gave me a <strong>big</strong> box of Joseph Schmidt chocolate truffles and I have that to look forward to all week and more... a perfect end to a perfect day...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/adorable_amelia.html">Adorable Amelia</a></h2>
								<p>Amelia and I set out for our park walk late this afternoon. It was a little windy which meant the trees were lively enough that Amelia stayed awake to watch. She doesn't want to miss out on a thing, this girl! I did the usual swaying stroller routine, hoping to coax her into a wee nap, but she wasn't having any of it. </p>
<p>I should have had the camera with me today as Amelia looked particularly darling in a flower embroidered soft blue jumper with white tights and shoes on to complete the outfit. Her big white brimmed hat completed the photo op... and there I was without one! </p>
<p>For the first time ever Amelia cried when I had her out, so thinking a burp was hiding I took her out at the children's playground for ten minutes of looking at the "big kids" on the swings. She won over another grandma there with her friendly smile and off we went again, wtih another fan in her world. </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin were hanging art work up when we arrived; the apartment looks like home more and more each day, and except for a dining room table I would say they are 97% there! </p>
<p>Amelia now has <em>six</em> teeth, four on top and two on the bottom, and her mom told me that she pulled herself up to a standing position this week! Ah, she's growing up already.  :)</p>
<p>I didn't expect to see Riku again today, but Bryn and I made a mad dash over to each others houses last night, expecting to meet somewhere in between but missing!, and so I ended up back at their place for some reading time with Riku. What a fine end to my day. Riku held up his arm while we were reading and pointing to the correct part said "elbow" very clearly; he was rewarded with a smile from his proud Nana...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/a_perfect_summer_day_with_riku.html">A Perfect Summer Day with Riku</a></h2>
								<p>Summer days mean lots of fresh fruit... organic strawberries and peaches are amongst Riku's favourite foods right now, and I had a winner when I combined tapioca pudding with the peaches today. He is a Dyment male for sure! </p>
<p>We had a typical morning/early afternoon here... a late breakfast, nap, back yard time with his big truck, and lunch. I had promised myself that the next sunny day with Riku would be an Ocean Beach day so off we went. He fell asleep on the way over, and suspecting that he might, I took along my book and read while he napped. </p>
<p>As soon as he woke he spotted the big waves (it was windier than I expected it to be) so off we went, not lasting long at playing in the sand... the wind just took the bubble liquid and pulled it out in hundreds of tiny bubbles!... so I let Riku meander at will. He truly loved walking on the sand, stooping to pick up rocks, feathers, tiny crab shells, and at one point a long dry piece of seaweed which blew along behind him as he stolled. It was a lovely hour and I took lots of pictures, reminding me of the days with wee Bryn at Ocean Beach when he was this age. </p>
<p>Back to Nana's house for some sitting-on-the-bed-time going through a tiny box that either his Auntie Kelly or his Daddy gave to me many many years ago. It holds a broken string of pearls which fascinates him, and two pairs of clip on earrings which he has me put on and then pulls off, saying "ouch". </p>
<p>The day ended later than usual with story time on the sofa and a couple of rounds of "ring around a rosy" whilst checking himself out in the mirror under the mantle. What a ham! as my Mom would have said. </p>
<p>p.s. Riku is missing his Grandpa. Both yesterday and today, each time he started to climb the stairs up to the main floor, he stopped and asked "Grandpa?"... and I had to tell him that no, his Grandpa wasn't home yet.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/zo_amelia_and_riku_and_doug_to.html">Zo&euml;, Amelia, and Riku ... and Doug too</a></h2>
								<p>Today Gail and Glenn celebrated their fifty-seventh birthday! Candy, Beth, and I all sang "Happy Birthday" to Gail on paltalk this morning, one at a time, but alas, Glenn missed out as he didn't join us today. </p>
<p>It was a bonus day today with a phone call from dear Zo&euml; in England. It has been far too long since our last phone call, and both of us have been neglecting email correspondence, due to our very hectic and busy social lives! We talked on her dime for a good while and then I called her back to continue catching up on all our news. What a perfect way to end the week. </p>
<p>I had my weekly chat with Bryn and Caillie  as well today. Bryn is sounding very grown up to me; I think his voice is deeper. He is a very good conversationalist and told me that the photo album, organized by Kelly as an end-of-the-year gift for his very special teacher, with accompanying letters and a photo of each pupil in the class, was a bit hit.  </p>
<p>Caillie sounds as chirpy and chipper as ever; Caillie doesn't like to spend much time on the phone, but is polite and answers a few questions before suggesting that I talk to someone else! However, she does like to be the last one on the phone; recently we have started counting backwards from a number which she chooses, ending with "I love you" and hanging up. </p>
<p>Amelia and I had a very nice long walk in the sunshine today... two and a half hours from 4:45 on. Before we left the house though she showed me how she can pull herself up to a standing position; she is as steady as can be and Susan tells me she can stand there for a good twenty minutes or so. As I was walking her the last ten minutes of our trip, I wiggled my fingers at her which made her smile and then reach out to touch my hand. We continued doing this for the rest of the trip home. I would reach out, grasp her hand and let go... and then she would reach out giving me the biggest smile when I interlinked our fingers. What a doll she is! </p>
<p>Susan sent me home with take-out Chinese food from our favourite vegetarian spot in Berkeley... a wonderful tofu and vegie dish and lemon "chicken"... yum! I didn't realize how hungry I was until I started heating it up! What a thoughtful and perfect thing to do, and that too was a wonderful way to end my week. </p>
<p>Bryn called to see if I would like to come over to say goodnight to a certain little boy. I did indeed, and we played with blocks in the kitchen, emptied out the plastics drawer and then "ceaned up" which I sing to him as he does so. Riku is very good at cleaning up after himself; what a good habit to begin so early and he enjoys it too. </p>
<p>I helped him brush his teeth with the new toothbrush and children's toothpaste that I bought him a couple of days ago. Oh, does he enjoy that! I helped get him into his pajamas and then walked home, awaiting the phone call from Doug to pick him up from BART... home from the last of his classes for the summer possibly. </p>
<p>Riku will be a happy boy tomorrow to see "Bompa".</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/an_afternoon_break_with_amelia.html">An Afternoon Break... with Amelia</a></h2>
								<p>After a fairly mundane Monday doing household chores -- laundry and vacuuming -- it was time for a walk. Amelia was game too, so at 3:50 p.m. we left her house; at 4 p.m. she was sound asleep, and remained so for two solid hours! </p>
<p>Her mom told me she had a two-hour nap in the car this morning as well (Susan got in some unexpected reading time) so she is a well rested girl today. Sleeping is not Amelia's favourite way to pass the time these days.</p>
<p>It was very breezy and cooler on the other side of the city, but we did what is quickly becoming "our walk": to Stow Lake and back, a good long walk indeed. Today I sat for ten minutes on a bench overlooking the lake, hoping to see one of the six great blue herons, two adults and four babies, nesting there, but to no avail. They may have been napping too.</p>
<p>The fog was rolling in on the far side of the lake and it was so thick it looked like smoke, and then disappeared on the breeze... lovely!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/riku_time.html">Riku Time</a></h2>
								<p>Riku arrived nice and early this morning, which was great, as it gave him time to explore all his favourite spots in the house before his second breakfast and morning naptime. We went upstairs together and I dug out some well-buried toys. Riku was delighted with a new-to-him tin plane, a tiny bear from way back in his Dad's and Auntie Kelly's childhoods, and a boy doll named Robin. Robin was bought when Kelly was expecting a new sibling to join our family, and it was a boy doll just in case she had a brother... which she did! Riku is quite taken with him; they have the same parts... very interesting for Riku. </p>
<p>Grandpa had installed a new program on the computer for Riku, called BabyType, which Riku was just delighted to see. He already knows that each push of the slash key will give him a rumbling truck noise, along with a picture of a truck. The space bar produces a big coloured ball, and lots of noise; his other favourites are a car and a key, with a revving engine noise. A half hour of this a day will do just fine as there are many other things on his nineteen-month-old agenda! </p>
<p>New word today... "vacuum"... and he also pointed out which clothes belonged to whom as I was ironing. It was another gorgeous day here so Riku spent some time playing in the yard on his own, but mostly wanted Grandpa to pay lots of attention to him. He was happy to have me sit with him while we ate together, and put him down for his two naps, but in between he wanted his Grandpa to pick him "up, up" whenever there was a little break between other activities. </p>
<p>Last week I allowed Riku to pluck away at the (Chinese) "moon instrument" hanging on the wall of the living room, as well as a mandolin that originally belonged to Doug's grandfather. Today he wanted Doug to show them to him, and was as pleased as could be to be sitting on "Bompa's" knee strumming away. </p>
<p>We all went off for a walk, hoping Riku would nap a bit, said goodbye to Doug at the BART station an hour and a half later (no nap), and then Riku and I spent an hour in the playground. He loves being up in the playhouse now, although it's a little nervewracking for me as there are two places he could fall from too high a height! </p>
<p>Home for a quick splash in the tub and off he went home with his Daddy to see Mommy. We had a great day.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/06/amelia_on_potrero_hill.html">Amelia on Potrero Hill</a></h2>
								<p>Susan booked a well-deserved massage and bath at the Kabuki Hot Springs for noon today, and so Amelia was delivered to us here at 10 a.m. What a treat! After a little nursing time Susan left us; it was plain that Amelia needed a long nap, so off we went in the stroller, all the way through the Mission District on the quieter streets and up to the very top of Noe Valley. </p>
<p>Amelia napped for just one hour although it was obvious she needed more. However, if there is anything at all going on, Amelia is determined not to miss out on it, so what with random motorcycle noises, and petitioners against Bush chatting us up, Amelia decided to just stay awake for the rest of the trip. </p>
<p>We walked for two and a half hours and by then it was lunch time for Amelia... squash, followed by her favourite applesauce. It was such fun to feed her, as she was ready for it; she looked so cute sitting in Riku's chair at the table. She is strong enough that she can push her hands against the table and get the front legs of the chair off the floor! </p>
<p>After that it was play time (and photo time too!)... in the living room on the sofa with Raggedy Andy, standing up against the sofa, and in Riku's room, sitting and/or rolling on the bed. Grandpa also showed her some interesting designs on the computer and walked her around the house showing her the same things that interested Riku at this age... the big clock, the chimes on the counter, and all the various folk art chickens.</p>
<p>Finished the day off with a chat on the phone with Riku, promising him a train trip tomorrow. He didn't say much, but Bryn said he was listening intently, and so we are off tomorrow on a 10:14 a.m. train trip to Palo Alto.</p>
