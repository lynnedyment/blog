								<h2>Father's Day</h2>
								<p>Another busy day from beginning to end. Bryn dropped in with three very fresh croissants and to wish his Dad a "Happy Father's Day". We all enjoyed the pastries (a rare treat in this house), with Judi Speirs homemade blackberry jam from last summer, and the last of the marmalade that Gail and Tom bought for Doug. </p>
<p>I volunteered to make the sandwiches for our picnic this afternoon so, after a morning chat with Doug and Charles, and while Bryn was picking up some of the extra supplies (four very long baquettes, etc.), I got busy making fillings and packing up the date squares I made yesterday. </p>
<p>We were quite a crowd... Charles, Garry, Lara, Susan, Kevin, Amelia, Akane, Bryn, Riku, Doug and I, all gathered at Stow Lake in Golden Gate Park at 2 p.m. to celebrate Father's Day... Doug's, Charles', Bryn's second one, and Kevin's first. </p>
<p>The 1361 Rhode Island Street crew arrived a little later, due to the slowness of the food staff (me!), but it was perhaps a good thing as everyone was <strong>very</strong> happy to see us and proclaimed the food delicious.</p>
<p>Susan and Kevin took along some lemonade and chocolate bars which was just what I needed to complete my lunch; I am going to try to remember that chocolate is a perfect dessert for a picnic, very portable and no prep time. Yum! It hit the spot for some reason... :)<br />
 </p>
<p>Riku sat on my lap during lunch, although he was more interested in the company than in the food that both his mom and I prepared for him, let Lara show me his newly acquired talent...  their "high fives" ..., sat in a boat aided and abetted by Grandpa until they were told this was not allowed!, wandered around looking at the ducks and birds and would have been very happy to walk right into the water. He loves a crowd of people, always, and so was a very happy little boy. Riku is going to be quite a party boy when he grows up... that's my prediction! </p>
<p>I had just a little snuggle with Amelia but then she nursed and went to sleep in her buggy, while Susan and Lara got to know each other, Garry and Charles talked about Australia, Kevin and Bryn caught up a bit on their lives, and Doug and I snapped lots of photos. </p>
<p>By the end of the two and a half hours we were all ready to head out and get on with our day... Susan and Kevin had shelves to put up, Bryn had work to do, Garry and Lara walked the Golden Gate Bridge, and Doug and Charles still had lots to talk about. </p>
<p>Riku was a tired boy and so I volunteered to walk him home (we had taken the stroller along with us, as I thought this might be the case) and off we trekked. It is a good long walk from Stow Lake to Hampshire Street; it would have taken about an hour fast walking but after a half hour I realized that Riku was in a deep sleep so I slowed right down and strolled home, stopping in to check out a garden bench on Haight Street, and meandering through the Castro District and the Mission on the way. Riku was still sleeping at the end of an hour and a quarter so I walked over to the hospital grounds, found a sunny spot to sit and read my book for a half hour. By this time it was after 7 p.m. and I was sure his Mommy and Daddy would be missing him, and so I slowly coaxed him awake, something I really don't enjoy doing at all. </p>
<p>All was quiet at his house so he and his Mom had a quiet bit of time together before Garry and Lara, and Sean and Mari arrived for the evening. </p>
<p>I finished off the dinner preparations and Charles, Doug and I sat down to a very tasty meal (as Doug and Charles told me) of cheese and mushroom canneloni and a big salad. </p>
<p>Kelly called at the end of the day to wish her Dad a "Happy Father's Day" and to let him know that her gift to him would be an hour or two boat rental at Stow Lake. Riku will certainly be invited along on this trip; he was so fascinated with seeing the boats today. </p>
<p>Charles gave me a <strong>big</strong> box of Joseph Schmidt chocolate truffles and I have that to look forward to all week and more... a perfect end to a perfect day...</p>
