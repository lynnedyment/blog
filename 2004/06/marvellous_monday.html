								<h2>Marvellous Monday</h2>
								<p>Why marvellous? Because today I saw both Riku <strong>and</strong> Amelia, a bonus day for sure! Akane and I went off this morning with Riku, to the doctor, for his eighteen month check-up. Riku had a wonderful time in the office playing with big stacking blocks and various stuffed animals, including Snoopy, whom he gave a big hug. Next time I shall take my camera along; photo opportunity missed for sure. While waiting for the doctor to arrive in the examination room Riku took the car key, slid it underneath the door and then turned to look at us, shrugging his shoulders as if to say he had no idea what happened to it, and then gave us a big grin when we opened the door for him to "discover" it... over and over. Riku is doing very well, his chart lines are just where they should be, and the doctor was very pleased with his overall health. The stats tell us he is a smallish boy with a big head... 25th percentile for height, 15 for weight, and 95 for head circumference! He had his second polio shot and since Akane nursed him through this one it was less traumatic for him; he cried only seconds and then took comfort in his mom's arms. Luckily Riku has never had a reaction to any of his shots so once the deed is done that's the end of it. </p>
<p>It was a long wait from beginning to end, and we were all hungry when the appointment was over, so off we went for lunch out, a rare event for the three of us. Riku happily sat in a high chair eating his fresh tomatoes and tortellini packed lunch, while Akane and I had a sandwich each. Next stop was at Rainbow Groceries where Riku takes such pleasure in walking on his own up and down whatever aisle catches his interest, smiling and waving at friendly shoppers, stopping to arrange a set of boxes of tea or whatever, (but always putting them back in place), helping the man at the produce section by relieving him of the plastic inserts for the fresh peaches, and being just delighted when spotting his mommy in one of his sojourns throughout the big store. I walk a few respectable steps behind him during this adventure to give him some freedom. He knows I'm there and turns to smile at me occasionally, continuing on to the next adventure. </p>
<p>An hour after arriving home, and after a fortifying cup of hot tea, I drove off to Ashbury Street to pick up the girl who gives me the <strong>biggest</strong> smiles in the world! We set off for a long walk, through the Panhandle, into Golden Gate Park with all the new groupings of young hippies, around the beautifully restored carousel (which she went on for the first time last week with her Mom), back up Haight Street and then several trips up and down the Panhandle as the sun was setting. </p>
<p>Amelia held off napping for 75 minutes and then dropped into a very deep sleep. I think I could have walked her through 'til 10 p.m. but thought her parents might worry about her being out so late!.. so the minute she opened her big blue eyes just a little I spoke to her, she slowly came to, and off we went home at 8:30. </p>
<p>Susan told me last night that Amelia was a very happy girl in her bath that night and had a very good night's sleep, despite our concern that she would be wide awake due to that late nap. I slept well myself... :)</p>
