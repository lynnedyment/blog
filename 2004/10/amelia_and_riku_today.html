								<h2>Amelia and Riku today...</h2>
								<p>What a lovely day this turned out to be; I had both children with me for different parts of the day, which is a rare treat. Assuming that Akane and Riku would be sleeping during the morning, I called Susan to see if Amelia would like a morning walk with me... a perfect opportunity, as usually I see Amelia in the late afternoons. </p>
<p>Happily, this worked out for them too, so Susan dropped Amelia off for me at 10:30 and we set off for what became a three hour walk. Amelia stayed awake for the first hour (even when she was almost asleep, the second she spotted a bird that little hand went up to make the sign for "bird") and so it made sense to walk her until she finally gave in and slept. It was a great long walk for me, although it was hot enough that I walked on the shady side of all the streets we travelled today. </p>
<p>I had just pushed the stroller into the driveway when Susan pulled up(mother's intuition!), so Susan came up while Amelia had a "snack", and what a snack it was! Hmm, homemade macaroni and cheese, cubes of avocado, yogurt, peaches... the food kept coming and Amelia kept eating. Susan says she often will not eat much for a day or two and then seems to make up for it; today was one of those days for sure! </p>
<p>It was a lovely afternoon, as Susan was in no rush to leave. We had lunch together and I managed to get some video taping done of Amelia (and a bit with her mom too). I really wanted to tape Amelia climbing up and down the stairs, as she is really proficient at it, but of course the minute the tape was running Amelia found other things of interest to keep her busy. </p>
<p>She is such a darling little girl; she turns around to give me a big smile when she pauses for a minute and I get nice little cuddles too.</p>
<p>Amelia is very clear with her "Mama" and "Papa"; I think that "Nana" can't be far off. :)</p>
<p>Amelia took four steps today in the house and it won't be long before she is walking, although she does love to hold on to us with just one hand and move along a little faster. This is a girl on the move!  </p>
<p>The timing for a visit with Riku was perfect as, at 3:30 p.m., just as Susan decided they should be heading for home, Akane called to say Riku was awake and had just eaten. Susan dropped me off there on her way home, and Riku and I headed off to Parque Ninos Unidos, the local playground just a few blocks away from his house. </p>
<p>How he has changed in six weeks! No longer is he content to spend most of his time in the sandbox... not when there are ladders leading up to the rope dome!, and another up to the playhouse. Before this, Riku would climb up steps to the house but now he decided it was time to tackle the very steep ladder. He really stuggles to get his little legs up and his foot onto the rungs, even though they are quite a reach for him. </p>
<p>Oh, he was the only child in the little room just off the playground, and spent quite a long time in there, putting balls into the basketball hoop and drawing on a huge sheet of paper with pencil crayons. I was happy to be out of the hot sun; there are not many shady areas in that particular park. </p>
<p>Riku likes to explore there on his own and especially enjoys being chased around the grassed area. It was such fun being with him again.</p>
<p>His Daddy was going to be home for dinner at 6 p.m., before heading back to work, so Riku walked all the way home to be greeted by his very enthusiastic daddy.</p>
