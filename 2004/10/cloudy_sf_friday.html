								<h2>Cloudy SF Friday</h2>
								<p>It was a pleasure to wake up this morning to a heavy cloud cover over the hills opposite us. It was supposed to have cleared by noon, but this didn't happen. After all the heat of last week this was just fine with me. Susan, Kevin, and Amelia pulled up at 9 a.m. for the drive to the airport; what a treat to sit in the back seat with Amelia as she puckered up for kisses and strained backwards to get Doug to pay attention to her from the front seat. They are off to rainy Vancouver for Steve and Jen's wedding and will return on Sunday night. </p>
<p>Doug and I drove to the produce market for a box of both oranges and grapefruit, before returning home. Because of the floods and hurricanes in Florida prices are higher than ever, but still cheaper there than at the local stores. I have missed having my fruit bowl each day and it's time to get back on track. </p>
<p>Riku and I walked from his house to ours at 11 a.m. and there was a little glimmer of sunshine, but that was it for the day. However, Riku was more than happy to play for an hour and a half in the garden, watering all my plants with a small measuring cup and transferring the water from one container to another three. After a big bowl of grainy cereal and half a fresh peach, he was ready for a nap. He slept for almost two hours and still seemed tired when he awoke. </p>
<p>While he was napping I spoke with Gail, who is in a lot of upper chest pain from her probe yesterday. She was walking the floor and sounded horrible. Poor kid; tomorrow has to be better. </p>
<p>Riku and I had just a half hour left together before leaving for his house, so I popped him into a warm tub with his alphabet letters and Robin, the doll. Robin has to have his hair washed before Riku; it makes hair washing easier. </p>
<p>Akane nursed Riku while Doug put in the car seat and the luggage, and at 4:15 we picked Bryn up from work for the trip to the airport. Saying goodbye for just two days is not at all difficult, although I do wish I were going too! </p>
<p>Doug and I had a quiet evening at home, catching up on some emails after dinner, and then watching a rented video ("Before Sunrise") and some taped shows, which are ever-growing in number.</p>
