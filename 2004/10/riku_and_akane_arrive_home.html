								<h2>Riku and Akane arrive home!</h2>
								<p>Well, we have been counting down the days and at last it arrived. At 9 a.m. the plane from Japan touched down in San Francisco, carrying two very tired and loved people in our lives. </p>
<p>Bryn picked them up and had gifts waiting for them both at home, replacement favourite tea cups for Akane, and a big set of fire house paraphernalia for Riku... ladder trucks, firemen, a fire station, etc. Riku was only too delighted to show it all to me when I arrived just after 10 a.m. to see them. He had also pulled all of his block sets out and they were spread all over the floor. Riku was very busy trying to do and see everything at once, but eventually slowed down enough to eat some breakfast. </p>
<p>While I was cooking his breakfast though, Riku decided that the toilet needed cleaning (even though his dad had done a thorough job yesterday), so took both his and his mom's toothbrush to bring it up to his own standards! Riku very very rarely has played in the toilet water so we were very surprised to find him happily cleaning away. </p>
<p>Riku walked back to my house with me, stopping to pick up dozens of leaves and finding interesting places to put them... into any little hole he spotted, and tucking them through the picket fence at the corner of the next block. At the very last block, he realized how tired he was and asked to be picked up. </p>
<p>Back at Nana's house, he would try out some Japanese phrases on me, and then switch to English when it was obvious that I didn't have a clue what he was saying! His language skills, including English, have improved so much, even though he has heard nothing but Japanese for the past six weeks. Now when I give him a word it just comes right out of his mouth, correctly, and with no hesitation. It's amazing to hear the changes that have taken place. </p>
<p>The cutest thing happened today; I was singing the ABC song to him, over and over, while we were in the kitchen together and after I had stopped I heard Riku saying in a singsong voice... "w, x and y". </p>
<p>Of course he was delighted to be here, amongst his familiar possessions; he immediately headed into his room to pull out his tin box of cars. Bryn and Bryant donated many more to him during one of their 27 flings, and now the box is full... too heavy for Riku to carry on his own. He emptied it all out onto the kitchen rug and sat happily for twenty minutes investigating all the new ones and rediscovering the old ones. Riku really loves doors or trunks that open and tries each new one for this feature. </p>
<p>I had intended taking him out for a walk, hoping he would nap for a couple of hours, but it was so obvious that he was ready for his nap NOW that I tucked him in with his monkey, two dogs, and two mice. In less than five minutes he was sound asleep and stayed asleep for four hours! </p>
<p>I fed him a big late lunch of pasta and applesauce, and a fresh homemade oatmeal/cranberry cookie, and then we went off for a walk to Rainbow Grocers with Akane. Riku loves having the run of this store, so stopped to explore everything new that caught his eye, and remembered where the free cheese samples are! He also likes the olive samples, also served on toothpicks, and enjoys putting the toothpicks into the special little diposal bins when he is finished. There were lots of smiles directed at this little guy meandering happily around the store. Riku is the friendliest little person I have ever known; everyone gets a big smile from him, even those who haven't even noticed him.  </p>
<p>Bryn came to the store just before 8 p.m. to pick us up, and Riku was just delighted to see him, wanting to know each time he couldn't spot his Dad to know where he was. He repeated over and over "Mommy!", "Daddy!" and "Nana!". pointing to all of us in turn. </p>
<p>We all went "Papalote" for Mexican food, which Akane was happy to indulge in again. Riku was buzzing around, ate his dinner, and then it soon became obvious that he was winding down once again and needed his bed, as did his mommy. I was back home just before 9 p.m.</p>
<p>Grandpa left for Texas earlier this morning and will be home late tomorrow night, so Riku will have one more exciting day on Thursday.</p>
