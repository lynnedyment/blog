								<h2>It's the End of the Week!</h2>
								<p>This morning I was feeling as though I were in a fog, and not walking through it as usual. I tried to nap on the sofa around noon, but I am just not a good napper. I managed to find enough energy to finish off the ironing, so I could get rid of the board from the bedroom in anticipation of the weekend. </p>
<p>What I really needed was a long walk but the day just didn't work out that way. Doug went off with the car on his own to run some errands and I was anticipating Celeste and Steve being here early for our planned dinner out, to Lu Lai, a spot that Doug, Celeste, and I are very fond of... it's our very favourite Chinese vegetarian food in the Bay area... so no walk today. </p>
<p>Doug spent lots of time today putting my photos from Ontario in an online album for me, and sorting out the photos of Amelia into her online album as well. I have an order waiting to go in and can't wait to get started on getting these latest photos into real albums. Next week is photo week! </p>
<p>Celeste, Steve, Judy (a gal from their class), Doug, and I headed to Milpitas for dinner about 7 p.m. Making menu choices at this restaurant is really tough but we decided on won ton soup, two orders of lemon duck (Doug, Celeste's and my very favourite dish here), twice-cooked tofu, "beef" and broccoli, and grilled mushrooms with basil on scewers for an appetizer... and of course rice and Chinese tea. There were lots of happy eating sounds at the table, even from the non-vegetarians.</p>
<p>After dinner we dropped Judy at home, who introduced her husband and friends out working on mini-racing cars for a race tomorrow. Their children, 16 and 13, drive them, and they are really cool looking little cars. </p>
<p>Following that we had a tour of their newly renovated house; Doug fell in love with the shower in the master bedroom, and I thought the two dishwashers in the new kitchen was just a great idea of her husband's. </p>
<p>With Celeste here, no day is complete without ice cream at the end of the day but tonight, since everyone had decided to try the in-season peach ice cream, we just bought a half gallon and came home to indulge. </p>
<p>Bed time at 11:15 p.m. full and happy, and with only three more days until that plane touches down!</p>
