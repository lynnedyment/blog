								<h2><a href="/2004/10/monday_back_in_the_park.html">Monday... back in the Park</a></h2>
								<p>This morning was a busy day, running errands in the morning with Doug, starting the laundry, and ending with a hair cut in Noe Valley. And then it was time to get back to my walking routine with Amelia, and what better place to start than in Golden Gate Park, our old haunt. Amelia was at the door to greet me with her big smiles, standing proudly (she took three steps when I was away!), and happy to see me. The feeling was certainly mutual, and off we went for a stroll to Stow Lake and back again, a two and a half hour trip in all. </p>
<p>Unfortunately Amelia's nap was interrupted by a young boy shouting into her carriage when she was in a deep sleep and that was it, no more naptime for her. Instead, I was treated to lots of finger pointing and connecting time, and best of all, lots of big puckers-up for kisses all the way home. Amelia also waves with great vigour from side to side, which is just adorable. It's good to be home and back on track with long walks. The air smells just wonderful! </p>
<p>Drove Doug to the Oakland airport at 8 p.m for his three day trip to Virginia. </p>
<p>Riku and Akane will be home in just one week... counting down the days now.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/at_home_with_amelia.html">At Home with Amelia</a></h2>
								<p>Back to the laundry today; lots to do, but it helped knowing that Amelia would join me at home today. Susan had some errands in this part of town to run, so she dropped Amelia off for me, about 12:15. We spent about forty-five minutes just hanging about with Amelia playing in the living room with the chickens, in the kitchen pulling out the plastics from the drawer, rediscovering the basket of toys in the kitchen, and "cruising" whilst holding on to the walls, sofa, and chairs. </p>
<p>After that we headed out for a very long walk through the Mission District. Amelia sat up so nicely in our stroller and enjoyed eating snacks from the little tray (raisins and biscuits. After that, Amelia was asleep almost instantly and slept for a full two hours, enjoying more snacks and water when she woke up. I took advantage of her well- rested and well-fed little self and did some videotaping of her. What a wonderful age this is! </p>
<p>After such a late night last night, I planned on an early night tonight, but stayed up later than anticipated trying to catch up on emails. </p>
<p>Six more days 'til Riku and Akane fly in!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/expecting_company.html">Expecting Company</a></h2>
								<p>Busy day today as I was expecting Celeste and her friend Steve in at some point. I did work on a photo album for a couple of hours before deciding that I really did have to clean the bathroom, do a few little jobs in the guest room and a quick vacuuming. I was hoping to get out for a walk with Amelia as it was a gorgeous day, but didn't hear from Celeste until later than I anticipated. I was hoping to spend some time every day this week with her. </p>
<p>Celeste and Steve arrived about 4:30 and we sat and chatted in the living room for quite a while; Celeste was starving but Bryn decided he would like to join us for dinner, so we met him at the Roosevelt Tamale Parlour at 6 p.m. </p>
<p>It has been a long time since Celeste and Bryn have seen each other and we all had a long leisurely and most delicious meal together. Bryn tried my favourite dish there, chili rellenos, and really liked it, and he and Steve shared two plates of the same and cheese and chicken enchiladas. Yum! </p>
<p>Celeste had been anticipating Mitchell's ice cream for dessert, as she used to go to this 1954 ice cream parlour when she was a little girl living in the city. So off we went; as usual the place was busy as it always is, and Bryn had purple yam ice cream while Celeste and Steve both had Mexican chocolate covered with chocolate sauce. I abstained... just too comfortable and happy after my chili relleno. </p>
<p>Back home for a bit of chatting but we were all more than ready for bed at 10:15, after a busy day for everyone. </p>
<p>Five days to go, and counting...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/thursday_foggy_thursday.html">Thursday, Foggy Thursday</a></h2>
								<p>Celeste and Steve left for their course at 7:45 a.m., and I had some PalTalk time with Gail, Candy, and Glenn, before heading upstairs to get started at the backload of ironing... twenty plus shirts! Arggh! </p>
<p>Doug had taped Oprah for me while I was away so I took the ironing board upstairs and settled in for a few hours of pressing time. Watching tv certainly makes ironing more pleasant for me and before I knew it I had only seven pieces to go to the end of the pile. However, I really needed a break and some air, and Amelia was ready for a nap. We do make a good team! </p>
<p>I had an adventure along the way though... a flat tire in the Mission District, so after a few phone calls and then a lucky turn with two good Samaritans, who changed the tire for me, I drove to Larkin tires, had it repaired and finally, at 5 p.m. managed to get to Fell Street. </p>
<p>Amelia was asleep before we hit the end of the Panhandle and slept for a full hour and a half walk through the park in the fog. It was really beautiful, and not chilly once I got up to speed. Susan had kindly made me a thermos of really hot tea, which hit the spot perfectly. </p>
<p>The light was so wonderful that I stopped and took a lot of photos... of two new hearts I hadn't photographed yet (but had intended to), of the lake with some trees in their fall colours surrounding it, and of course of Amelia, one of my favourite subjects. </p>
<p>When she awoke, we had a lovely half hour together with Amelia pointing to the trees, stretching up to see the dogs going by, and making her noise and mouth action for fish. I didn't see any, but Amelia may just be much more observant than I am. </p>
<p>I had promised Bryn some time in the apartment with him, so off I went to Hampshire Street at 7:30 p.m. First came dinner, and we walked around the corner to a little Mexican place which specializes in quesadillas; we each had plain quesadillas with black beans, served with small amounts of sour cream, salsa, and guacamole... just delicious! I will have it again soon, with Doug... a good plate to share if one isn't too hungry. </p>
<p>Back at the apartment, I sorted out a bookcase, and did a little dusting in anticipation of just four more days of waiting for Akane and Riku. There were some new books for Riku's shelves while Bryn organized the new shelves that he had installed in the storage room off the kitchen. </p>
<p>Somehow I managed to stay awake long enough to drive to Oakland to meet Doug coming in at 12:20 a.m. tomorrow!!! One tired woman crawled into bed tonight...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/its_the_end_of_the_week.html">It's the End of the Week!</a></h2>
								<p>This morning I was feeling as though I were in a fog, and not walking through it as usual. I tried to nap on the sofa around noon, but I am just not a good napper. I managed to find enough energy to finish off the ironing, so I could get rid of the board from the bedroom in anticipation of the weekend. </p>
<p>What I really needed was a long walk but the day just didn't work out that way. Doug went off with the car on his own to run some errands and I was anticipating Celeste and Steve being here early for our planned dinner out, to Lu Lai, a spot that Doug, Celeste, and I are very fond of... it's our very favourite Chinese vegetarian food in the Bay area... so no walk today. </p>
<p>Doug spent lots of time today putting my photos from Ontario in an online album for me, and sorting out the photos of Amelia into her online album as well. I have an order waiting to go in and can't wait to get started on getting these latest photos into real albums. Next week is photo week! </p>
<p>Celeste, Steve, Judy (a gal from their class), Doug, and I headed to Milpitas for dinner about 7 p.m. Making menu choices at this restaurant is really tough but we decided on won ton soup, two orders of lemon duck (Doug, Celeste's and my very favourite dish here), twice-cooked tofu, "beef" and broccoli, and grilled mushrooms with basil on scewers for an appetizer... and of course rice and Chinese tea. There were lots of happy eating sounds at the table, even from the non-vegetarians.</p>
<p>After dinner we dropped Judy at home, who introduced her husband and friends out working on mini-racing cars for a race tomorrow. Their children, 16 and 13, drive them, and they are really cool looking little cars. </p>
<p>Following that we had a tour of their newly renovated house; Doug fell in love with the shower in the master bedroom, and I thought the two dishwashers in the new kitchen was just a great idea of her husband's. </p>
<p>With Celeste here, no day is complete without ice cream at the end of the day but tonight, since everyone had decided to try the in-season peach ice cream, we just bought a half gallon and came home to indulge. </p>
<p>Bed time at 11:15 p.m. full and happy, and with only three more days until that plane touches down!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/quiet_sunday.html">Quiet Sunday</a></h2>
								<p>Today was a very low-key quiet day for me. Doug and Bryn went off to IKEA and Berkeley while I stayed home and caught up on some paper work and loose ends. When they returned, Doug drove to San Mateo to attend a adventure/travel show, where the bag he helped designed was being introduced, while Bryn and I went to Costco and on a vacuum cleaner search for him. From there we drove to Noe Valley on a search for a baby doll for Amelia, and then on to West Portal when I had no luck either. I settled for a tiny tub doll, not exactly what I wanted, so I will continue the search and make it a Christmas gift. </p>
<p>Bryn stopped for a submarine sandwich for his dinner before dropping me off at home. Doug and I had a quick and easy dinner and watched a few videos before calling it a day. </p>
<p>I spoke with Riku on the phone tonight for a few minutes; he was listening, but unlike the other day I didn't get a giggle out of him this time. I did tell him however that he would be home very soon, just one and a half days to go!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/happy_birthday_amelia.html">Happy Birthday Amelia!</a></h2>
								<p>Amelia turned one today. It hardly seems possible that an entire year has flown by and now we have a "walking, talking, little doll", making us all smile at her antics, and marvelling at her skills... making the signs for birds, monkeys, and dogs, puckering up for big kisses (and making sure she collects them), pointing that little finger at every single thing that she spots which amuses her, taking those first few steps, climbing up and down stairs with vigour! and speed, and basically stealing our hearts. </p>
<p>Many friends gathered today to celebrate Amelia; invitations were sent out two weeks ago and over thirty of us were at Ashbury Street to wish Amelia "Happy Birthday". She was a vision in pink velvet, with carousels embroidered along the hemline and was the perfect little hostess, making sure that each one of us had our share of her attention and big smiles. </p>
<p>Her parents had decorated the apartment with lots of pink balloons, and the theme was monkeys, one of Amelia's favourite creatures. A huge blow-up monkey stood at the end of the hall, along with a smaller one standing alongside. The table was decorated with some of her favourite little stuffed monkeys and the most amazing centrepiece were two cheesecakes, made by Susan, with Curious George's face done in FRUIT, arranged on top! Yes, we were all very impressed, and the cake was delicious as well. What a treat! </p>
<p>There was a very special guest of honour there today to help Amelia celebrate... her grandmother, Kevin's mom, flew in from Alaska for the occasion, and it was fun to hear how many things Amelia does that remind her of Kevin at the same age. </p>
<p>After two hours of being very socialable, Amelia was ready for a nap. She and I snuck out for a quiet two hour stroll in the park; Amelia slept for just over an hour and a half, and went home to all her presents and some time with Susan, Kevin, and Grandma after a very exciting day.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/riku_and_akane_arrive_home.html">Riku and Akane arrive home!</a></h2>
								<p>Well, we have been counting down the days and at last it arrived. At 9 a.m. the plane from Japan touched down in San Francisco, carrying two very tired and loved people in our lives. </p>
<p>Bryn picked them up and had gifts waiting for them both at home, replacement favourite tea cups for Akane, and a big set of fire house paraphernalia for Riku... ladder trucks, firemen, a fire station, etc. Riku was only too delighted to show it all to me when I arrived just after 10 a.m. to see them. He had also pulled all of his block sets out and they were spread all over the floor. Riku was very busy trying to do and see everything at once, but eventually slowed down enough to eat some breakfast. </p>
<p>While I was cooking his breakfast though, Riku decided that the toilet needed cleaning (even though his dad had done a thorough job yesterday), so took both his and his mom's toothbrush to bring it up to his own standards! Riku very very rarely has played in the toilet water so we were very surprised to find him happily cleaning away. </p>
<p>Riku walked back to my house with me, stopping to pick up dozens of leaves and finding interesting places to put them... into any little hole he spotted, and tucking them through the picket fence at the corner of the next block. At the very last block, he realized how tired he was and asked to be picked up. </p>
<p>Back at Nana's house, he would try out some Japanese phrases on me, and then switch to English when it was obvious that I didn't have a clue what he was saying! His language skills, including English, have improved so much, even though he has heard nothing but Japanese for the past six weeks. Now when I give him a word it just comes right out of his mouth, correctly, and with no hesitation. It's amazing to hear the changes that have taken place. </p>
<p>The cutest thing happened today; I was singing the ABC song to him, over and over, while we were in the kitchen together and after I had stopped I heard Riku saying in a singsong voice... "w, x and y". </p>
<p>Of course he was delighted to be here, amongst his familiar possessions; he immediately headed into his room to pull out his tin box of cars. Bryn and Bryant donated many more to him during one of their 27 flings, and now the box is full... too heavy for Riku to carry on his own. He emptied it all out onto the kitchen rug and sat happily for twenty minutes investigating all the new ones and rediscovering the old ones. Riku really loves doors or trunks that open and tries each new one for this feature. </p>
<p>I had intended taking him out for a walk, hoping he would nap for a couple of hours, but it was so obvious that he was ready for his nap NOW that I tucked him in with his monkey, two dogs, and two mice. In less than five minutes he was sound asleep and stayed asleep for four hours! </p>
<p>I fed him a big late lunch of pasta and applesauce, and a fresh homemade oatmeal/cranberry cookie, and then we went off for a walk to Rainbow Grocers with Akane. Riku loves having the run of this store, so stopped to explore everything new that caught his eye, and remembered where the free cheese samples are! He also likes the olive samples, also served on toothpicks, and enjoys putting the toothpicks into the special little diposal bins when he is finished. There were lots of smiles directed at this little guy meandering happily around the store. Riku is the friendliest little person I have ever known; everyone gets a big smile from him, even those who haven't even noticed him.  </p>
<p>Bryn came to the store just before 8 p.m. to pick us up, and Riku was just delighted to see him, wanting to know each time he couldn't spot his Dad to know where he was. He repeated over and over "Mommy!", "Daddy!" and "Nana!". pointing to all of us in turn. </p>
<p>We all went "Papalote" for Mexican food, which Akane was happy to indulge in again. Riku was buzzing around, ate his dinner, and then it soon became obvious that he was winding down once again and needed his bed, as did his mommy. I was back home just before 9 p.m.</p>
<p>Grandpa left for Texas earlier this morning and will be home late tomorrow night, so Riku will have one more exciting day on Thursday.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/amelia_and_riku_today.html">Amelia and Riku today...</a></h2>
								<p>What a lovely day this turned out to be; I had both children with me for different parts of the day, which is a rare treat. Assuming that Akane and Riku would be sleeping during the morning, I called Susan to see if Amelia would like a morning walk with me... a perfect opportunity, as usually I see Amelia in the late afternoons. </p>
<p>Happily, this worked out for them too, so Susan dropped Amelia off for me at 10:30 and we set off for what became a three hour walk. Amelia stayed awake for the first hour (even when she was almost asleep, the second she spotted a bird that little hand went up to make the sign for "bird") and so it made sense to walk her until she finally gave in and slept. It was a great long walk for me, although it was hot enough that I walked on the shady side of all the streets we travelled today. </p>
<p>I had just pushed the stroller into the driveway when Susan pulled up(mother's intuition!), so Susan came up while Amelia had a "snack", and what a snack it was! Hmm, homemade macaroni and cheese, cubes of avocado, yogurt, peaches... the food kept coming and Amelia kept eating. Susan says she often will not eat much for a day or two and then seems to make up for it; today was one of those days for sure! </p>
<p>It was a lovely afternoon, as Susan was in no rush to leave. We had lunch together and I managed to get some video taping done of Amelia (and a bit with her mom too). I really wanted to tape Amelia climbing up and down the stairs, as she is really proficient at it, but of course the minute the tape was running Amelia found other things of interest to keep her busy. </p>
<p>She is such a darling little girl; she turns around to give me a big smile when she pauses for a minute and I get nice little cuddles too.</p>
<p>Amelia is very clear with her "Mama" and "Papa"; I think that "Nana" can't be far off. :)</p>
<p>Amelia took four steps today in the house and it won't be long before she is walking, although she does love to hold on to us with just one hand and move along a little faster. This is a girl on the move!  </p>
<p>The timing for a visit with Riku was perfect as, at 3:30 p.m., just as Susan decided they should be heading for home, Akane called to say Riku was awake and had just eaten. Susan dropped me off there on her way home, and Riku and I headed off to Parque Ninos Unidos, the local playground just a few blocks away from his house. </p>
<p>How he has changed in six weeks! No longer is he content to spend most of his time in the sandbox... not when there are ladders leading up to the rope dome!, and another up to the playhouse. Before this, Riku would climb up steps to the house but now he decided it was time to tackle the very steep ladder. He really stuggles to get his little legs up and his foot onto the rungs, even though they are quite a reach for him. </p>
<p>Oh, he was the only child in the little room just off the playground, and spent quite a long time in there, putting balls into the basketball hoop and drawing on a huge sheet of paper with pencil crayons. I was happy to be out of the hot sun; there are not many shady areas in that particular park. </p>
<p>Riku likes to explore there on his own and especially enjoys being chased around the grassed area. It was such fun being with him again.</p>
<p>His Daddy was going to be home for dinner at 6 p.m., before heading back to work, so Riku walked all the way home to be greeted by his very enthusiastic daddy.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/wednesday_with_riku.html">Wednesday with Riku...</a></h2>
								<p>Ah, what a pleasure it is to know that Riku is once more just around the corner from me. He and Akane are still adjusting from the long trip, so I spent the morning keeping myself busy in the house (phoned Uncle Frank for a nice long chat) until I heard from Akane. </p>
<p>We were to have record-breaking heat temps today (not sure yet that we did) so I decided this would be the perfect day to stay home and stay cool. I picked him up at 1 p.m. (he had slept until 11 a.m. after being awake from 3 a.m. until 6 a.m.) and he headed straight out the door to the yard. I stripped him down to diapers and sandals and he played so happily with three containers of water, some cups, his big dump truck, and a snack table with grapes, Fig Newtons, and a container of water. </p>
<p>I brought him in for a diaper change at one point and he looked sleepy lying there, so off he went for a one hour nap at 3 p.m. Time for a long cool bath after that and he obviously enjoyed having all his familiar items, including his bath alphabet letters, in the tub with him. We washed "Robin's" hair and then his, and he stayed in the water until his fingertips were wrinkled. </p>
<p>Riku's ability to understand and repeats words immediately has really improved. Tonight in the bathroom he pointed to the magazine rack and said "books"; I told him they were magazines and he instantly said it back to me and repeated it again. Wow! </p>
<p>Off he went upstairs to rediscover and play with old toys and the new ones from Bryn and Bry'. Riku really loves playing with a tiny jewellery box that contains a broken string of pearls and some clip-on earrings. He puts everything carefully back when he is finished with them and these get played with while he sits on the bed. He stayed up there on his own for a bit (he had just started doing this before he left for Japan) while I organized dinner for him. </p>
<p>When Akane arrived at 6 p.m. with his new car seat in the stroller, Riku was back outside playing with the water. He wasn't too happy to be dressed but his dad was out for dinner so he, Akane, and I went out too... Amici's for pizza, which was so good. Riku enjoyed walking along the wide sidewalk at night, looking at the big letters on signs and enjoying all the lights. </p>
<p>He ate a very good dinner, some pasta, a little pizza, applesauce, and a couple of tiny crusts from the pizza, and then promptly fell asleep on the way home, less than two minutes after the car started. Akane and I got him undressed, into a clean diaper, and he was nursing happily away when I left at 8:20. I am sure he is sound asleep in bed right now, and hope he sleeps through the night tonight.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/thursday_too_hot.html">Thursday... Too Hot!</a></h2>
								<p>After the hot hot day yesterday, Akane and I decided it would be wise to get out for a walk early in the day, so I met them at the house at 9:45. Riku wasn't too keen about getting in the stroller so he walked for many blocks, exploring all the new things along the way to Joseph Schmidt's chocolate store. We convinced him to get into the stroller after I carried him several blocks and soon Riku was fast asleep. </p>
<p>I was very hot and hungry by the time we got home. Riku came along with me too so we had a nice lunch with Grandpa, and Riku had some water time in the garden before his nap in the afternoon. </p>
<p>I have been singing the "ABC" song for several months and Riku has just recently started saying "WXY". Today, for the first time he finished it off completely by adding the  "and Z". It's interesting to see how fascinated he is with letters. He and Doug sat on the bed yesterday morning and Doug was just so amazed at how well he puts the letters into their right slots on his alphabet board. </p>
<p>Our day passed too quickly, ending up in the bedroom upstairs, while Riku played with my jewellery box and his blocks. Bryn came to pick him up for dinner at 6 p.m. and I was sad to see him go; I really missed my days with him while we apart and feel I am still catching up.</p>
<p>Gail went into surgery today at noon and I was anxiously waiting to hear from Tom as to how things went. Finally at 7 p.m. I called him and learned that Gail was in and out of surgery in just forty-five mintues; they stretched the opening to the bile duct and may have cleared away a couple of stones from the area. Gail was home and in pain and I spoke with her for only a few minutes. </p>
<p>I called Candy to fill her in and we had a long talk catching up on all our other news (amongst other things, Jen' and Pat have an offer in on a new house).  I had developed a sinus problem sometime during the day and felt really miserable a couple of hours after Riku left. I was happy to go upstairs and sit in bed catching up on some taped shows with a hot compress and some hot lemon juice. Yuck!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/cloudy_sf_friday.html">Cloudy SF Friday</a></h2>
								<p>It was a pleasure to wake up this morning to a heavy cloud cover over the hills opposite us. It was supposed to have cleared by noon, but this didn't happen. After all the heat of last week this was just fine with me. Susan, Kevin, and Amelia pulled up at 9 a.m. for the drive to the airport; what a treat to sit in the back seat with Amelia as she puckered up for kisses and strained backwards to get Doug to pay attention to her from the front seat. They are off to rainy Vancouver for Steve and Jen's wedding and will return on Sunday night. </p>
<p>Doug and I drove to the produce market for a box of both oranges and grapefruit, before returning home. Because of the floods and hurricanes in Florida prices are higher than ever, but still cheaper there than at the local stores. I have missed having my fruit bowl each day and it's time to get back on track. </p>
<p>Riku and I walked from his house to ours at 11 a.m. and there was a little glimmer of sunshine, but that was it for the day. However, Riku was more than happy to play for an hour and a half in the garden, watering all my plants with a small measuring cup and transferring the water from one container to another three. After a big bowl of grainy cereal and half a fresh peach, he was ready for a nap. He slept for almost two hours and still seemed tired when he awoke. </p>
<p>While he was napping I spoke with Gail, who is in a lot of upper chest pain from her probe yesterday. She was walking the floor and sounded horrible. Poor kid; tomorrow has to be better. </p>
<p>Riku and I had just a half hour left together before leaving for his house, so I popped him into a warm tub with his alphabet letters and Robin, the doll. Robin has to have his hair washed before Riku; it makes hair washing easier. </p>
<p>Akane nursed Riku while Doug put in the car seat and the luggage, and at 4:15 we picked Bryn up from work for the trip to the airport. Saying goodbye for just two days is not at all difficult, although I do wish I were going too! </p>
<p>Doug and I had a quiet evening at home, catching up on some emails after dinner, and then watching a rented video ("Before Sunrise") and some taped shows, which are ever-growing in number.</p>

								<p>No children to walk today, which means I didn't get a long walk in; how easily we fall into habits. It was a perfect day for one too as the weather has stayed coolish, thank goodness, but instead Doug and I spent the morning and early afternoon catching up on various individual chores in the house. Doug made up copies of all three of his books, and I got through some paper work and magazines. </p>
<p>Kelly called and we had some time to catch up on their weekend away and some news; this doesn't happen often enough and was such a treat. </p>
<p>At 2 p.m. we left for a double feature at the Balboa "Before Sunset" and "De-Lovely", both good films which we missed when they were first released. We shared a large box of popcorn and most of a second free refill too, so we didn't have dinner at home, just some fruit and cheese for Doug, and a big plate of raw vegies for me. We snacked on these while watching our second rented movie, "The Last Kiss", by an Italian director whose newest film we may see tomorrow. </p>
<p>In the mail today was a very nice little letter from Mykayla and a big parcel of photos from Ofoto so I can get busy at my photo albums this coming week and a half while Doug is away. No dinners to cook and no reason to tidy up the table for days on end. I'm hoping to get lots done.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/a_wet_fall_day.html">A Wet  Fall Day...</a></h2>
								<p>It poured rain all through the night and continued on well into the early afternoon today. It hasn't rained this hard and long for months, and I was happy to smell the fresh clean air that always comes with the rain. </p>
<p>I am also very productive on days like this so accomplished so much this morning (after a long and very enjoyable conference call on Skype with Glenn, Don, Beth, and Gail)... finished the ironing, cleared away some more paper work, and dated more photographs, a big job waiting for me this coming week. </p>
<p>I spoke with Susan for a long time as well, and could hear Amelia making lots of new sounds and her boisterous and loud "busy" sound in the background. Apparently, Amelia decided on the weekend that it was time to get on with the walking, as she spent lots of time practicing in the hotel room in Vancouver. Today she walked from their living room to the dining room, turning around, and stopping to pick things up along the way! Wow! Can't wait to see her in action. Last week Amelia was reluctant to crawl, but wanted to walk along holding hands. This week has seen the next step in her independence, doing it all on her own. How quickly our little girl is growing up! </p>
<p>The rain let up at 2 p.m. just as I walked over to pick up Riku for a few hours. I took along a bright yellow raincoat and red rainpants, both of which we bought for Brynnie many many years ago. I rang the bell downstairs to let Akane know I was on my way up and as I opened the door I could hear Riku squealing away, anticipating my arrival on the third floor. What a wonderful way to be greeted this is! </p>
<p>Riku looked just as adorable in the raincoat as Bryn and Caillie had, and we set off to explore the six wet blocks between his home and ours. There was a dog leaning out of a window; Riku stood there smiling up at him for at least eight minutes. Next he discovered a drainpipe with a great long thin stream of water (see photo) and was very reluctant to abandon it for anything else that might be ahead. However, a very large leaf caught his eye, and of course there were lots of people smiling at this little fellow in yellow, meandering along in his rain gear. </p>
<p>Finally, back at home, Riku wanted time in the "garden" and out he went, stopping first to collect his cup and two plastic containers to fill and refill with water. I finished up the ironing, filling up his big container from time to time (the stones had a very thorough wash!), and then made him up a big bowl of hot cereal with berries. He really loves mixed berries and sat eating so nicely until the bowl was empty. </p>
<p>Tuck-in time and Riku was asleep in just a few minutes with his five bed buddies tucked into his arms. When he awoke it was almost time to drive Doug to the airport for his flight to Florida. I sat in the back with him on the way there; he snacked on some buttered toast and didn't really perk up until the drive home, when he spotted some huge letters on the sides of two big buildings. We are all so amazed at Riku's interest in the alphabet but also in his ability to name the letters and place them in the right places on his alphabet board (which he insisted on taking in the car with him, and balanced on his lap all the way to the airport). </p>
<p>At home, raining again, and dark by now, Riku played with his cars and trucks on the kitchen rug while I made dinner for him... pasta, a small bowl of sauteed mushrooms (I should have cooked more), a bit more toast, and applesauce for dessert, with cranberries and raisins dropped into it (Riku's idea), and scooped up carefully with his spoon.</p>
<p>Riku requested "splash" time, so into the tub he went, which is where his parents found him at 8 p.m. when they came to collect him. He was anxious to nurse, the minute he saw his Mommy, so I put him into his pj's and off they headed for home, with Riku rubbing his eyes. I'm sure he was tucked in and sound asleep not long after he left. </p>
<p>I had two horrible nightmares last night, so my plan is to go up to bed early tonight and make up for lost sleep last night.   </p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/blue_skies_nothing_but_blue_sk.html">Blue Skies, Nothing but Blue Skies...</a></h2>
								<p>What a contrast between yesterday and today. It was a perfect fall day and I spent most of it outside. This morning I picked Amelia up at 11 a.m. and we walked through Golden Gate Park for three hours... twice around Stow Lake, twice through the rose garden, and around the conservatory twice as well... all because Amelia just slept and slept and kept right on sleeping. In total she slept for two and a quarter hours, and missed seeing a heron walk right across the sidewalk in front of us. He was inches away! </p>
<p>Susan was out for lunch and running some errands so I got to feed Amelia and spend some time playing with her at her house. What a lunch it was too... little dishes of homemade macaroni and cheese, sweet potato, some brown rice, avocado, half a kiwi, and half a container of yogurt! Amelia leaned forward for over half the meal, so she had apparently been building up a nice appetite on our walk. </p>
<p>There were two wonderful events in my day with Amelia today... I saw her really walk many many steps for the very first time and what a thrill that is to witness; she is amazingly steady on her feet too, except when she is excited (when her mom came in, for instance,) and then she tends to lead with her chest and plows ahead full steam! </p>
<p>During lunch I had Amelia practicing saying "Nana" (Susan had told me on the phone this morning that she had said it twice today!); Amelia co-operated beautifully, and repeated it about six or seven times. This was so wonderful to hear, and she seemed pleased that I was pleased, as she kept repeating it. What fun, and how honoured I am. </p>
<p>After lunch, I handed Amelia the baby kewpie doll we gave her for her birthday, and she was pointing to the doll's eyes. So, I pointed to my eyes, and then to her eyes several times, and by the time I left she was pointing out my eyes when asked and squinting up her own as well; Amelia is a quick study for sure. </p>
<p>Home for a quick bowl of fruit and yogurt for me, and I finished off the morning paper as well. I also had time to date a few photos from the digital camera, and answer an email from Caillie, dictated to her Mommy. Hans set up an email account for her, and it was a very sweet email, telling me (among other things) that she had a homework sheet tonight and that she LOVED homework! There were dozens of hugs and kisses at the end of it, put there by Caillie herself. A keeper for sure. </p>
<p>Then it was time to head off to pick up Riku for an hour and a half in the park near his house. Riku now walks most of the way there and  heads off squealing and running once he is in the park. </p>
<p>Again today, he headed straight for the two straight up and down ladders, absolutely determined to climb right up both... so I had to follow on one and haul my body up over the rails on the playhouse to keep up with him (he just slips under the rail) and convince him he couldn't go further up the rope dome on his own... I need Brynnie or Bryant up there ahead of us! </p>
<p>Riku, and a little girl called Lena, threw a ball back and forth to each other this afternoon, a first time for both of them. It was so sweet to watch them; they were both fairly shy with each other, but played "toss" for for about ten minutes. Her mother Sara said that Riku was going to be a real heartbreaker one day, but of course we know that he is already. </p>
<p>At seven p.m. we were back at his house for dinner with Akane, and Bryn; Akane had invited me over for a favourite dinner... omu-rice...    a deliciously flavoured rice tucked into a very light omelette. This particular one had eggplant over it as well, in a sauce, which was just delicious. I was determined to eat only half of a very large portion, but ended up sharing the other half with Akane. </p>
<p>I left after some reading/sitting/snuggling time with Riku and getting him into his pj's, all set for his mom to nurse him and tuck him in. Riku seems to be getting a bit of a cold and Susan thinks Amelia may be as well, so an early night seemed like a good idea. </p>
<p>Bryn headed back to work at 8 p.m. and I was home by 8:40.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/pumpkin_patch.html">Pumpkin Patch</a></h2>
								<p>Well, today was an exciting day, with first visits ever to a pumpkin patch for both Riku and Amelia. Susan (in a bright orange top and black pants, dressed perfectly for the occasion) and I drove to Half Moon Bay in the morning, in separate vehicles, to guarantee that both children would be sure to nap on the way there. They did. </p>
<p>Susan chose a patch for us with some rides (pony, train, and hay) and with lots of pumpkins scattered about in various guises... scary goblins, skeletons, families, etc. and both children showed some interest in those. Riku was particularly taken with blow-up plastic airplanes, totally unrelated to the theme! Amelia was ever so anxious and willing to pat the ponies, but Riku wanted to look but not touch. When I asked him if he would like to go on the pony ride (he was too little really) he should his head solemnly and said "noooo". </p>
<p>Amelia was walking ever so capably around the not-so-even grounds and kept her Mommy busy. It is still a thrill to see this little girl walking! </p>
<p>We all went on the train ride and Riku would have been quite happy to go on again; instead we went on a hay ride, with only the four of us in the wagon. Amelia just wanted to stand up, which was forbidden, so Riku and Amelia sat and piled the hay up around them. Perhaps next year they will enjoy this particular ride more. </p>
<p>The children had lunch close enough that they could watch the ponies walking around in circles with older children riding them, and Riku spotted the "Goodnight Moon" decorations around the ring. </p>
<p>We decided to head off for another pumpkin patch to buy our pumpkins; this worked out very well as just down the road were hundreds and hundreds of pumpkins neatly lined up in the fields, with wheelbarrows and lots of time and freedom to choose them, in a far less crowded area.</p>
<p>Riku just loved this part of the trip; he was free to wander on his own and wander he did... over to another family and way out in all three directions, checking back now and them to make sure I was checking on him. </p>
<p>Meanwhile Amelia was getting her tan pants, and her shoes, very dirty by clambering in, on, and around the pumpkins having a great ol' time. She drummed on some nice fat pumpkins and had such fun. We each picked out two pumpkins and I bought a tiny one for Riku which he held on the way home. Susan and I both took lots of photos so eventually there will be an online photo album available! </p>
<p>We gave them snacks in the cars before leaving for home; Susan had some cheddar "bunnies" with her and Riku thought they were just delicious and good for "hopping" along the edge of his car seat too. They ate so much sitting there... fresh fruit, dried fruit, crackers, toast and Riku had some cereal too. I was hoping he would nap for the trip home, but no such luck... he had only twenty minutes, the last half of the trip, and was obviously still tired. I tried getting him into bed but he decided after twenty minutes of cuddling that that was enough, so off we went in the stroller for at least some quiet "down" time for an hour. </p>
<p>Oh, Riku said "Amelia" very clearly today and was so pleased when I repeated it back to him. He nods solemnly when he knows you have understood him.</p>
<p>We came back home with enough time for Riku to play with his cars, then in the garden with his water and containers. At 5:30 I managed to convince him to leave his toys and come for a car ride to Costco with his Mommy. We picked Akane up and spent didn't spend long picking up the few things we needed. </p>
<p>Back at home, Riku and I read lots of books and played with his blocks while Akane prepared dinner. Bryn came home and joined us at the table. It was very tasty and we all enjoyed it; Riku was ready for bed, so Bryn and I got him into a new pair of very cute two piece pj's, I brushed his teeth, read two books and left him in his room with his Mommy, ready to nurse.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/chinatown_outing.html">Chinatown Outing</a></h2>
								<p>Akane, Riku, and I took a bus to Chinatown this morning; we had hoped the rain would hold off for us and it did. Akane planned to buy some soft shoes for Riku to go with his Chinese outfit for Hallowe'en, and we thought lunch out was a good plan too, while we were in the area.. </p>
<p>Akane had found a vegetarian Chinese spot for us that is very popular, so lunch first, in order to beat the business crowd. We ordered three dishes... deep fried soft tofu in a brown sauce, eggplant and tofu stuffed with poi, and a dish of three mushrooms with noodles, all delicious. We took home the leftovers. </p>
<p>Riku tried on some sweet red slippers with roosters and feathers, but they were too small. Too bad, as they would have gone perfectly with his red and black outfit but we were lucky enough to find plain black slippers in his size. We let Riku walk quite a bit, as he was completely fascinated with so many things on display but the streets were also very crowded in some areas, and he was getting tired. </p>
<p>Akane stopped to nurse him, bought a few vegetables and noodles in a shop, and we were on a bus for home with a very tired little boy. He fell asleep on the bus, and again did not have a long enough sleep to make up for all the hours he was awake. I put him right into his stroller and walked around the Mission District for an hour, but again he just did not quite give in to a nap. </p>
<p>Back at my place, Riku gestured that he wanted me to pull up the chair and reach the button box for him, then went on to play with his cars, and outside for just a bit before we drove back to his house for dinner with his Daddy and Mommy. Akane cooked up a delicious green bean dish with garlic and sauce, and served it along with our leftovers from lunch, freshly cooked brown rice, and some little egg rolls she had picked up at Costco.</p>
<p>I read Riku a couple of stories after changing him into his pj's and left him ready to go to bed, a tired little fellow for sure.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/a_quiet_saturday.html">A Quiet  Saturday</a></h2>
								<p>I was awake early today and managed to get quite a few emails answered before dashing off to pick Doug up from the airport at 9:44 a.m. He has been in Florida and had less than an hour at home to pack up again for a trip to Warsaw, via London. Even though his plane was a bit late, and the bags slow coming into the baggage claim area we were home by 10:20. Doug was very efficient, as he had done a lot of prep work before leaving on Tuesday, and even managed to clear up a couple of computer problems on his machine for me (mine broke last week and there is a new Dell waiting to be hooked up next week). </p>
<p>Will be waiting to hear how Doug's first trip to Poland goes for him! He has tomorrow free to wander about and then teaches the next two days. </p>
<p>I ran a couple of errands on the way home, and then spent the rest of the day sitting in front of the computer dating and rearranging photos in online albums. Not a very exciting day, but a productive one for sure. It was raining heavily at some points, which made staying in more attractive than it normally would have.  </p>
<p>I took a break, made some tea, put together a fruit bowl and went upstairs to watch a couple of taped shows. I had enough energy to spend a few more hours on the photos and was very pleased with all that I accomplished today... there is not one photo left undated on the kitchen counter or the dining room table. Whew! </p>
<p>I phoned Akane thinking that if Bryn were working late, and not going home for dinner, that we could have some pasta together here, but Brent phoned with an offer of homemade chicken pot pie for them ensuring that Bryn did indeed get home for dinner. </p>
<p>No Riku, no Amelia... how very odd.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/making_up_for_yesterday.html">Making Up for Yesterday...</a></h2>
								<p>Well, today was a much better day, as I saw both children! Bryn phoned this morning to invite me out for breakfast with them at "Jim's Restaurant", an old favourite of theirs. </p>
<p>I had had a lazy morning, writing emails, and chatting with all of the children in Toronto; Myk' was practicing the piano, and Caillie thought Bryn was in the shower, but eventually I spoke with them all.</p>
<p>Caillie had just completed a fairy puzzle she had received for her birthday and they were getting ready to go off to the dog park with Manitou. After speaking with Bryn, I scooted upstairs and managed to shower, wipe down the shower stall, make the bed, plus make Riku some hot cereal with berries, cut up a little pear for him, and make him one cup of fresh orange juice before Bryn and Riku picked me up twenty-five minutes later. Whew!</p>
<p>Breakfast really hit the spot... two fried eggs, over medium-well (there), really good hash browns which Riku shared, whole wheat toast and tea. Yum! I could have eaten twice the potatoes... a rare treat. </p>
<p>Riku is such a sociable little boy. A family came in and sat at the booth behind us, and Riku spent almost all the rest of our time there observing every little thing the two children did. He is very open and unembarrassed about being such a voyeur! </p>
<p>We all walked over to a book store on Valencia with Riku calling out letters on signs on the two block walk. I pointed out the gas markings on the sidewalk today, so now he knows there are letters down as well as up. What an exciting world it is!</p>
<p>Riku was just adorable in the book store. He chose a book and then went on to sit in three different seats while looking around and observing people. At one point, a fellow sitting in a chair smiled at Riku as he walked by, so of course Riku smiled back, engaged him in conversation, gesturing to all the books, waving his arms around in animation and totally enchanting the man. It was really something to witness as he is quite a charmer. </p>
<p>Riku was ready for a nap by the time we were in the car on the way home, so I headed home for some emails and Bryn went off to work. At 2 p.m. Bryn suggested that a walk with Amelia would make lots of folks happy... Amelia, who always is up for a walk, Susan, who could use a little time on her own, and Kevin, whom Bryn had planned to work with this afternoon. I was missing Amelia; it seemed a long time since Thursday, and I was over at Ashbury Street at 2:45. </p>
<p>Kevin brought Amelia to the door, in his arms, and Amelia immediately stretched out her arms to me, and gave me the biggest hug I have ever had from a child so young. Both arms and a long hug too... so sweet; no wonder she has stolen my heart! She looked just adorable too, in  a black top with black pants decorated with big white cow spots. </p>
<p>Susan had mentioned a street fair on Cole Street; a few blocks later we were there, with Amelia getting her full share of dog-watching. This little girl is just mad about dogs and doesn't miss one of them.  We wandered for a bit, and the food smelled wonderful, so I ended up buying, and eating, two absolutely wonderful samosas. Amelia had a snack too and then we off for our usual walk in Golden Gate Park. Just ten minutes later Amelia was asleep. The park is very quiet on Sundays, as they close it off to vehicular traffic... no cars, noisy motorcyles, and this is just what Amelia needs for a good nap. I strolled around Stow Lake twice again today, as it was obvious this wasn't going to be a one hour nap today. </p>
<p>We were gone for almost three hours in total, I said goodbyes to all , and dashed off at 6:25 to pick up Riku and Akane for a trip to Rainbow Grocers. Riku knows by now just where the cheese is, and headed straight for his free sample, then said "olive?" and headed off for those. Today's flavour wasn't a favourite... cumin, so I got to eat all but one bite of his. </p>
<p>I carried Riku up the stairs, he said "Bye Nana" and off I went. I will be spending the day with him tomorrow so decided I should finish the Sunday newspaper, watch a couple more taped shows, eat something... fruit bowl, two slices of toast, and tea, and now it's bed time... past midnight tonight. Too late.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/chaotic_tuesday.html">Chaotic Tuesday</a></h2>
								<p>But a good chaotic, as my kitchen is in the process of being professionally painted at last! The painters arrived at 8 a.m. and it wasn't long before I had no access to the laundry room, pantry or the back door, with a plastic door blocking me off from the eating area. </p>
<p>All the furniture is in Riku's room, the dining room,and/or the living room, the walls are bare, and three men are buzzing around putting up tape, applying patching material, sanding and cleaning the walls. </p>
<p>I spent most of the day on the computer sorting photos in various albums, took a cup of tea and some fruit upstairs at 4 p.m. when I had the house to myself again, and enjoyed the quiet. By 5 p.m. I was ready for a little fresh air, so called Akane and arranged to spend a little time with Riku before Bryn got home. However, he was there when I arrived a few minutes later (I ran over), and the three of us spent some time building blocks, a tunnel, and reading a bit before Akane called them for dinner. Riku is such fun to be with; he enjoys having company and is a happy little fellow, not be mention handsome as can be! </p>
<p>It was a good end to my day and that evening Gail, Candy, and I were chatting about our upcoming trip to Hawaii (Beth was at work) and before I went to bed, Gail and I had booked our flight from Oakland to Honolulu, for February 16th. Now it's Candy and Beth's turn, and we are hoping that we all end up travelling together.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/10/wednesday_with_amelia.html">Wednesday with Amelia</a></h2>
								<p>This morning I chatted with Gail, Candy, Beth and Don on Skype until the noise from the sander in the kitchen made it impossible. Candy could only hear us and was not able to join in, so she had gone off early as well. </p>
<p>At 9:15 a.m. I left to spend hours with Amelia; what a treat! She had the sweetest outfit on, a matching dress and coat, both covered in bright tiny embroidered flowers in a gorgeous fabric. I have photos! </p>
<p>Susan was off for a massage, and Amelia and I left for our usual walk through the park. This was timed perfectly as Amelia was ready for her morning nap. </p>
<p>It was a gorgeous day, clear, bright, and eventually quite warm. Amelia slept for an hour and a half and I walked twice around the lake enjoying the ducks and the hawk circling above what one man called the "squirrel tree". </p>
<p>Back at home, Amelia was ready for, and ate, a huge lunch. Susan had left her homemade macaroni and cheese, sweet potato, nori to be sprinkled into the latter, and a plate with sunflower seeds, apricot bits and cranberries. However, also out were avocado and kiwi, and yogurt in the fridge, so I gave her some of all of these before giving her the dessert plate. I love the way she leans forward for every bite until she is finally full. </p>
<p>Amelia repeated "Mama", "Dada" and "Nana" when she woke up and also paid close attention to every dog that went by. She slaps her thigh and makes panting noises when she spots them which ensures that I don't miss them either. This is such a smart little girl! </p>
<p>Susan came home while we were playing on the floor; Amelia was busy taking things out of my bag, and throwing my credit cards about. After a half hour or so she seemed fussy (those swollen molars are the reason, we think) so I volunteered to take her over to the park for a walk and play time. What fun that was! </p>
<p>Amelia loves to push things, so after pushing her own stroller to the play area, and then pushing a plastic chair around the concrete, Amelia latched on to a mom coming in the gate with her own child in a stroller. Amelia instantly volunteered to help and went over, took hold of the back of it, and pushed away. It was the cutest thing and, of course, the woman was very co-operative and allowed Amelia to "help" her. Eventually the child wanted out, so Amelia patiently waited, before continuing around the circle twice more pushing with all her might. </p>
<p>And what sturdy legs she has too! I was quite amazed at how well Amelia balances in the sand; occasionally she fell over, would reach out for a hand up, and then immediately start walking again. </p>
<p>This tired her out eventually; she was ready to go into the stroller, and fell asleep about ten minutes of dog watching, just as I was heading for home with her. The plan was to take her home after an hour, but of course I was not going to wake her up, so back to the park we went. This time around I walked just to the rose garden and then tracked back a new way, ending up behind the lawn bowling club. After an hour of sleeping, Amelia puckered up for a few kisses, I took her home and I headed for home myself at 4:40 p.m. </p>
<p>I arrived home to even more chaos than yesterday! The entire kitchen is now shrouded in plastic... the stovetop, the fridge, the counters and sink, and the door way to the dining room is now covered as well. The bathroom downstairs is completely unusable as well... also covered in plastic. The dining room and living room now hold all the contents of these two rooms. </p>
<p>Dinner was a bit of a struggle; I managed to get under the plastic and dig out a frozen pizza, added some mushrooms, pesto, and more sauce to it, and put it in the (uncovered) oven. I took refuge upstairs in my bedroom to eat in where things still look tidy. If I hadn't been so tuckered out I might have been tempted to go out for Thai food. </p>
<p>I unpacked my bag just now and discovered two wonderful dishes Susan had picked up for me in Japantown, inari, and tofu with sauce, which would have hit the spot perfectly, if I had discovered them earlier! Can't wait for tomorrow!</p>
