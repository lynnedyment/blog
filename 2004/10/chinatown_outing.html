								<h2>Chinatown Outing</h2>
								<p>Akane, Riku, and I took a bus to Chinatown this morning; we had hoped the rain would hold off for us and it did. Akane planned to buy some soft shoes for Riku to go with his Chinese outfit for Hallowe'en, and we thought lunch out was a good plan too, while we were in the area.. </p>
<p>Akane had found a vegetarian Chinese spot for us that is very popular, so lunch first, in order to beat the business crowd. We ordered three dishes... deep fried soft tofu in a brown sauce, eggplant and tofu stuffed with poi, and a dish of three mushrooms with noodles, all delicious. We took home the leftovers. </p>
<p>Riku tried on some sweet red slippers with roosters and feathers, but they were too small. Too bad, as they would have gone perfectly with his red and black outfit but we were lucky enough to find plain black slippers in his size. We let Riku walk quite a bit, as he was completely fascinated with so many things on display but the streets were also very crowded in some areas, and he was getting tired. </p>
<p>Akane stopped to nurse him, bought a few vegetables and noodles in a shop, and we were on a bus for home with a very tired little boy. He fell asleep on the bus, and again did not have a long enough sleep to make up for all the hours he was awake. I put him right into his stroller and walked around the Mission District for an hour, but again he just did not quite give in to a nap. </p>
<p>Back at my place, Riku gestured that he wanted me to pull up the chair and reach the button box for him, then went on to play with his cars, and outside for just a bit before we drove back to his house for dinner with his Daddy and Mommy. Akane cooked up a delicious green bean dish with garlic and sauce, and served it along with our leftovers from lunch, freshly cooked brown rice, and some little egg rolls she had picked up at Costco.</p>
<p>I read Riku a couple of stories after changing him into his pj's and left him ready to go to bed, a tired little fellow for sure.</p>
