								<h2>Wednesday with Amelia</h2>
								<p>This morning I chatted with Gail, Candy, Beth and Don on Skype until the noise from the sander in the kitchen made it impossible. Candy could only hear us and was not able to join in, so she had gone off early as well. </p>
<p>At 9:15 a.m. I left to spend hours with Amelia; what a treat! She had the sweetest outfit on, a matching dress and coat, both covered in bright tiny embroidered flowers in a gorgeous fabric. I have photos! </p>
<p>Susan was off for a massage, and Amelia and I left for our usual walk through the park. This was timed perfectly as Amelia was ready for her morning nap. </p>
<p>It was a gorgeous day, clear, bright, and eventually quite warm. Amelia slept for an hour and a half and I walked twice around the lake enjoying the ducks and the hawk circling above what one man called the "squirrel tree". </p>
<p>Back at home, Amelia was ready for, and ate, a huge lunch. Susan had left her homemade macaroni and cheese, sweet potato, nori to be sprinkled into the latter, and a plate with sunflower seeds, apricot bits and cranberries. However, also out were avocado and kiwi, and yogurt in the fridge, so I gave her some of all of these before giving her the dessert plate. I love the way she leans forward for every bite until she is finally full. </p>
<p>Amelia repeated "Mama", "Dada" and "Nana" when she woke up and also paid close attention to every dog that went by. She slaps her thigh and makes panting noises when she spots them which ensures that I don't miss them either. This is such a smart little girl! </p>
<p>Susan came home while we were playing on the floor; Amelia was busy taking things out of my bag, and throwing my credit cards about. After a half hour or so she seemed fussy (those swollen molars are the reason, we think) so I volunteered to take her over to the park for a walk and play time. What fun that was! </p>
<p>Amelia loves to push things, so after pushing her own stroller to the play area, and then pushing a plastic chair around the concrete, Amelia latched on to a mom coming in the gate with her own child in a stroller. Amelia instantly volunteered to help and went over, took hold of the back of it, and pushed away. It was the cutest thing and, of course, the woman was very co-operative and allowed Amelia to "help" her. Eventually the child wanted out, so Amelia patiently waited, before continuing around the circle twice more pushing with all her might. </p>
<p>And what sturdy legs she has too! I was quite amazed at how well Amelia balances in the sand; occasionally she fell over, would reach out for a hand up, and then immediately start walking again. </p>
<p>This tired her out eventually; she was ready to go into the stroller, and fell asleep about ten minutes of dog watching, just as I was heading for home with her. The plan was to take her home after an hour, but of course I was not going to wake her up, so back to the park we went. This time around I walked just to the rose garden and then tracked back a new way, ending up behind the lawn bowling club. After an hour of sleeping, Amelia puckered up for a few kisses, I took her home and I headed for home myself at 4:40 p.m. </p>
<p>I arrived home to even more chaos than yesterday! The entire kitchen is now shrouded in plastic... the stovetop, the fridge, the counters and sink, and the door way to the dining room is now covered as well. The bathroom downstairs is completely unusable as well... also covered in plastic. The dining room and living room now hold all the contents of these two rooms. </p>
<p>Dinner was a bit of a struggle; I managed to get under the plastic and dig out a frozen pizza, added some mushrooms, pesto, and more sauce to it, and put it in the (uncovered) oven. I took refuge upstairs in my bedroom to eat in where things still look tidy. If I hadn't been so tuckered out I might have been tempted to go out for Thai food. </p>
<p>I unpacked my bag just now and discovered two wonderful dishes Susan had picked up for me in Japantown, inari, and tofu with sauce, which would have hit the spot perfectly, if I had discovered them earlier! Can't wait for tomorrow!</p>
