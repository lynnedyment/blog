								<h2>Blue Skies, Nothing but Blue Skies...</h2>
								<p>What a contrast between yesterday and today. It was a perfect fall day and I spent most of it outside. This morning I picked Amelia up at 11 a.m. and we walked through Golden Gate Park for three hours... twice around Stow Lake, twice through the rose garden, and around the conservatory twice as well... all because Amelia just slept and slept and kept right on sleeping. In total she slept for two and a quarter hours, and missed seeing a heron walk right across the sidewalk in front of us. He was inches away! </p>
<p>Susan was out for lunch and running some errands so I got to feed Amelia and spend some time playing with her at her house. What a lunch it was too... little dishes of homemade macaroni and cheese, sweet potato, some brown rice, avocado, half a kiwi, and half a container of yogurt! Amelia leaned forward for over half the meal, so she had apparently been building up a nice appetite on our walk. </p>
<p>There were two wonderful events in my day with Amelia today... I saw her really walk many many steps for the very first time and what a thrill that is to witness; she is amazingly steady on her feet too, except when she is excited (when her mom came in, for instance,) and then she tends to lead with her chest and plows ahead full steam! </p>
<p>During lunch I had Amelia practicing saying "Nana" (Susan had told me on the phone this morning that she had said it twice today!); Amelia co-operated beautifully, and repeated it about six or seven times. This was so wonderful to hear, and she seemed pleased that I was pleased, as she kept repeating it. What fun, and how honoured I am. </p>
<p>After lunch, I handed Amelia the baby kewpie doll we gave her for her birthday, and she was pointing to the doll's eyes. So, I pointed to my eyes, and then to her eyes several times, and by the time I left she was pointing out my eyes when asked and squinting up her own as well; Amelia is a quick study for sure. </p>
<p>Home for a quick bowl of fruit and yogurt for me, and I finished off the morning paper as well. I also had time to date a few photos from the digital camera, and answer an email from Caillie, dictated to her Mommy. Hans set up an email account for her, and it was a very sweet email, telling me (among other things) that she had a homework sheet tonight and that she LOVED homework! There were dozens of hugs and kisses at the end of it, put there by Caillie herself. A keeper for sure. </p>
<p>Then it was time to head off to pick up Riku for an hour and a half in the park near his house. Riku now walks most of the way there and  heads off squealing and running once he is in the park. </p>
<p>Again today, he headed straight for the two straight up and down ladders, absolutely determined to climb right up both... so I had to follow on one and haul my body up over the rails on the playhouse to keep up with him (he just slips under the rail) and convince him he couldn't go further up the rope dome on his own... I need Brynnie or Bryant up there ahead of us! </p>
<p>Riku, and a little girl called Lena, threw a ball back and forth to each other this afternoon, a first time for both of them. It was so sweet to watch them; they were both fairly shy with each other, but played "toss" for for about ten minutes. Her mother Sara said that Riku was going to be a real heartbreaker one day, but of course we know that he is already. </p>
<p>At seven p.m. we were back at his house for dinner with Akane, and Bryn; Akane had invited me over for a favourite dinner... omu-rice...    a deliciously flavoured rice tucked into a very light omelette. This particular one had eggplant over it as well, in a sauce, which was just delicious. I was determined to eat only half of a very large portion, but ended up sharing the other half with Akane. </p>
<p>I left after some reading/sitting/snuggling time with Riku and getting him into his pj's, all set for his mom to nurse him and tuck him in. Riku seems to be getting a bit of a cold and Susan thinks Amelia may be as well, so an early night seemed like a good idea. </p>
<p>Bryn headed back to work at 8 p.m. and I was home by 8:40.</p>
