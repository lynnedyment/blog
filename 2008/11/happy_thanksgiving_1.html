								<h2>Happy Thanksgiving!</h2>
								<p>We had a very quiet relaxing day here today, starting off with Riku and me reading for forty minutes in bed. I made up his fruit plate for him about halfway through, and when I went in with it, Riku had continued reading the Shel Silverstein poems. Such a sweet sight! </p>
<p>We did lots of fun things... in the morning Riku painted a big bright picture, made a thank you card for Lili and Sam with the paints, continued on with his surprise Christmas gifts, started a sweet potato plant, and played with his Lego set. I had hoped to go out to see Andy Goldsworthy's latest creation in the Presidio, but Riku nixed that plan, and so we went with his idea of some time in the playground, just off  the top of Rhode Island Street. Tom and Doug stayed home, and Gail, Riku, and I drove off for an hour. Riku loves playing "monster", and Gail and I between us, kept him busy and happy running around. </p>
<p>Then it was home for lunch upstairs while watching "ET". Riku told me he wanted just fruit for lunch, something that he asks for a lot these days. After his birthday party two weeks ago, I asked him if he would like a slice of carrot cake or a brownie, and his answer was "I will just have some strawberries"! Today, though, he did surprise me by getting into his Hallowe'en candy and having a piece of chocolate. With the mints he made a container of "poison", and labelled it as such, by adding the mints to water and tossing in some clay bits too. </p>
<p>Gail and I watched "ET" with him and he went from snuggling one of us to the other. We were warm and cozy up there, and Riku thoroughly enjoyed it all. Nothing is scary if someone is there watching with you! </p>
<p>After the movie, Riku watched Grandpa put together the dinosaur, finally freed of the clay. He had dug it all out a couple of days ago, but it needed the final bits dug out of the bones themselves. It was a little hard for Riku to assemble himself, as even Doug found parts of it hard to do, but he sure liked it when it was finished. He set it up looking as though he had eaten part of a building and was leaning against the rest of it. </p>
<p>Riku has been asking to talk to Bryn for the past two days, wanting to fill him in on things he has done and seen, and today we lucked out timing-wise. Bryn IM'd from Kyoto, not long before they were leaving their hotel, and so we got up on Skype together. Riku was such a happy boy, talking with his sister, telling he bought her something special that was pink. She replied "What is it?" and he told her it was a surprise. He was obviously delighted to be talking with her, and kept telling her all sorts of things on his mind. Auntie Gail said hello to Mirei too, and it will be such fun to see her next week. Riku talked to his mom and dad too. </p>
<p>Gail had suggested yesterday that we make a proper Thanksgiving dinner, something I normally wouldn't have bothered with. However, Riku asked this afternoon if we were going to do something for Thanksgiving, and so I was very glad we had a plan. I had a couple of frozen bean loaves in the freezer, so we cooked those up, Gail did a big potful of combined carrots and parsnips, I made up some mashed potatoes, and Gail did the gravy while I bathed Riku. He was a tired boy, more so than he should have been, considering he has been sleeping eleven plus hours every night since he arrived, but he was very sensitive and needy, and the tub was exactly what he needed to just relax and be ready for his special dinner. </p>
<p>We lit candles, put Riku's centerpiece (which he made yesterday with Amelia) on the table, and hung his turkey drawing in the dining room, making it look and feel very festive. Riku had seconds and thirds of the mashed potatoes and the bean loaf, really liked the cranberry jelly, but passed on the gravy. Dinner was delicious, Tom poured the wine, and dessert was pumpkin pie. </p>
<p>Riku was sound asleep at 7:25, after a Henry and Mudge book and just three poems. The weather is supposed to be warmer tomorrow, and we're hoping for an Ocean Beach day! </p>
<p>Gail and I enjoyed tea and cards, after the guys cleared up most of the kitchen, Doug unloaded and loaded the dishwasher, and I caught up on a few emails to long-neglected friends. Bedtime too late for me again, but I got my blog done!</p>
