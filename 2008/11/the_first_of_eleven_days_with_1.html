								<h2>The First of Eleven Days with Riku</h2>
								<p>Mirei arrived all sparkly and full of beans this morning at 8:30. I asked her dad to bring her along for an hour this morning, before their flight, so I could have just a little extra time with her. I've been gone recently for ten days and now she's leaving me for ten... twenty days too many! </p>
<p>We snuggled on the sofa and read three books, the first one three times, just so she made sure she had it down pat, I think. She played with the doctor kit, as one of her favourite things to do these days is open the bandage package on her own, and stick as many as she can get away with on various places on my body. Today I "hurt" on the arm, my hip, and my chest, but felt much better after Dr. Dyment attended to me. Then it was time for an extra breakfast for her. She drew while I fed her two scrambled eggs and some toast and juice; I was astounded to see her draw a face with eyeglasses, but unfortunately she scribbled on it before I could get a clear shot of it. I might try anyway, and post it later. </p>
<p>Doug was driving Akane, Bryn, and Mirei to the airport, so we had some running-around time while we waited for her parents. How she loved it! She and Doug were "racing" back and forth touching a tree to be the winner. We did this last night on the way home too, and she runs fast! At 9:50 A.M. I waved goodbye. Bryn called from the plane at 11:30 to say they spent less than two minutes in the various line-ups. If you have a child on hand these days you get very good service! </p>
<p>I picked Riku up from school, the first of our ten days, eleven nights together. He was surprised we weren't having our "picnic" as usual, but of course he can now have his snacks here at home with me. The conversation is always interesting. Today we talked about my being "poor" because I don't have a mommy and a daddy; I told him Grandpa didn't either and that most people our age do not have parents. Then we discussed how old I would be when he is a daddy, and that his daddy would then be a grandpa. We talked about mean people, and mean parents and grandparents, which Riku thinks is very sad. This came up after a neighbour, also a grandma, stopped to say hello to him; he decided she was a nice grandma. </p>
<p>I have come up with a plan for Riku's school days here and today it worked for us both like a charm. First, snack and about forty-five minutes of free time, which he spent working on excavating his dinosaur from clay, an ongoing project that he loves. Then it was time for piano practice. I sat with him for twenty-five minutes and he was quite happy to go over his pieces, with some explanations involved about what certain notes meant and how he should play them. Doug sat with him for the last five minutes and both of us were amazed at how fast those little fingers can move! </p>
<p>I had a wonderful call from one of my doula moms, Sheila, someone I have been thinking about a lot lately. I was delighted to hear from her, and invited her over for a visit tomorrow. I just cannot wait to see her already nine-month-old daughter! </p>
<p>Kelly and I had a few minutes together chatting online, a rare treat. She had just won a $50 Starbucks card on a radio contest, and is thinking about using it to take her grade one/two split class out for hot chocolate before she turns them over to a new teacher next week. She will have a new class the following week. It was good to catch up a little bit with her and hear about the children; it has been too long since I have talked with any of them except Caillie, who called three times on the weekend. </p>
<p>One other bonus treat for me today was an email from the mom I visited in the hospital on Tuesday; the dad sent me photos of their first baby, a girl whose birth I attended sixteen months ago. She's a beauty still... as is her new baby sister. I'm hoping to visit with them some time very soon! </p>
<p>After piano came about twenty minutes of free time again, which Riku spent part of making the first of several Christmas gifts for various people, mostly cousins and friends. We have just enough time to finish them off if he gets one done a day.Then it was time for two pages of homework... recognizing the beginnings of words, and working on penny and nickel questions.</p>
<p>Then came tub time, dinner — pasta, peas and corn — followed by Riku reading to me in the living room, nice and comfy. He did a fabulous job reading "Ten Apples up on Top", with a seventy-five word vocabulary, but I was very impressed with the expression with which he read it. I must tape him one day, as it was such fun to hear the story read with such enthusiasm. </p>
<p>He had a few minutes to play with one of his two birthday gifts from Auntie Candy and Uncle Rick.. two figures from Star Wars, a big hit! I have one tucked away for another day, and I'm sure he will reach for them as soon as he wakens tomorrow, as I noticed he put them on his bedside table. </p>
<p>Tuck-in time was 7:05 P.M. I wanted to start a chapter book with him, a book Doug found for him called "My Father's Dragon". It just happens to have ten chapters so we will finish it before he goes back home. Perfect! It's a good little book, and Riku would have been happy to have continued on with it, but we agreed that it was fun to wait until tomorrow to see what happens. </p>
<p>He had chosen two books as well... "Don't Let the Pigeon Stay up Late", and "I'm Bad", a pretty silly book that made us both laugh. Almost always when Riku sleeps over, he wraps his arm around my neck and tells me "this is the best part", as he used to when he was just a little boy. It always touched my heart, and still does. I closed his door at 7:30, leaving him sleeping... and went up to watch two taped TV shows with Doug. He gave me a nice back rub, and I fell sound asleep for bits and pieces of the last show! </p>
<p>Bed for me at 11:15... Akane, Bryn, and Mirei are probably waiting for their luggage in Osaka at this point... such a long long day for them all.</p>
