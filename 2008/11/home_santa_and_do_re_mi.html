								<h2>"Home", Santa, and "Do Re Mi"!</h2>
								<p>Today was just the best of days! Riku woke at six o'clock, an hour too early for me, so I suggested we sleep until seven, and at ten to Riku woke me up asking if I would like to read another poem. He's a big Silverstein fan, this boy!</p>
<p>We did read about eight poems, then he was off to the kitchen to paint a big new picture. While the paint was out, he worked on two more of his Christmas projects and did some art work on the thank you note for Lili and Sam too. </p>
<p>When we were in bed, Riku asked if we could go to his home this morning, so he could play with his toys, and put the Lego he had built here at his house. "Of course!" I replied, and for that I got a big kiss and a big "thank you, I love you" too! So, that was our plan for the morning. He happily puttered about, playing with his Lego, the dino, and working at his desk, while I had a lazy morning with a leisurely breakfast with Gail and Tom, reading the paper. At 11:30, Gail, Riku, and I headed off to his house. </p>
<p>He was funny though, as he tried so hard to convince me to take the car instead of walking. I rarely drive the car to his house and felt we all needed the walk, so then he told me he would be "embarrassed" if anyone saw him carrying his Lego monster. I suggested a green cloth bag, instead of the plastic one he had put it in originally, so that was that argument closed. Today he told me he would be "livid" about something, a word I have never heard him use before. That led us to coming up with lots of words for anger; one he used the other day was "furious". Fun to hear all these new words emerging. </p>
<p>We spent two full hours at "home", with Riku busy in his room for a while, building Lego, bringing one DVD after another out for us to see (Gail and I played cards in the kitchen while drinking tea), and showing Gail a brochure of some of the Lego kits he had. The time really flew by, and so I made Riku a grilled cheese sandwich, before heading back home. We stopped to show Gail the sculpture he often climbs at the hospital. He skipped between us holding hands, and we counted all the way to over 300 on our way. Gail suggested this and started by counting to twenty, then it was his turn and then mine. </p>
<p>Back at home, Riku wanted to watch a taped Japanese movie he couldn't watch at home. I didn't sit with him as usual, but did stay in the room sorting through children's clothes to take to Patricia and to give to Susan. Gail and I ran those off to Patrizia when the movie had ended. Riku stayed home with "the guys", while Gail and I had about fifteen minutes with Patrizia and the baby. I had the Japanese Miffi walker for him as well as Riku's saucer seat, fondly referred to at one point as his "office". </p>
<p>Our afternoon plan was to see the big tree at Ghirardelli Square lit at 5:30, so I made Riku two scrambled eggs with bacon to tide him over until dinner. He had also eaten grapes and toast and some cheese as a snack watching the movie, so I knew he had a full tummy. We had the best time! We got there early enough that we were very close to the tree, closer than we have even been before. We even had a good view of Santa before he went on stage! The half hour before the show began passed quickly, as Riku had a (Sky) Blue candy cane that we each received when arriving, Gail had found some hot apple cider for Riku to sip on, and at one point they made it "snow" on us, much to Riku's delight! It  was soapy, thick flakes but looked very realistic coming down, which was such fun for all of us. We saw a tiny bit of "A Christmas Carol" (and ended up discussing it in the car on the way home), sang some Christmas songs with a local school group, and the best part of all was that Riku got to talk to Santa briefly. He had told me days ago that he was going to ask Santa if he really lived at the North Pole, and that is exactly what he did tonight. Santa's answer was "yes", and Riku walked away smiling, with a Ghirardelli chocolate square in his hand. </p>
<p>We had been lucky enough to find parking very close to the Square and as soon as we got in the car, Riku opened his window and started calling out in a very loud voice "<strong>Merry Christmas! Ho Ho Ho!</strong>" It was just hilarious as he wasn't the least bit embarrassed and in fact seemed to be taking huge delight in doing so. He turned some heads tonight and it was such fun to hear him being so boisterous and outgoing. At some point, he closed his window and led us all into a grand round of "Do Re Mi", instructing us all to sing together, then one at a time, telling us which one was up next. We sang all the way to Safeway, right until the minute we turned off the engine. </p>
<p>He buzzed around the store with Gail and me, and spotted frozen mac' and cheese in the refrigerated area, and told me he "<strong>loved</strong>" that dinner, and then when he heard Gail and Tom suggest we have pizza, their treat, he told me he loved that too. I don't believe the food this boy is tucking away this week! Doug picked up an Amy's organic mac' and cheese, and home we came with our purchases, singing all the way home too. Riku got into his PJs lickety-split, ate most of the mac and cheese with some peas, drank two small glasses of apple juice, and polished off a custard cup of coconut pineapple ice cream which we had also replenished at the store. </p>
<p>While eating, Riku drew four(!) pictures, promising both Gail and me two of them, and laughing at our "arguments" about who would get each one. Kelly called at one point to suggest that we take him to see "Bolt" and so he had a little chat with her about their favourite parts of the movie. He told her he was going to make her Christmas present tomorrow, but was wise enough not to say what it was. </p>
<p>Tonight was the latest that Riku was tucked in, but I was pleased to close his door at 8:05. Gail had tea made and the cards set up, and that was our day... a lovely one indeed!  </p>
