								<h2>Art  for Ms. Tong, and Visitors Too!</h2>
								<p>Riku woke a little earlier than usual this morning, just before 7 o'clock, but he dashed out to get his new Lego figure and came back to play with it on the bed. I dashed up for a quick shower, while he ate his fruit plate at "his" little desk. When I came downstairs he had drawn most of a Christmas picture for his teacher, Ms. Tong, and finished it off with one of his sparkly pipe cleaners. Lucky her; I did take a photo of it though! Ms. Tong is a noticer and commented on Riku's new hair cut; it does suit him, as it shows off his features better I think. </p>
<p>I forgot to mention yesterday that Riku has been humming and singing "Do Re Mi" since he arrived. At any time at all, morning, noon or night, no matter where he is... at the table, in the car, walking to school, in the tub, out comes "Doe, a deer, a female deer... " and he continues on, right to the end and back 'round again. To make me laugh, he says "Lay, a lemon on a lemon" instead of "Ray, a drop of golden sun". Each time he comes out with his version he looks up to make sure I caught it, and that I am responding to it with a smile. I overheard him telling Gail all about this tonight, when he didn't know I was listening. </p>
<p>Doug went online yesterday afternoon and found a version of Julie Andrews singing it... no picture with it, but you can hear her and the children accompanying her, and singing it so well. It goes on to saying how you can sing any tune at all, once you know those notes. He found the entire sequence quite intriguing, and so Doug now has a DVD copy of "Sound of Music" for us to watch during his five days off school. I can't wait to see his reaction to the story and the music. I love to hear him humming happily and I've heard it a lot lately. </p>
<p>I had all sorts of plans to get some work done before Gail and Tom arrived at 11 A.M. I was going to run the vacuum through this floor, and at least get the books in the living room tidied up. When I realized they were coming in over an hour earlier than I thought, I gave up all thoughts of work and decided to eat breakfast and read the paper. I knew Gail wouldn't care at all if there were some specks on the carpet, and I'm learning to just not stress out about these things. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom came with four big suitcases and two of them had to ride home in the back seat with us. They bought lots of wine which we (mostly Tom and I) will have to drink up during their ten day visit. All the paper work from their trip and treats, and gifts and their clothes filled them all up nicely. Gail and I went off to Rainbow for groceries while Doug and Tom struggled getting the bags up the stairs. </p>
<p>We started unpacking the cases once the groceries were put away, and before long it was time to pick Riku up from school. He was very excited that Auntie Gail and Uncle Tom were going to be here when school ended, and was so happy to see Gail standing outside his classroom! He skipped and chatted all the way home, and Gail told him about holding a koala bear. Later on he told his piano teacher that his aunt and uncle had held polar bears! .. and he had seen a photo of them doing so too! She must have been very impressed! </p>
<p>Riku had only one page of homework to do, and it took him about ten minutes to finish it up. That was all he had to do today, as the piano teacher arrived at 5 P.M. and he read to Auntie Gail after dinner. After his bath, he spent his spare time drawing another picture, this one for Auntie Gail, chatting away with her about various things that interest him, and playing with his Lego sets. It seemed a much shorter afternoon/evening with him tonight; I guess three extra people in our day will do that! Gail and Tom were amazed at his piano playing, and his teacher said he was doing very well. I asked her about the hard piece he had been avoiding playing more than once these past few days, and she said he did well at it! He played it twice before the lesson, so perhaps that did the trick. </p>
<p>I read Riku one of the Bernenstein Bear books, one that he especially likes, because the little bear is actually teaching his dad lots of good lessons, but let's his dad believe he is learning them from him. It appeals to his sense of humour I suppose, and it's clever of him to realize what is going on there. He was sound asleep at 7:45 again tonight. </p>
<p>I had made a mushroom risotto for dinner tonight, and Gail kindly cleared up the pot and kitchen while I tucked him in. We had also been working on the laundry together, as they came home with lots of it, and I had my usual Monday wash to do as well. Once all that was underway again, Gail and I had a game of cards, looked at two photo albums on my computer, and checked out some new photos on the Ancestry site too. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom managed to stay awake until 10:30, despite that long long flight over two days body time, and I'm heading off to bed soon too, after getting the photos up here. </p>
<p>I'm so looking forward to this time with Gail, as she says she will be more than happy to stay home and help me get some things organized around here, chores that are much easier with two of us. I need the inspiration! <br />
