								<h2>A Lazy Morning, a Baker Beach Afternoon, and a Relaxing Evening at 1361</h2>
								<p>This was the best of days for Riku and for me. No rushing about, no plans with a deadline, and a warm sunny November San Francisco day to do with as we pleased. We started our day off as usual with some reading in bed, a very favourite thing to do, and which we rarely miss out on, even on school days. We read another two chapters in the chapter book but stopped at Riku's suggestion so we could finish the book off tonight. </p>
<p>Riku was already busy unpacking his new big Lego set at the table when I joined him in the kitchen after making the bed and tidying up the books. The stack was close to falling over in his room! He told me he liked me joining him at the table while he built, and it is very impressive to watch him slowly and patiently go from one page to another in the long booklet with directions on how to put together the pieces, 333 of them in this particular one. Last night, there were three pieces left over when he finished the plane, and Doug went and checked the book to see where they went. Riku had insisted they were just extra pieces and sure enough, they were! Doug cannot believe how good he is at this, never asking for help with any of it, unless a piece is particularly stiff and hard to fit into another. </p>
<p>I realized yesterday that I wouldn't be able to give Riku his usual breakfast here, day after day after day. Once a week, during his sleepover, is one thing but after a few days I think he will start protesting. So today, instead of oatmeal with finely chopped nuts and mixed berries, I grated in half an apple, added some raisins and sprinkled it with cinnamon after it was cooked, and he just loved it. Uncle Frank did too when I made it for him in the Falls. Today I joined Riku and we both agreed we would have it again. I am going to try cranberries and almonds tomorrow. </p>
<p>Riku worked away at his Lego for at least an hour, and then wrote another of his thank you notes. We read one of the two great books he got from Kelly and family before he did so, though, so that he could draw a picture for them as well. Doug scanned some of his thank you note pictures for me today, as well as a couple of other pictures he drew this week. </p>
<p>We had planned to have a picnic lunch at Ocean Beach, but Doug suggested we try Baker Beach instead, as it is more protected and would be less cold than our usual spot. It's a little bit closer too, and is a beautiful beach, but Riku discovered that it lacks the one thing he loves best about Ocean Beach... shells! There are lots of smooth rocks, but we didn't spot one shell on two long strolls up and down the beach. However, it was lovely to see the Golden Gate bridge, and it was a perfectly wonderful day, with no wind and with much warmer temps that we expected. </p>
<p>I had made tuna sandwiches for lunch, hoping Riku would like them so he could have that as another option for his school lunches. We did have this once at Ocean Beach months ago, and he liked them then too, and today he told me it was "really tasty!" </p>
<p>We had our lunch first and then went exploring. Riku found a tiny jelly fish, or perhaps an egg sack as someone once told us they were, and that provided him with at least an hour of rinsing, probing, and providing a safe place for it on the way home. It was dead and so I gave him permission to bring it home. He had Doug cut it in two, and was a bit disappointed to find it now just looked like two smaller blobs, but it is now outside, in a special container, and will be checked out in the morning, I'm sure. </p>
<p>Riku did a bit more work on his Lego, and then it was time for piano practice. Fifteen minutes after that... another little break, which seems to help, he whipped through five pages of homework, all very simple for him, but not his favourite activity nonetheless. I was so proud of him for just sticking to it and getting it done! Except for one concept that I am not sure of, he is all done his homework for the week, due on Tuesday. Yahoo! We went over his spelling words in the car, but he knows them with nary a hesitation. </p>
<p>Doug was clearing out a tall boy dresser upstairs today and came down several times with "treasures" for Riku... given after two or three magic tricks, which thrilled Riku to bits. He now has a coin Doug pulled out from behind his ear, and some nice little boxes, and a bottle. Doug promised to show Riku some tricks using his magic wand one day, and let Riku hold it too. Wow! Exciting stuff for this six year old. </p>
<p>Riku finished his big Lego project after his bath and dinner, and has his various projects carefully lined up in what he considers "his" room.</p>
<p>He read half of "Sam and the Firefly" to me tonight; it has lots of new words in it, and is a long book, so we shall finish it off tomorrow. </p>
<p>Our bedtime book was the remainder of the "Daddy and the Dragon" book, so I shall try to find another chapter book on our shelves tomorrow. </p>
<p>Riku is very excited that Auntie Gail and Uncle Tom will be here when he gets home from school tomorrow!</p>
