								<h2>A Day at Home</h2>
								<p>Gail decided late last night that, rather than go downtown today, with lunch out, we should stay home and try to finish off as much as we could in the house. We had a lazy morning, eating breakfast with Tom, and playing cards. I mixed up three pounds of butter, Gail cleaned out my fridge, and then I started scanning Riku's pictures into Doug's computer, so that Gail could take her originals home. </p>
<p>Doug came home after his T'ai Chi lesson, had a quick lunch, and then he and Tom headed out to the Nike Missile Battery, something that interested them both. From there they went on to a viewpoint at the Marin headlands (where Doug took a terrific photo of the Golden Gate Bridge), the pet cemetery in the Presidio, the "disappearing" gun and armoury at Baker Beach, and then picked up three pizzas from "Little Star" for us, courtesy of Tom and Gail, for dinner. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gail and I continued on in the house, getting so much done! I was so pleased, as there was no way I could have managed to get so much done on my own. And it is so much more fun to have company doing it all too. Gail did lots of filing for me, and I worked my way through a huge pile of paperwork that Gail had sorted first. These are the jobs I hate to get started at, so having part of it done for me made a world of difference. </p>
<p>We did stop, of course, for a small and easy lunch... hard boiled eggs, a little cheese, and tea, with two games of cards before getting back to it. </p>
<p>Riku had been to his Japanese school in the morning, followed by a birthday party for Nicolo. Mirei, her mom, and her dad were busy in the morning, and attended the party too, after which they dropped Mirei off here, at about 4 P.M. Mirei's first request of the day was to "paint", so paint she did, making some lovely spatters along the edges for the first time. Gail took a nice long shower, after which Mirei happily played with us both, offering us "tea" and goodies.  Bryn took a short nap while all of the above was going on, and then after Riku's homework and piano practice, picked Riku and Akane up to join us for dinner. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom had purchased a few pre-Christmas gifts for the children, and the two containers for Riku, filled with dragons and knights, were a huge hit. Mirei got a pink feathered boa and strutted about with it around her neck before dinner. </p>
<p>Gail and I had prepared a big salad and some extra veggies for Riku, and had the table set, so that when the pizza arrived we were ready to sit down and enjoy it all. Tom and I had wine with our dinner, as we have most nights, and we polished off a plain deep dish pizza as well as a deep dish veggie one, which Gail declared the best pizza she has ever had! And there are leftovers... best of all!</p>
<p>Tom and Doug had the best day and were super enthusiastic about so many aspects of it; we heard all about it during dinner. They spoke with men who were actually part of the Nike missile crews during the cold war, and had many chilling tales to tell about life with atomic weaponry! And they not only got to see the operation of the world's only restored "disappearing gun" (a six-inch cannon that — after firing its shell — retreats into a sunken pit behind a wall), but were actually made a part of the gun crew for one of the loading and "firing" demonstrations.</p>
<p>After dinner there was time to read a few of our Christmas books, now stacked up on the living room coffee table, ready for the season. And we are all, especially Riku I think, looking forward to getting the tree, and start the decorating in the house tomorrow. </p>
<p>Riku was tired after his busy day, as was his sister, and Bryn managed to get them out the door at 7:10 for their usual bedtime routine. Riku had time for some coconut ice cream before leaving, but Mirei took her favourite Devon custard home with her in a container, carefully carried in a bag, all by herself. </p>
<p>Gail, Tom, Doug, and I went upstairs immediately after the last of the tidying, and watched two more of their purchased videos, with some of the highlights of their trip to New Zealand, New Caledonia, Toranga, and other beautiful spots. Gail was almost asleep, so we just had a quick game of cards and a cup of tea... and no more work for tonight, before heading to bed. </p>
