								<h2>BADM, Ocean Beach, and New Year's Resolutions!</h2>
								<p>I've been pondering over New Year's resolutions throughout the day, and there is already quite a list of them. I spoke with Uncle Frank tonight, just past midnight, and he said he hoped he was right at the top of the list and at the bottom too! Of course he is in there for sure; I will drop him at least a line or two every day, as I know how much it means to him... and to me too as he knows he is on my mind.</p>
<p>Another resolution is to keep my blogs much shorter and more succinct; I will try to have a favourite line, or story, or perhaps a memory in each one, as well as the gist of the day's happenings, so here goes for today, just as a trial shot, to see if I can do it. </p>
<p>Bay Area Discovery Museum from 11:30-2 P.M., closing time today. On the way there, Riku came up with a new game after we had played "I Spy" for a while. He had a whole list of questions that all of us got to answer, including Mirei... "what is your favourite colour?", followed bye food, dessert, animal, bird, places to visit, and when he asked us who his favourite person was, he wanted to answer first and touched my heart when he said "Nana". Doug made him laugh when he said he had stolen <strong>his</strong> favourite person! This passed the time so quickly on the drive over the Golden Gate, and it was sweet to listen to Mirei's careful answers too. </p>
<p>Doug and I had such fun with the children at the museum. Doug took Riku off on his own while Mirei and I went into the toddler room; Riku outgrew it a few months ago (he's too tall now), so instead he spent a long time in the indoor fishing boat which he loves. We joined up in time for our outdoor picnic; it was cool sitting in the shade, but much warmer after running around! I sipped a big cup of tea today while Doug did the chasing in and out of the vine maze. Fun for all! </p>
<p>Since it was early, we stopped in at Ocean Beach for an hour. It was a little foggy, but perfect for walking and running, which we did today. These two children love the beach as much as I do, and I am going to see they get as many days there as we can fit into the next two months. </p>
<p>We stopped at Rainbow Groceries for eggs, and the children and I sat in the car while Doug went into the very busy store. I took a fun video of Riku entertaining Mirei.. hilarious! </p>
<p>Home for hot chocolate, with those delicious marshmallows again, some cinnamon toast and pears, and of course the tub, coloured blue today, and with lots of laughs and pretending going on again tonight. </p>
<p>Akane had been to the apartment for most of the afternoon, and we sat down together and fed them dinner... pasta and lots of veggies. They were almost finished when Ayako and Masu walked in, and after finishing up their meals, they were off to play and have fun with them. Riku and Ayako played a board game, with Mirei joining in, and doing very well at finding the right clues! </p>
<p>Riku wanted Ayako to floss his teeth tonight (usually I do it, and so gave her a one tooth demonstration!) and then he sat on his bed with his aunt and uncle and read two stories, with the door shut for complete privacy. He will miss them when they go, as will Mirei. </p>
<p>Riku had a little trouble falling into a deep sleep tonight, and just when I thought he had, he rolled over, whispered "Nana?", and when I answered asked me "Is the brain a muscle?" One wonders what else these little ones think about! </p>
<p>Bryn, Akane, Ayako, and Masu left about 8:30 for dinner out followed by some evening New Year's celebrations in the city, with Mari as well. I was still in with Riku when they left, but was out his door soon after. </p>
<p>Mirei woke up at 10, calling and crying for her mom, and it took me about ten minutes of more to settle her down. </p>
<p>Kelly called, I called Bryn and Caillie at their Dad's, and then called Uncle Frank to wish him a Happy New Year's too! </p>
