								<h2> No "Nutcracker", House Guests, and a Busy Day</h2>
								<p>This was an exciting day for the children especially, as Ayako and Masu, Akane's sister and brother-in-law arrived here at 11 A.M. from Japan this morning. Riku went with his parents to pick them up, leaving a crying Mirei behind them.</p>
<p>However, they came bearing gifts and after all of that excitement  she was off to Chinatown with them and her parents for noodles and some fresh air walking around. It was a gorgeous sunny day here, much milder than it has been for a few days, so a nice way for them to start off their visit here. </p>
<p>My geraniums and daisies continue to bloom on the front steps. It is really lovely and mild today!</p>
<p>Riku and I thought we were going to see "The Nutcracker Suite" this afternoon. Riku was not all that excited about it, much to my disappointment, but of course he really wanted to be with his aunt and uncle. </p>
<p>Doug dropped us off and Riku was delighted with the fake "snow" they had falling outside the opera house. However, after all of this, it turned out that our tickets were for tomorrow! Riku could have joined them for lunch after all, although I guess there wouldn't have been room for them all in the car. </p>
<p>Riku and I decided we would take the bus to Ghiardelli Square; it is beautifully decorated and we just wandered about a bit, deciding to have a hot fudge sundae for a special treat at "Cold Stone Creamery". The idea was very appealing to Riku, and so I let him eat his full, which didn't take long at all. He just does not have a sweet tooth, and I was awfully glad we bought a small size as I got to eat most of it. Riku enjoyed those first few bites though! </p>
<p>We caught the bus home too, and both watched with interest a very interesting group of people on the bus with us. Riku had lots of questions about what was going on with them. The conversations were interesting, but everyone was very nice and behaving well, but since one was a very obvious man, dressed like a woman, Riku was especially intrigued. </p>
<p>We had some quiet time at home before the evening plans got underway so I asked Riku if he would like to make some gingerbread cookies. The dough was all ready. Mirei had helped make some up the other day, and so a happy boy helped me roll out the dough but loved being able to do all the decorating on his own, making eyes, mouths, and buttons as well as cutting the marks for the hands, feet, and belt line. I think it made up for not being with Ayako and Masu. </p>
<p>We all met up for dinner at "Little Star" pizzeria at 5:30, expecting that it would be busy. It was so crowded even at that early hour and we had to wait a while for the pizza; I would have preferred to eat at home, but once we were served, it felt very festive and we all enjoyed it very much. </p>
<p>The children were ready for bed by the time we got home, as were Ayako and Masu. Doug and Bryn went off to see a Clint Eastwood movie. Akane didn't appear for the rest of the night, so she obviously fell asleep with Mirei. </p>
<p>It was certainly a very long busy day for our houseguests, as they stepped off the plane at 11 a.m., after an eleven hour flight, and with a seventeen hour time difference.</p>
<p>It is tempting to go to bed myself although it's early for me, and I have emails to write, and photos to annotate, and things to do around here before turning in... and I do have the house to myself which is rare these days. Now there are ten of us in the house, so the next while will be very busy indeed. </p>
