								<h2>Don't Stop the Fun!</h2>
								<p>This has been the busiest day!  Akane's sister and brother-in-law, Masu, were planning to spend the next two nights in a hotel downtown, and Riku was mighty upset when he learned about this. He was so disappointed and wanted to know, from me, why they couldn't just stay here, so he could see them and play with them. Of course I explained that they probably just wanted some privacy and some time downtown without taking buses every day, but it's all beyond his understanding.</p>
<p> I told Akane how upset he was, and she suggested they spend some time with the children this morning before leaving. They did this, but was my house bedlam! Riku was hot and sweating with the exertion of chasing Aya-chan around and around the house, and with Mirei right in there trying to get involved too, and the squeals from all three of them!... man, oh man! </p>
<p>They did have a little quiet time at the table, as both Ayako and Masu have little hand held gadgets one can play games on, and lots of other stuff too. There is even a little special "pen" to use with them, and that held their attention until the chasing started. Masu kept sneaking away into the bedroom to sleep some more, but that didn't last long! No doubt that is part of the reason they are heading downtown for two days. These two are not used to having their sleep broken so early or so often. </p>
<p>Riku had his piano lesson today at noon, so that meant they had to slow down a bit. All that energy could have lit up the town for a day! Akake made a big lunch for them of steamed broccoli, rice, and egg, and after they left for downtown. Not much later Akane left to join them, and I took the children off to a playground almost two hours. I so much more enjoy seeing all that steam let off outside! </p>
<p>I got to talk to a lovely grandmother from Brooklyn, who was at the playground with her grown daughter and son, and a five and three quarters year old grandson, happily playing with the visiting uncle. Riku got to join in their ball throwing fun, and after some chatting, we found out that both our grandchildren attend the Mandarin Chinese Immersion program at Starr King School... her little guy, Cosmo, is in the kindergarten class. They played so well together, tossing a ball back and forth to each other from various high points on the slides and the play structure. </p>
<p>Mirei and Riku had some time together too though; they sat in the sand and dug, and Riku pushed Mirei on the swing, something they both enjoyed so much. It's obvious that Riku likes being a big brother and it's very sweet to see. Mirei would tell him when to push her higher and when to slow down and he listened to her. </p>
<p>Mirei watched in admiration as Riku drew his name in Chinese on the sidewalk with chalk. I'm sure she will be trying to print her name very soon too!</p>
<p>It was a gorgeous day and the children shed their jackets. Nice to be wearing just shirts in the sunshine at the end of the year, and getting outside was so good for all of us. It's what we all needed after such a busy time lately.</p>
<p>I popped both children in the tub when we got home, made a big pot of pasta for dinner, and they were both sound asleep at 7:15 tonight. They so needed an early night, as while we have company they are all sleeping in one room .. in twin beds pushed together. The minute Mirei or Riku stirs in the morning, sometimes at 5:30(!) that is it for both of them. </p>
<p>Riku will have two good nights sleep in his regular small dark room, before his aunt and uncle are back. The children are so enjoying having company in the house and just don't want the fun to stop! </p>
<p>I did connect with a fellow doula today about a pregnant mom due soon, wanting to have a doula with her for her birth. I hope it's in the cards for me to be available for her, but we shall see. </p>
<p>Bed earlier than usual tonight, just in case the children do wake up early again. </p>
