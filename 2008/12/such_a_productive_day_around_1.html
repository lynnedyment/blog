								<h2>Such a Productive Day Around 1361 Rhode Island Street!</h2>
								<p>Well, days without children are much quieter days than is ideal, but the plus side is that with my sister here, we accomplished so much, and had fun doing so. Being raised in a big family, where everyone worked together, or at least were all working at the same time on household chores, spoiled me forever for having to do boring household chores on my own. I know what needs to be done, I make lists, I go to bed knowing what I am going to do first, and then each night wonder how the day passed without a thing on that list being done! </p>
<p>With Gail here to help and spur me on, we managed together to do a thorough cleaning and clearing out of the downstairs bathroom. The walls got washed, the medicine cabinet emptied for Akane's and Bryn's toiletries, and the knickknacks put away, making room for Christmas decorations. I packed up a big box of stuff collected last night from the shelves in the dining room, and perhaps by the time I get them back up in the spring, after Bryn and family have moved to Japan, and after Kelly and Gregg's wedding, I may be less enamoured of all these mementos and be able to part with some of them.  </p>
<p>We took all the birds, wooden pieces, shells, rocks, etc. off the kitchen bookshelves, and pulled all the books to the very front edge of the shelves, leaving room for no dust collecting! The white board above the children's desk in the kitchen is now white, and no longer covered with the alphabet and the days of the week. The two doors off the kitchen are ready for Christmas-related pictures, replacing the paintings done over the past few months by the children. </p>
<p>Another "big" project, which isn't nearly as big with two hard-working women dealing with it, was a complete clean-out of the laundry room, aka the children's overflow toy area. I went through a big basket of toys and found plenty to give away to the Prenatal Homeless Shelter. Some items were listed on Freecycle as well. Doug and Tom took three bags from the previous days clean-out to Goodwill, and I have another stack to take out when we are out in that area next. Yahoo! </p>
<p>I'm working on the closets in the two downstairs bedrooms too, and managed to clear some of my clothes out of one, and find room for them upstairs where they really belong anyway. Now if I could just convince Doug to clear out some suits and shirts, we would be in great shape! </p>
<p>Susan stopped by to return fondue pots, and went away with a nice big bag of shoes for Finn, outgrown by Riku, but still in fine shape. And since Susan loves overalls on Finn, she took some of those too, leaving plenty of other outfits for one of my doula moms with three boys. It will be such fun to see Finn in these clothes of Riku's; I have such a hard time parting with clothes I can remember the children wearing. </p>
<p>At 2:30, Gail and I took a break and walked to the school to pick Riku up. Today was a gorgeous day, sunny and warm, and we didn't really need the jackets we wore at all. How I love holding hands with that little boy, as he skips along and fills me in on his day. He and Gail held hands as he walked along a very narrow ledge near the hospital, so he could be "Spiderman" and "walk" on the bit of wall around the poles. It was very cute to see! </p>
<p>We went to the garden area of the hospital while Riku had his snack, and we chatted about school; he found some ants to feed too and gave them a bit of bread. I had taken his Advent calendar with me, and he was very pleased to have that tiny bit of chocolate hidden behind door number 2. He had a quick runaround on the big sculpture before he came running for the last few minutes of the walk around the corner to home. </p>
<p>Mirei had gone to her Japanese nursery school program today, and I was surprised to hear that Akane got home without her falling asleep on the bus. She was sound asleep, though, when we walked in at 3:40 P.M. Jet-lagged girl; she had been awake for two hours in the night, from 1-3, and so I wasn't surprised to learn that she had finally just given in. She looked so long and lean sleeping on the big bed; I hope the waking was easy for her, and her night time tuck-in easier still. </p>
<p>Riku took a few minutes to show me his new toy from Japan; he turned a wheel into a robot in just minutes and it really is as cool as he told me it was on the phone last night. </p>
<p>I called Uncle Frank tonight, as it was Auntie Rita's birthday today, and I knew he would be having a very difficult day. He had indeed, and has had a few tough days before this too. He was alone for Thanksgiving dinner, and added to the not too long ago fifth "anniversary" of Auntie Rita's passing, it all adds up to a most distressing season for Uncle Frank. We chatted for a long time though, and shared some laughs, catching up on both sides of the continent. I am so glad I called, and wish during tough times like this for him that I lived closer.</p>
<p>We waited to have dinner with Doug, after his T'ai Chi lesson, and he really enjoyed the "hamburger" stew Gail and I made, as did Tom and the cooks too. Lots of onion, carrots, celery, peas, and corn in gravy, served over mashed potatoes. Yum! It reminds Gail and me of Mom and home, as it was a favourite dish of ours way back then too. Tom and I finished off a bottle of wine with a generous glass each, and after a little more kitchen work, we all went upstairs to watch the first of four videos of Gail's and Tom's six week cruise. Their ship was just beautiful, much more elegant than I imagined a cruise ship to be! It was such fun watching as this was a professionally made video which they bought, and we saw them three times during the hour plus movie! </p>
<p>Gail and I had one last game of cards, off to bed she went at 10:15, and now it's my turn, an hour later. </p>
