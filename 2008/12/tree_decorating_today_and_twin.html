								<h2>Tree Decorating Today, and Twinnie and Winnie Moved In!</h2>
								<p>Today is the day Riku and I especially have been waiting for, the chance to decorate this year's tree together, with the whole family. We've had lights and the garland on up to now, looking gorgeous, but not it's time for all those old treasures to come out of the boxes. To make it even more special for me this year, Bryn has donated the wonderful old ornaments he bought on EBay last year, which I admit I coveted. </p>
<p>I came downstairs early, before 7, to find so many comments on all the old photos I posted on Facebook last night. Bryn, Myk', Kelly, Carol and others wrote to tell me which ones were their favourites, or that they hadn't seen before. So, that was very satisfying as it took a lot of time to do them last night, when I should have been wrapping gifts or writing cards! </p>
<p>Riku was disappointed when Doug ate the last piece of pumpkin pie over the Thanksgiving weekend, and I decided before drifting off to sleep last night that I would make pumpkin muffins for him this morning. I had those fresh out of the oven when Bryn came by with Riku, leaving Mirei to eat the rest of her breakfast at home with her mom. </p>
<p>Riku was willing to sit down and make a birthday card for Tomoha's sixth birthday. I was very pleased as she drew one for him too, and I know she will be thrilled to have one from Riku too. These two children are unlikely to see each other again, but her Mom and I are in touch so perhaps we can at least keep them connected in some small way as well. He did a careful job with it, choosing stickers and even drawing a butterfly on the upper part of the card. </p>
<p>And by the time he finished and we had started putting the decorations out, Bryn was back with Mirei and Akane. Riku was so anxious for everyone to be in there at once, placing ornaments, but it was a little crowded! Mirei was right there too, so wanting to hang the pieces she selected, but often having trouble placing them on the tree so they stayed. Riku was very patient with her, and would put hooks on for her, and suggest places for her to hang them. Riku was climbing up and down from two chairs to get his in different areas of the tree, and carefully put lots of the brass ornaments from his Dad's childhood on the back of the tree, so that "people outside can see pretty things too." </p>
<p>Akane made tea and she, Bryn, and Riku really liked the muffins, as did Doug. I was worried that I had made too big a batch, but I could see that wasn't going to be a problem after all! Riku and I ended up working on the tree on our own towards the end of the morning, and he was anxious that every decoration on the table not be left out. We left off at 11:15 to make lunch for the children, and I plan on doing those special decorations on my own later on. This is such a full lush tree that I think I might get them all on. Still to come... the icicles, but Riku and Mirei may want to help with those later in the week. </p>
<p>Pasta for lunch went down well, as Riku has a bad cold with infected sinuses, and Mirei is snuggling and stuffy too. Mirei's appetite is not quite back to normal for her, but she did better than Akane and I expected her too. </p>
<p>Immediately after lunch, both children played together by pulling the duvet off the bed in the little bedroom and curling up with all the children's blankets from the drawer, and playing there and in the living room. They had such fun together, and there wasn't one moment that wasn't just plain fun for both of them. They dragged out a few animals too, and at one point I saw and heard Riku talking with one of them saying he was the daddy, and Mirei piped up that she was the mommy. On and on it went... lovely to see. </p>
<p>Riku was to have gone to "Peter and the Wolf" with Berne, from Bryn's office leaving here at noon, but she hadn't bought the tickets and it turned out they were sold out when she tried to buy them today. Riku seemed a little concerned about going out with her on their own, once he heard this news, and asked me if one adult after another, or Mirei, could go with them. However, we all have plans... Doug and I were going to a movie, Bryn had to work and Mirei needed a nap at home. He was assured he would have fun and he did indeed. Riku kissed me several times, waved goodbye from the front porch about four times, and blew kisses to me as we pulled away. </p>
<p>Doug and I saw two great movies... a Czech film called "Beauty and Trouble" followed by "The Boy in Striped Pajamas", a movie about the Holocaust and difficult to end the afternoon with such a depressing story. It was so well acted, and moved along at a fast pace though, and I was glad I saw it. </p>
<p>We stopped for groceries on the way home in the pouring rain; our winter rains have arrived at last, and we're all happy to see it after two years of near-drought conditions. </p>
<p>I called Riku to see how his day had gone, and even though I didn't get all the details, I found a little fish tank on my microwave with two goldfish in it! Berne bought them for him and when they move to Japan, she will house them. Riku was thrilled to bits about it, told me I had to feed them every day, but we decided that once he moved in that it would be his job. Their names... Twinnie and Winnie.</p>
<p>Caillie had also left a sweet message on our machine, wondering how our gingerbread making had gone... it hadn't!, and to say goodnight. I am loving these calls from her, usually while she's at her Dad's, saying a short goodnight to me. She told me she would call tomorrow and I'm sure she will. </p>
<p>Light dinner at home, Doug upstairs to watch a two hour program, and I read the morning paper, tidied up, wrote a few emails and sorted through photos for my latest blogs.  Bed at 11 P.M. tonight after a 1:45 A.M. lights out last night. </p>
