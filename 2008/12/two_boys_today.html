								<h2>Two Boys Today... and a Sick Girl</h2>
								<p>Wednesday and Friday mornings are my loosely scheduled day with Finn, although "life" interferes often enough that it doesn't always happen. Sometimes he hasn't slept enough and needs an early morning nap at home with his mom, or sometimes something comes up here that interferes, but I try hard to see Finn on these days if at all possible. He's changing fast, and I know how precious these early days are. </p>
<p>Susan wasn't sure today would work for us, as he was quite sick on the weekend, and had had a high fever over those two days. But they came over after all, and Finn was his usual sweet self, if a bit pale and listless. I think a change is good when little ones aren't feeling well, and it gave his mom a chance to run some errands too.</p>
<p>Finn is a Grandpa's boy when he is well, but today he lifted his arms for me to hold him, and would nestle against me for a minute before asking to get down. This happened perhaps six times over the course of the morning, and it was a treat to have this extra little snuggle with him. </p>
<p>It was too chilly to go outside, but the Christmas lights and the little "singing" Christmas villagefrom Beth, kept him occupied for quite a long time. He kept making the sign for "more", asking me to clap to turn the music on for him. It was the sweetest thing to watch, and he was delighted when he managed to clap loudly enough to have the music come on for him! </p>
<p>Much to my surprise, Finn ate a poached egg with dry toast, and drank lots of orange juice as well. He does tend to eat well here, although I wasn't expecting him today after his rough weekend. </p>
<p>He had a great time playing with the magnetic stacking truck toy; Finn loves it when the pieces all fall down, of course, and joined me in the chorus of "Oh no"s each and every time that happened. He got quite a chuckle out of it! </p>
<p>Finn loves to take apart the toy kitchen stove bits, emptying the drawers of the "silverware" and the shelves of the plastic dishware. After that has been pulled apart it's time to start in on the big basket that holds all sorts of play goodies. Today before we left the kitchen I asked him to help me pick them all up. "NO!" was his instant reply, but I gently convinced him  by singing "Clean up, clean up, everybody everywhere.... " and soon he was humming along with me <strong>AND</strong> putting things in the basket with me.</p>
<p>Akane arrived to bake a banana bread for a pot luck luncheon tomorrow at one of the mom's home from Mirei's nursery school. She had made one a couple of years ago for the first time, so got busy with that. </p>
<p>Finn loves being read to these days, and I asked if he would like to sit on the sofa with me and read. He gave a big smile and off he went, pulling himself up and plopping himself down beside me. We went through a nice stack of them, and were reading an especially favourite one of Riku's and Mirei's... a pop-up Christmas story about a little mouse, when Susan arrived. She felt he needed an early nap today, so it was wasn't long after 11:30 after nursing, that they waved goodbye.  </p>
<p>Akane left around noon hour with the banana bread baking in the oven, and smelling oh-so-good within twenty minutes. </p>
<p>I picked Riku up at 2:40. We didn't decorate the tree as we had planned to after all. Instead we watched "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" (the Burl Ives version),  as he loves the story and the songs. It was a cozy Christmasy thing to do, snacking on gingerbread cookies and fruit in the bedroom, snuggled together enjoying the movie. </p>
<p>Then we headed downstairs and drew a lovely Christmas picture. He did a little fine tuning on the mantle, something he enjoys doing very much, moving these just a little bit this way and that. </p>
<p>While I made dinner, he had his tub, we ate dinner, and before we knew it, it was tuck-in time. He was sound asleep at 7:45. That bit of time with him goes by far too quickly! </p>
<p>Bryn IMd me about 10 to say that Mirei had thrown up for the first time in her life. It went through all her bedding on her own bed, and a half hour later she threw up in their big bed. He was here before 11P.M. with all the bedding and put the first load in. I will do the rest tomorrow. Poor wee girl. Hope she feels better tomorrow! </p>
