								<h2>Christmas Eve!</h2>
								<p>Well, here we are with another beautiful Christmas Eve upon us, and now almost over. The children and I had a lovely quiet morning here together, which started in the nicest way possible. Riku arrived upstairs with a peeled mandarin orange for me, which he had prepared himself. He was still in his jammies, and it was such a sweet thing for him to do. </p>
<p>Gail sent a beautiful e-card to me today and I sat with both children on my lap, so they could see it at the same time. It was lovely, in "book" form, so that I had to use the mouse to "turn" the pages. They both sat enthralled, watching and listening to me read it, page by page. A lovely moment in this special day.</p>
<p>I had a long chat this morning with Uncle Frank, while the children were busy with dolls and blankets. He was looking forward to the annual Christmas Eve dinner at Beth's tonight; she will be busy preparing a big meal for lots of folks today! Glenn and Wendy will pick up Uncle Frank this afternoon, and I believe Neal will be with them too. </p>
<p>Akane and Doug went out with lists in hand to do the grocery shopping at Rainbow Grocery for tomorrow's dinner. I happily stayed home with the children; I knew the store would be crowded, and that it would be much more fun to sit and read stories and chat with the children about tomorrow. How I love our tradition of cheese fondue for Christmas Eve dinner, as there is very little prep' work to be done for it, and it can be easily prepared in just a few minutes tomorrow. </p>
<p>During the early afternoon I even cut out the sugar cookies, but didn't get the dough made for the striped red and green cookies I thought the children would enjoy. I was sure the children would want to help me with the cookie cutting but they have made lots of gingerbread men already, and were very happy playing in Riku's room. They had pulled the comforter up to make a nice cozy spot for playing "family" ... having lots of fun. </p>
<p>At one point, Mirei came running in asking for "a piece of paper, please, and a pencil" and went running in to Riku saying "Here you go, Doctor." so I guess someone was ill! </p>
<p>They are, of course, very excited that Christmas is tomorrow. They so enjoyed seeing Santa yesterday and once in a while I could hear them talking about him, and the reindeer and how they can fly.  </p>
<p>We had a fairly early dinner, I bathed the children and got them into their PJs, and ready for our usual Christmas Eve routine of photos under the tree, getting Santa's tray ready, hanging the stockings, and then of course reading "The Night Before Christmas", the same copy that was read to Doug as a child, then to our children, and Bryn and Caillie too. We are now at the third generation for this book and this routine and I hope all of the children continue with it for many years more. Mirei was very relaxed and sleepy, more than ready for bed, and kept lolling over on Doug's shoulder during the reading. </p>
<p>Interestingly, Riku asked if both Daddy and Grandpa could read it to them, and so they read every other page. Traditions are alive and well at our home!</p>
<p>Despite not getting all our cards written this year, I am feeling very organized. While Doug and Bryn spread the presents out under the tree, I had a cup of hot chocolate, read the paper, and enjoyed watching the stack of gifts growing under the beautiful big tree. </p>
<p>I'm happy to be here with Riku and Mirei, as they have too have grown to love every aspect of the Christmas they are now accustomed to.It may well be their last one, although I like to think that one or two years while the children are young, they could perhaps spend Christmas here again. This date in Japan will be very different, with perhaps no gingerbread cookies, but I do hope they will have a tree, with lights, icicles, and all the decorations they remember and enjoy hanging. It will be a new and different Christmas for them, and I hope they remember the best parts of each. </p>
<p>Each moment this season is bittersweet, as we are into so many "last times", and it will continue this way until they leave in March. </p>
<p>Bed at midnight... </p>
