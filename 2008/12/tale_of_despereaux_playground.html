								<h2>"Tale of Despereaux", Playground and Trail Time, Tub and Noodles!</h2>
								<p>I had told Riku last night that he could come upstairs quietly when he woke, and waken me, as we haven't had morning time together for a few days... or at least not snuggle time. I had just opened my eyes at 7:15 and in he walked, all smiles and ready to get in and put his cold feet on my warm legs! After they were warmed up, I came downstairs to get a fruit bowl ready for him and showered after putting Caillou on the TV. When I came out Mirei was sitting there with him too, still in her pink sleepers, with pink cheeks and a happy smile. Lucky me! </p>
<p>It had just finished... "just at the right time!" said Riku, and down we all came for breakfast. Akane and I sat with them while they ate, and of course there was drawing time for Riku, and Play-Doh time for Mirei too. We were going off to the movies at 11 A.M. so Riku got his piano lesson over with first, which works much better for him than at the end of a busy day. He wasn't happy today about getting at it, but Akane says he does so well and always ends up enjoying it. </p>
<p>I packed up snacks for the movie and at 11:15, Doug, Riku, Mirei and I were sitting in the theatre in Daly City, nibbling on popcorn (not Riku who ate grapes and gingerbread instead),  We all thoroughly enjoyed the movie, with lots of laughs from Riku, and Mirei whispering quietly when she had a question. This was her first movie experience and she was just great; I think about 15% of the time she was very interested in looking at the people beside and behind us, and staring around the theatre, especially at the projector room. Mirei ate one kernel of popcorn at a time, every so daintily, and then had gingerbread cookies for "dessert". They were both given free t-shirts with a picture of the darling big eared mouse on the front too; I think they will fit when they are in their teens! </p>
<p>I thought some running around time after all that sitting was a good idea, and so I had Doug drop us off at a local Potrero Hill playground. He ran an errand and joined us perhaps an hour later, leaving us lots of time for tag (whenever I was close to catching Riku, he found a spot quickly and claimed it as "base!"). All three of us were running, taking turns being it, and having lots of fun. Riku pushed Mirei on the swing, he played on a hopscotch, and we stopped for a picnic snack in a sunny spot for oranges, grapes, and some water. When Doug joined us, we went for a little walk along a dirt trail, and how I loved seeing those two little ones holding hands as they walked along, or following along behind Grandpa carrying their sticks. </p>
<p>Surprisingly to me, once back home, instead of instantly wanting to have hot chocolate... it was cool today!, both children headed to the back yard. Mirei came in asking for the "poppers" that bang, and that kept them busy for a bit, distracting Riku from sweeping the yard, which needed the attention! </p>
<p>A half hour later they came in for hot chocolate with special vanilla marshmallows, and gingerbread cookies, followed by a tub coloured pink today, with lots of play-acting going on between these two. For the entire time, Mirei was the "mommy" and Riku the "baby", and he went along with it all. I could hear him "crying" and her consoling him, and when I walked in I found Mirei with a face cloth on his head and washing his face with another! It was hilarious to listen to, and to photograph! They had such fun. One of the things I think is funny and endearing is that whenever one of them gets water in their eyes, they ask for a "safe cloth". Riku apparently misheard "facecloth" many years ago, and Mirei has picked up on it too. I have told them both it is called a facecloth, but I must say for their use and "safecloth" is more apt a description! Following that, Riku happily sat and did two and a half pages of homework, which he whizzed through while Mirei sat beside him drawing. She is now making easily recognizable As, Ms, and Ns, and proudly announces that she has done her homework.</p>
<p>Bryn heard her saying she was doing a project two days ago, except she was saying "projec'", so he carefully repeated the word to her adding a very distinct "t" sound to the end of it. So for the moment "project" has become "projec...T"! It's pretty cute to hear this coming out of this just turned three year old! </p>
<p>Another recent addition to Mirei's vocabulary comes from the Dyment side of the family for sure... "actually". It turns out some of us say it a lot, and Mirei is now using it frequently. I will ask her if she would like juice or milk, she tells me her choice, and then instantly says "Actually, I will have... instead." I remember so well the first time I heard Caillie say this word and can repeat it to this day. She was caught by a five or six year old putting pink icing on her hands, and was told it was for the cookies. Caillie, at about three and five months said "Actually Emma, this is nail polish." and I just laughed so hard and will never forget it. I even have photos of the event. So, it's such fun to have Mirei saying this word so early too. </p>
<p>Akane came home from the apartment and made big bowls of udon noodles with veggies for their dinner, and they both ate it all, much to my surprise! It always looks like such a big portion for these children, but they love it. However, Mirei tonight decided she didn't like cabbage after all, but had no problem at all with the big mushrooms in her bowl. </p>
<p>Tuck in time was early again tonight, with both children asleep by 7:45. I worked on the Christmas Day album and can't wait to get caught up with the other two on the agenda! </p>
