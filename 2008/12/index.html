								<h2><a href="/2008/12/akane_bryn_and_mirei_arrive_ho.html">Akane, Bryn, and Mirei Arrive Home</a></h2>
								<p>Riku was a very excited boy this morning. The first words out of his mouth were "Nana, I love you. Today Mommy, and Daddy, and Mirei are coming home!" We read four short Shel Silverstein poems and then he was up and ready to draw a picture at the table. I put his fruit plate in front of him, and went up to shower, and Gail sat with him while he ate his breakfast and I made his lunch. </p>
<p>It's the first of December, and I gave Riku his Advent calendar. He was very happy to see a small piece of chocolate behind the first door, shaped like a Christmas tree. We walked up to school at the usual time, and took a few minutes to realize that today is the day the children gather in the schoolyard for Monday morning assembly. I waved goodbye after walking him to his room, and came home to have an egg and sourdough toast breakfast with Gail and Tom, get the laundry going, Riku's bed stripped, etc. etc. </p>
<p>Gail and I also played a few games of morning cards, something we have not done since she arrived and then Gail vacuumed this entire floor thoroughly, making it look so much better! There are bags in the hallway downstairs waiting to be distributed to various places; how I love seeing things moving out of this house. </p>
<p>Glenn called on Skype as well, and sounds just awful, as he has a terrible cough and most likely has picked up a bug that is going 'round the Falls.  </p>
<p>The doorbell rang about noon hour, and there was Bryn with a little girl, peering in my front window. I got a huge hug and big smiles from her, and then she was dashing up the stairs to see Auntie Gail and Uncle Tom. Grandpa had picked her up at the airport and got his big hugs there. Mirei immediately got busy with the little kitchen, making us "tea" and "breakfast", and then settled in at the table to play with her pretend birthday cake, serving us large slices while we all sang the birthday song a half dozen times. She ate a nice big real lunch and then she too took much delight in finding a chocolate behind the door in her Advent calendar. </p>
<p>Gail, Mirei, and I walked up to the school to meet Riku, and what big smiles and big hugs she got from her brother. His little face just lit up when he saw her and he held hands with her all the way home, telling her about the movie he saw, and pointing out BM on the sidewalk, and chatting up a storm, stopping now and then to cup her face in his hands, or just look at her. It was just adorable. </p>
<p>Back here the two of them cuddled up in the bedding on the floor of the small bedroom, looked through books together, smiled and read to each other, played out in the garden, and went upstairs with some of the stuffed animals. They both had snacks, which included a tiny chocolate bar for Riku from his Hallowe'en stash. As soon as he finished it though, he started grabbing at his throat and making loud clearing sounds, asking me for something to eat because his throat was bothering him. Now we really do think he has an allergy to peanuts as that was listed as an ingredient on the wrapper. I instantly gave him an antihistamine, and let Bryn know what had happened. We will get him to a skin specialist asap to see what is going on, as he has had quite a fine rash on his legs and torso over the past few days, so there may be other food allergies as well. I'm sure he will be getting tested soon, so we know what to he needs to avoid. </p>
<p>We all walked to Hampshire Street at 4:30, although the tablet by that time had made Riku dozy and a little edgy, so he wasn't thrilled about walking home, something he never objects to. However, Doug and Tom were at the Hiller Aeronautical Museum with the car, so we had no choice. We met Akane almost at the corner of Potrero Avenue, and all walked to the house together. She got a big hug too, and later I spoke to him on the phone and found out he had a very successful piano lesson, and was very happy with his new toy, a wheel that turns into a robot!</p>
<p>Tom and Doug were home shortly after we walked in the door, so we had a quick dinner and then dashed off to Costco. Back at home Gail and I had tea, a few games of cards, and then Bryn walked in with a visit and some gifts for us... tea and food goodies for Gail and me, chocolates and biscuits for Doug and some canned beer for Tom. We heard a little bit about their trip including the story of Mirei dashing out to play at recess with the children at what will be her new French immersion daycare in Kyoto. </p>
<p>We had planned to get some extra work done in the house, but both Gail and I were too tired to do much. I started collecting up all the chickens and knickknacks from the living room and the front bedroom, in anticipation of Bryn and family moving in, and Christmas decorating, coming soon! We had a last game of cards and went off to bed.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/such_a_productive_day_around_1.html">Such a Productive Day Around 1361 Rhode Island Street!</a></h2>
								<p>Well, days without children are much quieter days than is ideal, but the plus side is that with my sister here, we accomplished so much, and had fun doing so. Being raised in a big family, where everyone worked together, or at least were all working at the same time on household chores, spoiled me forever for having to do boring household chores on my own. I know what needs to be done, I make lists, I go to bed knowing what I am going to do first, and then each night wonder how the day passed without a thing on that list being done! </p>
<p>With Gail here to help and spur me on, we managed together to do a thorough cleaning and clearing out of the downstairs bathroom. The walls got washed, the medicine cabinet emptied for Akane's and Bryn's toiletries, and the knickknacks put away, making room for Christmas decorations. I packed up a big box of stuff collected last night from the shelves in the dining room, and perhaps by the time I get them back up in the spring, after Bryn and family have moved to Japan, and after Kelly and Gregg's wedding, I may be less enamoured of all these mementos and be able to part with some of them.  </p>
<p>We took all the birds, wooden pieces, shells, rocks, etc. off the kitchen bookshelves, and pulled all the books to the very front edge of the shelves, leaving room for no dust collecting! The white board above the children's desk in the kitchen is now white, and no longer covered with the alphabet and the days of the week. The two doors off the kitchen are ready for Christmas-related pictures, replacing the paintings done over the past few months by the children. </p>
<p>Another "big" project, which isn't nearly as big with two hard-working women dealing with it, was a complete clean-out of the laundry room, aka the children's overflow toy area. I went through a big basket of toys and found plenty to give away to the Prenatal Homeless Shelter. Some items were listed on Freecycle as well. Doug and Tom took three bags from the previous days clean-out to Goodwill, and I have another stack to take out when we are out in that area next. Yahoo! </p>
<p>I'm working on the closets in the two downstairs bedrooms too, and managed to clear some of my clothes out of one, and find room for them upstairs where they really belong anyway. Now if I could just convince Doug to clear out some suits and shirts, we would be in great shape! </p>
<p>Susan stopped by to return fondue pots, and went away with a nice big bag of shoes for Finn, outgrown by Riku, but still in fine shape. And since Susan loves overalls on Finn, she took some of those too, leaving plenty of other outfits for one of my doula moms with three boys. It will be such fun to see Finn in these clothes of Riku's; I have such a hard time parting with clothes I can remember the children wearing. </p>
<p>At 2:30, Gail and I took a break and walked to the school to pick Riku up. Today was a gorgeous day, sunny and warm, and we didn't really need the jackets we wore at all. How I love holding hands with that little boy, as he skips along and fills me in on his day. He and Gail held hands as he walked along a very narrow ledge near the hospital, so he could be "Spiderman" and "walk" on the bit of wall around the poles. It was very cute to see! </p>
<p>We went to the garden area of the hospital while Riku had his snack, and we chatted about school; he found some ants to feed too and gave them a bit of bread. I had taken his Advent calendar with me, and he was very pleased to have that tiny bit of chocolate hidden behind door number 2. He had a quick runaround on the big sculpture before he came running for the last few minutes of the walk around the corner to home. </p>
<p>Mirei had gone to her Japanese nursery school program today, and I was surprised to hear that Akane got home without her falling asleep on the bus. She was sound asleep, though, when we walked in at 3:40 P.M. Jet-lagged girl; she had been awake for two hours in the night, from 1-3, and so I wasn't surprised to learn that she had finally just given in. She looked so long and lean sleeping on the big bed; I hope the waking was easy for her, and her night time tuck-in easier still. </p>
<p>Riku took a few minutes to show me his new toy from Japan; he turned a wheel into a robot in just minutes and it really is as cool as he told me it was on the phone last night. </p>
<p>I called Uncle Frank tonight, as it was Auntie Rita's birthday today, and I knew he would be having a very difficult day. He had indeed, and has had a few tough days before this too. He was alone for Thanksgiving dinner, and added to the not too long ago fifth "anniversary" of Auntie Rita's passing, it all adds up to a most distressing season for Uncle Frank. We chatted for a long time though, and shared some laughs, catching up on both sides of the continent. I am so glad I called, and wish during tough times like this for him that I lived closer.</p>
<p>We waited to have dinner with Doug, after his T'ai Chi lesson, and he really enjoyed the "hamburger" stew Gail and I made, as did Tom and the cooks too. Lots of onion, carrots, celery, peas, and corn in gravy, served over mashed potatoes. Yum! It reminds Gail and me of Mom and home, as it was a favourite dish of ours way back then too. Tom and I finished off a bottle of wine with a generous glass each, and after a little more kitchen work, we all went upstairs to watch the first of four videos of Gail's and Tom's six week cruise. Their ship was just beautiful, much more elegant than I imagined a cruise ship to be! It was such fun watching as this was a professionally made video which they bought, and we saw them three times during the hour plus movie! </p>
<p>Gail and I had one last game of cards, off to bed she went at 10:15, and now it's my turn, an hour later. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/vacaville_an_outlet_kind_of_da.html">Vacaville, an Outlet Kind of Day!</a></h2>
								<p>Today was a "day off" for Gail and me, a day out of the house, and with no housework on the agenda. Doug and I haven't been to Vacaville for many months, and it's a fun place for Gail and Tom to browse around in when they're here. However, in the past they been here when the weather was warmer so today's chilly climes were not expected. Brrr. The first thing I bought was a warm vest, replacing one I lost a few years ago; it was just what I needed under my too-light jacket to be comfortable wandering in and out of the stores. We were surprised to find empty parking lots this close to Christmas, and learned that the only good day the stores have had recently was on "Black Friday", and not even the two days following. One of the biggest stores is closing out by Christmas, and with the dearth of customers one could see why. I didn't buy much either, although found a few fun Christmas items for the house... a wind-up Santa and tree, another set of mini-muffin pans, and sprinkles for the sugar cookies I will be making with the children.  </p>
<p>Gail and Tom treated us to lunch at "Fresh Choice" and we were ready to eat early, at 11:30, after a light breakfast at 8:30. It was delicious, as always, and my salad plate was piled high enough that I didn't even end up going up for my usual baked potato or cornmeal muffin! It was good to have another few hours to walk off the calories! </p>
<p>Gail and Tom found some of the items they were after, and a few fun gifts for the children too, which they will give them before they leave. Gail was looking for a new rain jacket, and has been for some time, so Doug suggested stopping on the way home at the North Face outlet store in Berkeley, and she found one she liked almost immediately. The colour is great and the fit perfect, so she was one happy camper! Tom was not so fortunate, and will have to keep looking for his replacement in Vancouver. We also stopped for some sourdough bread and milk at Berkeley Bowl before heading home over the Bay Bridge. It was great to see the usual Christmas lights on several buildings as we crossed the bridge, as they always remind us of beautifully wrapped gifts. </p>
<p>We arrived home about 7 P.M., tired and relaxed after all the walking and fresh air, but we had bags of things to put away, Gail heated up some leftovers for Doug and Tom. Just as they were finishing up their dinner (neither Gail nor I were hungry, so shared a big pomegranate and ate an orange each), Bryn called to ask if they would like to join him at the movies... the new James Bond film. Less than eight minutes later they were out the door! </p>
<p>Gail made a pot of tea, and we enjoyed hot cuppas along with a few games of cards, enjoying the quiet time alone. I talked to Patrizia, whose little one year has been ill since Saturday. She and her husband are understandably quite worried about him, and we talked about her options, hoping tomorrow will be a better day for him. </p>
<p>I wanted to get something done in the house, as there is so much to do before Akane, Bryn, and the children move in next week some time, so I took a big stack of my unread books off a two drawer stand in one of the spare bedrooms, giving them so flat space in the room, and emptied the drawers for them. I still have a bit more to do in that room, but it's coming along, thanks to Gai's help. Gail and I took some time to stop and read about a dozen or more very old postcards I bought at an antique shop last year in Niagara Falls, all written in the early 1900s! One day I hope to have them all in albums, in the appropriate years. </p>
<p>Bryn popped in to say hello to us, and chatted for a bit before heading home. We had one more game of cards and then went off to bed. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/christmas_lights.html">The San Francisco Christmas Season Officially Begins!</a></h2>
								<p>Gail and Tom went off sightseeing today, to Ghirardelli Square, Fisherman's Wharf, and Pier 39. They left at 11 A.M. and as soon as I waved goodbye to them, I went into high gear and started moving chickens out of the living room, and removing all but books from the bookshelves in the dining room. It was a big job but it was very satisfying to see uncluttered shelves and be able to dust so easily.</p>
<p>After lunch, Doug put up the Christmas lights in the living room. Together we moved the children's bookcase into the hallway, and I washed the floor under the windows and the windows while he was installing the lights. Those lights are just what I need to get me in the Christmas spirit and Doug had Christmas music playing too. Once that was all done, I sat down for a late lunch, and a hot cup of tea with it. I actually sat long enough that I read through a magazine, something I have not done for a while at a meal. </p>
<p>At 2:30, I left to pick up Riku at school, and gave him the option of walking right home, or coming back here for a snack. He chose a quick visit here first, and so was able to see the Christmas lights. He was very excited to spot Grandpa's jellybean jar, empty for many months now, filled with Christmas jelly bellies, in some of his favourite flavours... vanilla, coconut, cherry, apple, and candy cane. I had put up some of the decals on the windows in the kitchen and the rest of the main floor, and Riku made me promise not to do any more decorating without him. He had his snack, with a bowl of pomegranate too, which we both love so much, and managed to get most of a picture drawn as well, before it was time to leave. </p>
<p>Mirei was partway down the stairs when we arrived, and asked me so sweetly "Would you like to come and play with me?" but I had to decline, as we were going to be over just two hours later, and I wanted to continue with the work here. Time is running short, and soon they will all be living with us, with lots of playtime. </p>
<p>I managed to get a few emails written, took some of the chickens and knickknacks upstairs for temporary storage... we have a little spot under the eaves where we can stash things, and when Gail and Tom arrived home at 5:10, Gail and I sat for a fast cup of tea and game of cards. By then it was time to walk over to Hampshire Street. Akane had an art exhibit she wanted to attend, and Bryn was going to drive her there and then pick her up. However, as it turned out, he just stayed on with her instead. </p>
<p>Tom stayed home and Doug went to his T'ai Chi class. Riku and Mirei both drew pictures for Gail while Mirei finished off a bit of her dinner, Riku wanted me in his room with him alone, telling Gail "to "focus on Mirei" in the living room. He wanted me to himself, to show me his newest Lego and made that perfectly clear! He also read an entire Frog and Toad story to me, with lots of his usual expression, making it obvious to me where the exclamation points are. It's such fun to see him doing so well. Bryn told me that he had shown Riku how it was possible to read out loud a little bit faster, and even though he wasn't telling him this to get him to read faster, it was obvious to me that he was doing so. I think this will make reading more appealing to him, as once he knows he can read more quickly out loud, doing so won't seem quite such a "chore" to him. </p>
<p>Gail and Mirei, meanwhile, were having lots of fun too. They read, Mirei "fed" Gail, Gail pretended she was sleeping, and Mirei would wake her up, so Gail and I both enjoyed our quiet times with the children. We sat together at the table for dessert and they did a bit more drawing, and then it was tuck-in time for Riku. I read a story to Riku, of course, at bedtime, and then snuggled up for a cuddle while he relaxed and drifted off. Just as I moved to leave him, he rolled over, told me in a very sleepy voice that he wanted to wave goodbye to me, and drifted back to sleep when I told him I was not leaving the house, but just his room. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane were home when I emerged, and even though we had planned to play cards with them, it turned out that they don't have any! Mirei was a very sleepy girl; Akane got her ready for bed, after Mirei ran around showing us her belly for a few minutes, and so off we went, saying goodnight to our little girl. Bryn dropped us off, and then we got started at some more housework.</p>
<p>I started taking wooden animals and the knickknacks upstairs, Gail moved lots more as well,  and then we all moved the pile of books from the bedroom up to the top shelves of the bookcases. Some of the larger animals from Mexico do not interest us enough to keep them around, so we sorted through those, dusted them, and Doug ended up helping us with the tough cleaning jobs at the top of the hutch, as well as dusting the tops of the walls and ceilings. This was a chore that really needed doing and it felt so good to have some help with it all! </p>
<p>Two games of cards and a late cup of tea ended our very busy day and we all headed off to bed a little earlier than usual, although somehow it was midnight before I turned my light off! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/a_day_out_petaluma_and_santa_r.html">A Day Out... Petaluma, and Santa Rosa with Charlie Brown!</a></h2>
								<p>After sitting down last night to decide how to spend Gail and Tom's last three days with us, we realized we had time to go to the Charles Shulz museum in Santa Rosa this trip after all, as well as a side trip first to Petaluma, for stickers!</p>
<p> Gail was especially delighted, as she was ready to stock up on them, and I am always happy to stop by Mrs. Grossman'stoo. Before setting off, though, Gail and I walked over to the hospital so that I could get my free flu shot, needed before the beginning of the year, in order to continue volunteering as a doula. The bonus was that I got to show Gail the labour and delivery floor where I work, so that she can picture it easily in her mind when I write to tell her I'm off to a birth. </p>
<p>We left the house at 9:45, hoping to make it to Mrs. Grossman's in time for her 11 A.M. tour; and we did it with minutes to spare, thank goodness. We enjoyed the free tour, got some free stickers, and then spent a long time browsing through the store, picking out our favourites to bring home. I like lots of different lettering styles, but found some fun new ones as well. Gail found lots of new birthday stickers which she was after, so we both left happy. </p>
<p>We were all ready for lunch by that time, and tried a new spot Doug found on the Internet, a cafe that makes their own sourdough bread fresh each day. The sandwiches were huge, and delicious, and fueled us all for our next excursion, a trip to the Charles Schulz museum, which I had read about a few months ago and was interested in seeing. Luckily, everyone else did too, and we were very happy to spend a couple of hours reading lots of Peanuts cartoons, as well as hearing and learning lots about the wonderful man who created such a grand set of characters. We stopped in at the "Warm Puppy" cafe, just across the street from the museum, part of the indoor ice rink that Charles and his wife founded many years ago for the community in which they lived. Gail and I sat close to the fire, just a table away from Charles Schulz' favourite and reserved table... still with the reserved sign on it, and enjoyed our hot cups of tea. </p>
<p>Doug had also read about an independent cheese maker, so we wandered around for a while trying to find it. Finally we did so, wandered up a long farm drive, and were met by the unsmiling woman we expected from the site but also the generous samples that were promised as well. We bought a nice two-pound wedge and look forward to making a nice big macaroni and cheese casserole soon. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug are trying to fit as many burritos into this trip as can be managed, so Doug suggested "Lucinda's", a take-out spot Bryn found a few years ago north of Mill Bay, near Tiburon. Gail and I had decided earlier not to eat dinner, then changed our minds and decided we would share a burrito. While standing in line to order, we also thought a shared quesadilla sounded like a nice appetizer to eat in the car. Yum! </p>
<p>Once at home, we sat to eat, had a pot of tea, and of course Gail and I played our usual card game, before starting back in at work. Gail and I plan to go downtown tomorrow. Tom and Doug are off on an adventure that doesn't interest us, so we're going to wander around the city, and have lunch at my very favourite restaurant, the "Zuni Cafe".  And since Gail and Tom are treating us all to pizza tomorrow night, here at home, the dining room table had to be cleared off completely, once and for all. There may not be time for any extras at the end of a day out.  It was a big job but finally, by the end of the night, all was tidy and all went to various places... upstairs, in drawers, and out for Goodwill. </p>
<p> How wonderful to have help doing this! Gail has made it possible for me to be so much further ahead in not only Christmas preparations, but in preparing to have Bryn and his family move in with us for two plus months. I hate to think of her leaving in just three days, but I am grateful to have had her with me for two full weeks! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/a_day_at_home.html">A Day at Home</a></h2>
								<p>Gail decided late last night that, rather than go downtown today, with lunch out, we should stay home and try to finish off as much as we could in the house. We had a lazy morning, eating breakfast with Tom, and playing cards. I mixed up three pounds of butter, Gail cleaned out my fridge, and then I started scanning Riku's pictures into Doug's computer, so that Gail could take her originals home. </p>
<p>Doug came home after his T'ai Chi lesson, had a quick lunch, and then he and Tom headed out to the Nike Missile Battery, something that interested them both. From there they went on to a viewpoint at the Marin headlands (where Doug took a terrific photo of the Golden Gate Bridge), the pet cemetery in the Presidio, the "disappearing" gun and armoury at Baker Beach, and then picked up three pizzas from "Little Star" for us, courtesy of Tom and Gail, for dinner. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gail and I continued on in the house, getting so much done! I was so pleased, as there was no way I could have managed to get so much done on my own. And it is so much more fun to have company doing it all too. Gail did lots of filing for me, and I worked my way through a huge pile of paperwork that Gail had sorted first. These are the jobs I hate to get started at, so having part of it done for me made a world of difference. </p>
<p>We did stop, of course, for a small and easy lunch... hard boiled eggs, a little cheese, and tea, with two games of cards before getting back to it. </p>
<p>Riku had been to his Japanese school in the morning, followed by a birthday party for Nicolo. Mirei, her mom, and her dad were busy in the morning, and attended the party too, after which they dropped Mirei off here, at about 4 P.M. Mirei's first request of the day was to "paint", so paint she did, making some lovely spatters along the edges for the first time. Gail took a nice long shower, after which Mirei happily played with us both, offering us "tea" and goodies.  Bryn took a short nap while all of the above was going on, and then after Riku's homework and piano practice, picked Riku and Akane up to join us for dinner. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom had purchased a few pre-Christmas gifts for the children, and the two containers for Riku, filled with dragons and knights, were a huge hit. Mirei got a pink feathered boa and strutted about with it around her neck before dinner. </p>
<p>Gail and I had prepared a big salad and some extra veggies for Riku, and had the table set, so that when the pizza arrived we were ready to sit down and enjoy it all. Tom and I had wine with our dinner, as we have most nights, and we polished off a plain deep dish pizza as well as a deep dish veggie one, which Gail declared the best pizza she has ever had! And there are leftovers... best of all!</p>
<p>Tom and Doug had the best day and were super enthusiastic about so many aspects of it; we heard all about it during dinner. They spoke with men who were actually part of the Nike missile crews during the cold war, and had many chilling tales to tell about life with atomic weaponry! And they not only got to see the operation of the world's only restored "disappearing gun" (a six-inch cannon that — after firing its shell — retreats into a sunken pit behind a wall), but were actually made a part of the gun crew for one of the loading and "firing" demonstrations.</p>
<p>After dinner there was time to read a few of our Christmas books, now stacked up on the living room coffee table, ready for the season. And we are all, especially Riku I think, looking forward to getting the tree, and start the decorating in the house tomorrow. </p>
<p>Riku was tired after his busy day, as was his sister, and Bryn managed to get them out the door at 7:10 for their usual bedtime routine. Riku had time for some coconut ice cream before leaving, but Mirei took her favourite Devon custard home with her in a container, carefully carried in a bag, all by herself. </p>
<p>Gail, Tom, Doug, and I went upstairs immediately after the last of the tidying, and watched two more of their purchased videos, with some of the highlights of their trip to New Zealand, New Caledonia, Toranga, and other beautiful spots. Gail was almost asleep, so we just had a quick game of cards and a cup of tea... and no more work for tonight, before heading to bed. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/christmas_tree_time.html">Christmas Tree Time!</a></h2>
								<p>Well, this was an exciting day for me. It's never truly the holiday season for me until we have a tree up in the house.There's magic in that wonderful smell of a living tree in the house that brings back memories of Christmas past. And today was the day!</p>
<p>We four adults had a lazy quiet breakfast at home, with Gail and I enjoying our last sourdough toast, fried egg, "bacon", and hot cups of tea, polished off with a game or two of cards. Everyone was busy after that. Tom and Doug brought up the suitcases for the final packing of this almost three month trip for Gail and Tom. Gail pulled everything out and put it into piles for Doug to pack later on, sorting and purging as she went. Doug and Tom went off to a record store, then stopped for a few groceries, and landed in at home a couple of hours later with a container of Mitchell's coconut ice cream. Riku was doing his piano practice and homework, even though he called to complain to me that he really really wanted to do his homework in the afternoon. All the adults agreed that he would be very happy if it was all done and the rest of his day free, although he wasn't convinced until much later in the day that we were right. Mirei was doing what Mirei does best, keeping busy and engaging everyone at home that she could in joining her in whatever that was. I had plenty to do, a bit of this and a bit of that, happy to see things coming together. </p>
<p>After lunch we all met at the Delancey Street Christmas tree lot on Bayshore Blvd. Doug and I bought our tree there last year and were very happy with it; the folks who work there are very friendly and helpful and there is always a great variety of trees in different sizes, so the perfect tree is always available. Bryn wanted a <strong>big</strong> tree this year, their last Christmas in North America for the unforeseen future. The bigger the tree, the more I like it, so we went for it, both of us helping to pay for the most gorgeous lush eight footer! The children happily wandered up and down the rows of trees with us, and Riku made me laugh out loud, pretending to be "cool" whilst "smoking" his candy cane treat. Mirei looked on amused at the antics of her big brother. </p>
<p>Bryn and family came back to the house with us; he and Tom helped Doug get the tree off the roof of the car and into the house for the set-up. Akane and Bryn left for ice cream at a local dairy spot and Riku got busy decorating the mantle with my small collection of Santas. Most of them are ones that Beth painted years ago, but there are a few extras being added from time to time. Riku took his time, rearranging them in different spots, but did the funniest thing this year, adding puffs of cotton batting to the tops of their heads. I thought they were snow, but he assured me they were clouds! Riku is so excited about this holiday and goes around humming or singing Christmas songs... "Here Comes Santa Claus" and "It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas", as well as "Jingle Bells" with Mirei joining in. MIrei was happily tootling around the house, "helping" with the decorations too, but also keeping busy in her "kitchen". </p>
<p>Bryn called to ask if he and Akane could stay out for dinner on their own, so Mirei and Riku had mac' and cheese, and got popped into the tub for a long splashy bath here. Bryn picked them up at 6:30, all set for some playtime at home and an early to bed night, all set for school tomorrow. Riku did admit he was very happy not to be going home to the rest of his homework! </p>
<p>Doug and Tom went off to buy burritos for us from a favourite spot in the Mission District, and Gail enjoyed hers very much, as did I. It was Tom's least favourite of all the burritos he tried this trip, but he likes the rice that is usually included. He and Doug have been doing a taste test all over the Bay Area and enjoying every bite of it. </p>
<p>Gail and I played cards, relaxing for our final evening together, knowing neither of us will be playing cards together again until March, when we gather in Vermont for Kelly and Gregg's wedding. Doug and Gail then got to the packing up of the bags for the trip home tomorrow, and when that big job was done, we all went upstairs to watch the last of four video tapes of some of the places they travelled to on their cruise. Now we're waiting to see their own personal tapes so we can see more of them! One quick game of cards before bed, and since the alarm is set for 6:30 A.M. we all headed off to bed at 11:30.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/gail_and_tom_leave_for_home.html">Gail and Tom Leave for Home</a></h2>
								<p>The alarm was set for 6:30 this morning, to give us a little time together before taking Gail and Tom to the airport for their 11 A.M. flight. As is often true, I woke up fifteen minutes before the alarm sounded, a reaction I think to my strong dislike of being wakened in such a way. I showered quickly, dressed, and checked my email, before Gail came out also dressed and ready for her tea. She too had wakened around 6 o'clock, and so we had time for two games of cards and time to just chat at the table. We left the house at 8:05, and arrived at the airport before 8:30. Gail was happy to have the one big bag off her legs once we arrived; all four of the big bags wouldn't fit in the trunk of our compact car. We walked to their check in point with them, and after a photo, said our sad goodbyes. I know I won't be nearly as productive without my sister here; we have decided that each of the sisters should go once a year to each other's homes, all at the same time, and help each other sort and purge! Wouldn't that be fun! </p>
<p>I had started the laundry before leaving the house, and got that all finished up today, which included the duvet covers and bedding from the guest bedroom. I wrapped some gifts, and realized how little shopping I have done in preparation for Christmas. I know I have to get going at this, as there are cards to write, a tree to decorate, and more clearing to be done before Bryn and his family move in next week. Oy vay! </p>
<p>I called Bryant today to remind him to use his Kiva gift certificate from last Christmas, as Doug had managed to find the code numbers on his computers. Kelly had misplaced them, but I found out had just found them and so it is finally going to happen. Bryn used his in January, but the other three children were not able to lend any money, as all the would be borrowers had been funded, but there are lots of new ones ready to be helped out now. I also talked to Caillie later and Doug walked her through the site so that she could do hers as well. I look forward to hearing who everyone chooses. </p>
<p>I look forward to my walk to the school for Riku each day, as by 2:30 I am ready for some fresh air and a change of pace. I packed him up a yogurt, some grapes, an orange, and a half slice of "Grandpa's" toast, and headed up those 132 steps. It's chilly out there today. Brrrr! Even as I write this tonight, I can feel the cold in the house, although I know I am tired as well, from a too short night last night. I'm planning on heading upstairs early tonight with a warm "bed buddy" or maybe two tonight, since Gail won't be here using the other. </p>
<p>Riku came running up to me in the courtyard, with a big hug and hand holding all the way home. How I am going to miss this when they move to Japan. It's not worth thinking about right now. I love all the stories he tells, and how he is more aware of when I am telling him a little "story". When I gave him the warm toast, I told him that Grandpa had said he thought he smelled something like cinnamon and apple toast, to which I claim to have said "Oh no, not at all. I think you are smelling the Christmas tree." Riku looked up at me and said with a little smile "You didn't really say that did you Nana?" and I had to confess that the whole story was a fabrication, but at least he "gets it" that it is just to amuse him. </p>
<p>We decided I would walk him right home today, although through the hospital grounds, as it was chilly and he had to use the bathroom. So off we went, and in just minutes he was sitting at the table, playing with two or three of his creatures, while eating the snack I had prepared. Mirei had asked when I went in "Are you going to stay to play with me Nana?" and I told her I was going to take her to my house instead. She was a happy little girl going off down the street with me, and I was surprised when she stopped halfway down the block, and asked "Where is he?" I had no idea who she meant and asked her to repeat what she was saying twice, as all I could see were some bags lying on the sidewalk. Then she said "Where is the man who was sleeping here?" and I realized she meant the homeless man (or perhaps a man sleeping off a hangover?) last week. I told her that maybe he had gone home, or maybe he was visiting someone, and that seemed to satisfy her. </p>
<p>Mirei walked all the way home, chatting and taking notice of lots of things... birds on the wire "Which one is your favourite? I like the big one! Do you like the big one too?", and stopping, as her brother did, at the hospital parking signs to point out and name the letters. Mirei smiles at everyone and says hello in a big voice, with lots of smiles coming her way in return. She looks adorable in her big puffy pink print coat! </p>
<p>Mirei often knows exactly what she wants to do when she walks in the front door, and today she told me she was going to wash some dishes and some fruit too. So, she immediately pulled out those items from the little kitchen area, and then proceeded to start to drag one of the kitchen chairs to the sink. I got out her plastic apron, and then left her to her busy work, happy as a clam. She had some "custard please!", and we snuggled up and read two Christmas books.... the "Wee Christmas Mouse" and "Baby's First Christmas" which seem to be her favourites right now. </p>
<p>I took a peek at her in the living room after showing her the beautiful pink sky, and noticed that she was using the little reading lamp as a microphone, singing away into it, and holding on to it too. Of course I ran for the camera to get this on tape, but she never quite got back to the same position with it. She was singing away in Japanese and it was such fun to see. I shall put a link to the YouTube site here when I get that organized. I had her sing a little bit in English too. </p>
<p>Doug dropped Mirei off at home just as her Daddy walked around the corner and gave her a big hug when he spotted her. She had told me earlier she didn't want to go home, but I told her that her daddy would miss her so much and ask "Where is my Mirei? Where is my little girl?" which made her smile and convinced her to leave after all. I'm sure she was delighted to have him right there when she pulled into the driveway. </p>
<p>Doug went to his T'ai Chi class, not typical on a Monday night, but he knows he will be missing classes over the holidays. I took some tea and popcorn upstairs and watched two of my taped Oprah shows, both worth watching. It was a quiet night around here... no cruise videos to watch, no extra work done in the house, and no cards and tea with my sister. However, she did call to say they had just landed in at 7:30 or so, and were happy to be there after a long busy day. </p>
<p>We're off to bed at 10:30. Tomorrow I hope to get lights up on the tree; I can't wait to see that big tree aglow! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/the_lights_are_on_the_tree.html">The Lights are on the Tree!</a></h2>
								<p>Today was a busy-around-the-house day, getting the front bedroom cleaned and cleared out completely for Bryn and Akane's arrival. Doug did a great job washing the windows inside and out, not an easy task in this old and tall house! </p>
<p>Perhaps the children will end up sleeping in the twin beds, and not in the smaller, darker middle bedroom, but there are now three big empty drawers free for them. All the CM products that were under the bed and in two of the three drawers are now upstairs in a storage space under our bed. And in making space there, I cleared away lots of items for giveaway to various places. So, all in all, a very productive day! I also decorated the </p>
<p>Riku called this morning, upset, but I could hear Bryn reminding him in the background that he had a great morning, and within a couple of minutes Bryn had him giggling away. He uses me as his sounding board and always tells Grandpa in a sad voice that he wants to talk to me. I am always glad I am here, as I think he often just needs to talk it out. </p>
<p>Candy called and we had a very long natter (as Mom would have said), and later in the day Gail wrote to say she had almost unpacked and put away all the things from their four big suitcases. What a big job that was, but Gail is happy to get home and will be happy to be settled in once more. </p>
<p>I left with Riku's snack and my camera at 2:30, and met up with Riku in the hallway. We walked to the bathroom together, and I watched the door for him. He isn't very comfortable going to the bathroom without an adult at school and I have noticed he often is anxious to get home to use the one at home. I think there are some children there who push or peek under the door, or perhaps Riku has heard of such things and doesn't want any part of it. </p>
<p>We sat outside the front of the school, on a seat that goes around a tree, for his snack time. As soon as we sat down, Riku pulled out a piece of scrap paper on which he had drawn a number of Chinese characters. He told me that one of the lines said he loved me, and when Miss Chan walked by, she asked him if he had told me what he said... and read out "I love my grandmother." He tells me all the time and so I know it's true.  :) </p>
<p>Riku knows lots of the children who come out the door with a parent, and often leans over to tell me in a quiet voice "he is in grade two." or "Her name is Sarah and she's in the other grade one." Today the kindergarten teacher he had for English, Miss Chan, the same one above was moving some things into her car. She is always so very nice with Riku, often patting him on the head as she passes by, but always giving him a lovely smile and says "hello" in her very quiet voice. She is expecting a baby next spring and Riku wishes he could see that baby when it is born, but no doubt he will already by in Japan. </p>
<p>As we walked by her car, Riku whispered to me "I think she is very soft and warm. Also she is very sweet." and a few feet ahead, even though she had gone back into the school by then he said "I hope she didn't hear me." I reassured him that even if she had heard him, what he said would make her very happy. </p>
<p>Riku often skips down the hills, and fills me in on his day. He had lots to tell me today and we were home before we knew it! Mirei was there, of course, and wearing pink panties... no diapers. She is doing very well with her potty training and this is perhaps the last step before she "gets" it. Once again she asked if I would stay and play with her, and Riku asked too. So off the three of us went to their bedroom, where Riku kept busy with his Lego monsters, asking me which one was the good guy and which the bad, and Mirei buzzed around bending over backwards, and playing with her "cell" phone. I stayed perhaps a half hour and Akane and the children waved goodbye to me as usual from the front window. </p>
<p>I relaxed for a bit with an Oprah tape, a cup of tea, an orange and an apple, and then had a baked eggroll for an extra bit of dinner. Not too hungry these days, but I'm keeping busy and not thinking too much about what to eat. I had a hard boiled egg earlier so wasn't too hungry at all. </p>
<p>Doug had put the star on our tree, before going to T'ai Chi... a "new" old star from Bryn, who bought it, and some wonderful ornaments on EBay last year. When Doug returned from his class we put the lights on, using four strings of the old-fashioned kind, twice as many as on our usual sized tree. It took quite a long time, but it looks just beautiful and while Doug placed the reflectors on some of the lights, and strung the garland 'round and 'round, I added a few more Santas to the mantle, and added some other figurines to the table in the hallway from the box that Bryn brought over. I am sitting here now looking at this big gorgeous tree, beautifully lit, and the lit Santa figure from Doug's childhood, sitting on the washstand in the dining room. It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas around here! </p>
<p>Riku called again before his bedtime and then again almost an hour later; I told him we could decorate the tree tomorrow, or at least start on it, as we will want to do it all together on the weekend, finishing it up then. For now, I am very happy to have it lit and cheerful looking in the living room. How I love a real tree, and this one is our biggest one ever! </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a Canadian sitcom "Slings and Arrows" and what a treat it has been.</p>
<p>Off to bed at 11:30... I think it will be a Finn morning tomorrow! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/two_boys_today.html">Two Boys Today... and a Sick Girl</a></h2>
								<p>Wednesday and Friday mornings are my loosely scheduled day with Finn, although "life" interferes often enough that it doesn't always happen. Sometimes he hasn't slept enough and needs an early morning nap at home with his mom, or sometimes something comes up here that interferes, but I try hard to see Finn on these days if at all possible. He's changing fast, and I know how precious these early days are. </p>
<p>Susan wasn't sure today would work for us, as he was quite sick on the weekend, and had had a high fever over those two days. But they came over after all, and Finn was his usual sweet self, if a bit pale and listless. I think a change is good when little ones aren't feeling well, and it gave his mom a chance to run some errands too.</p>
<p>Finn is a Grandpa's boy when he is well, but today he lifted his arms for me to hold him, and would nestle against me for a minute before asking to get down. This happened perhaps six times over the course of the morning, and it was a treat to have this extra little snuggle with him. </p>
<p>It was too chilly to go outside, but the Christmas lights and the little "singing" Christmas villagefrom Beth, kept him occupied for quite a long time. He kept making the sign for "more", asking me to clap to turn the music on for him. It was the sweetest thing to watch, and he was delighted when he managed to clap loudly enough to have the music come on for him! </p>
<p>Much to my surprise, Finn ate a poached egg with dry toast, and drank lots of orange juice as well. He does tend to eat well here, although I wasn't expecting him today after his rough weekend. </p>
<p>He had a great time playing with the magnetic stacking truck toy; Finn loves it when the pieces all fall down, of course, and joined me in the chorus of "Oh no"s each and every time that happened. He got quite a chuckle out of it! </p>
<p>Finn loves to take apart the toy kitchen stove bits, emptying the drawers of the "silverware" and the shelves of the plastic dishware. After that has been pulled apart it's time to start in on the big basket that holds all sorts of play goodies. Today before we left the kitchen I asked him to help me pick them all up. "NO!" was his instant reply, but I gently convinced him  by singing "Clean up, clean up, everybody everywhere.... " and soon he was humming along with me <strong>AND</strong> putting things in the basket with me.</p>
<p>Akane arrived to bake a banana bread for a pot luck luncheon tomorrow at one of the mom's home from Mirei's nursery school. She had made one a couple of years ago for the first time, so got busy with that. </p>
<p>Finn loves being read to these days, and I asked if he would like to sit on the sofa with me and read. He gave a big smile and off he went, pulling himself up and plopping himself down beside me. We went through a nice stack of them, and were reading an especially favourite one of Riku's and Mirei's... a pop-up Christmas story about a little mouse, when Susan arrived. She felt he needed an early nap today, so it was wasn't long after 11:30 after nursing, that they waved goodbye.  </p>
<p>Akane left around noon hour with the banana bread baking in the oven, and smelling oh-so-good within twenty minutes. </p>
<p>I picked Riku up at 2:40. We didn't decorate the tree as we had planned to after all. Instead we watched "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" (the Burl Ives version),  as he loves the story and the songs. It was a cozy Christmasy thing to do, snacking on gingerbread cookies and fruit in the bedroom, snuggled together enjoying the movie. </p>
<p>Then we headed downstairs and drew a lovely Christmas picture. He did a little fine tuning on the mantle, something he enjoys doing very much, moving these just a little bit this way and that. </p>
<p>While I made dinner, he had his tub, we ate dinner, and before we knew it, it was tuck-in time. He was sound asleep at 7:45. That bit of time with him goes by far too quickly! </p>
<p>Bryn IMd me about 10 to say that Mirei had thrown up for the first time in her life. It went through all her bedding on her own bed, and a half hour later she threw up in their big bed. He was here before 11P.M. with all the bedding and put the first load in. I will do the rest tomorrow. Poor wee girl. Hope she feels better tomorrow! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/an_unexpected_day_with_mirei.html">An Unexpected Day with Mirei</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 7:15 today and the first words out of his mouth were that he didn't want to go to school. He almost always wakens with a smile and his arms wrapped around my warm neck, but today he wanted to complain about his lot in life. Too much homework is his biggest complaint, and for good reason. This current generation has homework in kindergarten whereas their parents and grandparents didn't get any until at least grade three, and even then it was minimal. Amelia complains about it too, and I suspect the majority of children do. Poor wee guy; I do feel for him, but I know once he's there, he's fine. </p>
<p>However, he was reluctant to get out of bed, and finally we agreed to sit in the living room with the lights turned on the tree to read about six poems from our latest Shel' Silverstein book. This made our morning a little more rushed than usual though, so Doug sat at the table with him while he ate and drew, and I got his lunch put together. He drew a fabulous fantasy bird/robot/creature; his drawings always make me happy, and he was his usual cheerful and pleasant self on the way to school. </p>
<p>Today was the day that Akane was going to a potluck luncheon with the moms at Mirei's nursery school "Little Angels", but Mirei is still not well, and so plans changed to have her visit with us here instead. Akane walked her over about 10:30, and even though it was obvious Mirei was not quite her usual self, she was smiling and happy to see me at the door. She had a busy morning too, "feeding" Grandpa lots of goodies from her kitchen, admiring the little lit village, and clapping her hands to make the singing start. Of course she loves the tree, glowing even in the daytime, and knows that she can touch the (LED) lights on the windows but not  the old-fashioned bulbs on the tree. </p>
<p>I wanted to get some food into that empty tummy, and was pleased when she ate a good portion of oatmeal with banana. That went down very well while she drew two pictures for me. She hadn't slept much last night, even though she hadn't vomited after the second time, she was obviously just not well. So, into bed we crawled with four of her favourite Caillou books, carefully chosen from the new spot in the hallway (over Christmas), and we snuggled in to read two of them. Within fifteen minutes of going into the room, I was tiptoeing out, leaving Mirei cuddling a soft dog and a soft cat, chosen from the big baskets of possibilities. </p>
<p>I scanned some photos I want to print, had my lunch, and got some more things organized in our bedroom. I will be so pleased when all the baby and children's clothes have gone to various new homes, as I have far too many for a grandmother to use up! I wish I had time to distribute them individually to my doula moms, and some of them will go to those women for sure. </p>
<p>Mirei napped for two hours, ate about three-quarters of a poached egg with a half slice of dry toast, and that was that. She had a hard time with the last couple of bites of egg, which told me how sick she was, as she can eat two in record time when she is healthy. Today she held each of those bites for the longest time in her mouth, and then quietly said "no more." </p>
<p>I needed a hair cut, so she came along with Doug and me and had a great time. As Doug parked the car, Mirei spotted a giant woman's face hanging from the second floor of a house; it was fascinating to her and she had a good look at it, before I pointed out a fake owl two doors down. Lots to see with Mirei's sharp eyes; she rarely misses a thing, much like her big brother. </p>
<p>I had to wait a half hour for my gal, so Mirei and I strolled slowly up and down a block on 24th Street, stopping to see a train going 'round and 'round the tracks in a window, into a shop filled with lots of World Trade gifts... lovely painted stones, soft felt animals, golden and brightly coloured balls, many of which Mirei could pick up and inspect, which she did. When I showed her a pink roundy rock... it was actually quite lovely, soft soapstone, she said to me "Let's take that home with us." and the clerk smiled. I asked if she would like a plain cookie when we passed the bakery and to my surprise she quietly said "No thank you." This gal knows what she wants in her tummy today, and what she doesn't want. </p>
<p>Doug came to walk her about while I had my hair cut, and they too wandered up and down the street stopping to see whatever caught their eyes. When we were walking back to the car, Mirei decided to pick up a great big dry leaf I had been kicking along. It instantly became a telephone, and she chatted away with Grandpa, and he answered back using his own pretend and invisible phone. I wish I could have taped the conversations as she talked to Riku, her dad, and to her mom too! The leaf also provided lots of entertainment in the car on the way home. But first, we stopped again to have a better look at that big face, and the fellow who lived in the house turned on the lights on his tree and windows for her too, much to her delight. All the way home, she tore off bits of one side of the leaf to "feed" to Grandpa, and occasionally would let me have a piece too. Of course she was passing out "pink!" candies or cookies in her own mind, and Grandpa was pretty full by the time we got home. </p>
<p>Akane picked Riku up from school today, and so we gave them another hour alone together and an extra hour with us for Mirei. I had washed all their soiled bedding, and three of Mirei's sleeper blankets(!) from the night before, and had just enough time to get the last of it dried, into a big bag, and read Mirei two Christmas stories before Doug left to drop her at home at 5:30. She asked if she could borrow "A Baby's First Christmas" to take with her; I like being her own personal lending library. </p>
<p>I made myself a big cup of tea, and treated myself to a solid hour of taped Oprah's; I needed something mindless and quite enjoyed Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett having fun discussing their latest movie, followed by a very entertaining Will Smith talking about his latest movie too. It was just what I needed, although I did a little sorting of children's clothes into sizes after finishing my tea. </p>
<p>Doug came home, we had a light dinner, and then went upstairs to watch two more episodes of "Slings and Arrows". I could feel myself drifting off, which annoys me, as I really don't want to miss any of it, but night time is finding me more tired than is ideal during these busy times. I got my second wind though and stayed up until past midnight working on photos and answering a couple of emails. How I wish I could stay up all night, one night, and still feel fresh as a daisy in the morning! </p>
<p>P.S. Later in the evening Bryn IMd to tell me that Mirei had thrown up at the table after eating a couple of apple slices. Poor wee boo. She's not used to being sick, but the local pharmacist told Bryn there is a bug going around that takes two days to leave the system. She has until tomorrow night to lose this one, if it's the same bad bug. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/tree_decorating_today_and_twin.html">Tree Decorating Today, and Twinnie and Winnie Moved In!</a></h2>
								<p>Today is the day Riku and I especially have been waiting for, the chance to decorate this year's tree together, with the whole family. We've had lights and the garland on up to now, looking gorgeous, but not it's time for all those old treasures to come out of the boxes. To make it even more special for me this year, Bryn has donated the wonderful old ornaments he bought on EBay last year, which I admit I coveted. </p>
<p>I came downstairs early, before 7, to find so many comments on all the old photos I posted on Facebook last night. Bryn, Myk', Kelly, Carol and others wrote to tell me which ones were their favourites, or that they hadn't seen before. So, that was very satisfying as it took a lot of time to do them last night, when I should have been wrapping gifts or writing cards! </p>
<p>Riku was disappointed when Doug ate the last piece of pumpkin pie over the Thanksgiving weekend, and I decided before drifting off to sleep last night that I would make pumpkin muffins for him this morning. I had those fresh out of the oven when Bryn came by with Riku, leaving Mirei to eat the rest of her breakfast at home with her mom. </p>
<p>Riku was willing to sit down and make a birthday card for Tomoha's sixth birthday. I was very pleased as she drew one for him too, and I know she will be thrilled to have one from Riku too. These two children are unlikely to see each other again, but her Mom and I are in touch so perhaps we can at least keep them connected in some small way as well. He did a careful job with it, choosing stickers and even drawing a butterfly on the upper part of the card. </p>
<p>And by the time he finished and we had started putting the decorations out, Bryn was back with Mirei and Akane. Riku was so anxious for everyone to be in there at once, placing ornaments, but it was a little crowded! Mirei was right there too, so wanting to hang the pieces she selected, but often having trouble placing them on the tree so they stayed. Riku was very patient with her, and would put hooks on for her, and suggest places for her to hang them. Riku was climbing up and down from two chairs to get his in different areas of the tree, and carefully put lots of the brass ornaments from his Dad's childhood on the back of the tree, so that "people outside can see pretty things too." </p>
<p>Akane made tea and she, Bryn, and Riku really liked the muffins, as did Doug. I was worried that I had made too big a batch, but I could see that wasn't going to be a problem after all! Riku and I ended up working on the tree on our own towards the end of the morning, and he was anxious that every decoration on the table not be left out. We left off at 11:15 to make lunch for the children, and I plan on doing those special decorations on my own later on. This is such a full lush tree that I think I might get them all on. Still to come... the icicles, but Riku and Mirei may want to help with those later in the week. </p>
<p>Pasta for lunch went down well, as Riku has a bad cold with infected sinuses, and Mirei is snuggling and stuffy too. Mirei's appetite is not quite back to normal for her, but she did better than Akane and I expected her too. </p>
<p>Immediately after lunch, both children played together by pulling the duvet off the bed in the little bedroom and curling up with all the children's blankets from the drawer, and playing there and in the living room. They had such fun together, and there wasn't one moment that wasn't just plain fun for both of them. They dragged out a few animals too, and at one point I saw and heard Riku talking with one of them saying he was the daddy, and Mirei piped up that she was the mommy. On and on it went... lovely to see. </p>
<p>Riku was to have gone to "Peter and the Wolf" with Berne, from Bryn's office leaving here at noon, but she hadn't bought the tickets and it turned out they were sold out when she tried to buy them today. Riku seemed a little concerned about going out with her on their own, once he heard this news, and asked me if one adult after another, or Mirei, could go with them. However, we all have plans... Doug and I were going to a movie, Bryn had to work and Mirei needed a nap at home. He was assured he would have fun and he did indeed. Riku kissed me several times, waved goodbye from the front porch about four times, and blew kisses to me as we pulled away. </p>
<p>Doug and I saw two great movies... a Czech film called "Beauty and Trouble" followed by "The Boy in Striped Pajamas", a movie about the Holocaust and difficult to end the afternoon with such a depressing story. It was so well acted, and moved along at a fast pace though, and I was glad I saw it. </p>
<p>We stopped for groceries on the way home in the pouring rain; our winter rains have arrived at last, and we're all happy to see it after two years of near-drought conditions. </p>
<p>I called Riku to see how his day had gone, and even though I didn't get all the details, I found a little fish tank on my microwave with two goldfish in it! Berne bought them for him and when they move to Japan, she will house them. Riku was thrilled to bits about it, told me I had to feed them every day, but we decided that once he moved in that it would be his job. Their names... Twinnie and Winnie.</p>
<p>Caillie had also left a sweet message on our machine, wondering how our gingerbread making had gone... it hadn't!, and to say goodnight. I am loving these calls from her, usually while she's at her Dad's, saying a short goodnight to me. She told me she would call tomorrow and I'm sure she will. </p>
<p>Light dinner at home, Doug upstairs to watch a two hour program, and I read the morning paper, tidied up, wrote a few emails and sorted through photos for my latest blogs.  Bed at 11 P.M. tonight after a 1:45 A.M. lights out last night. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/christmas_wrapping_hail_and_a.html">Christmas Wrapping, Hail, Gingerbread Smells, and an Overnight Visitor Too!</a></h2>
								<p>I spent the entire morning wrapping Christmas gifts, not finishing them up yet, and doing the laundry, so the time flew by. The weather has turned frosty, and we had hail, hard big hail for the first time here in a very long time. Brrrrr! It was right at noon hour, and I imagined the children out on their lunch hour, huddled in the cafeteria, looking out in wonder. And I imagined Akane, correctly as well, under the bus shelter waiting for the bus to go and fetch Mirei from nursery school. Neither was out in it, thank goodness, as it would have hurt for sure coming down so hard as it did. </p>
<p>I enjoyed a quiet lunch upstairs with some TV time, just to have a break from the bending all morning over the table. It was a pleasant interlude, and I enjoyed my big cup of hot tea before leaving to get Riku. It was raining hard at 2:30 and I had Doug drive me up to the school, but when the rain slowed down, decided Riku and I would walk home. I think he likes and needs that little interlude between school and home, and of course we both enjoy the walk and talk. </p>
<p>Today Riku asked me about Twinnie and Winnie, his new goldfish, and I told him they seemed fine, if a little lazy for goldfish. They are just hunkering down near the bottom of the tank and don't even swim to the surface when they are fed. </p>
<p>We talked also about choosing to do good things in life or bad things, and how some people do one thing and others go the other way. Interesting conversation with such a little boy, but later Bryn told me that he had been talking to Riku, asking if he would choose good or evil. Riku was busy building something when he was asked, but casually said "good". Then Bryn asked Mirei the same question and without blinking an eye she replied "evil". We laughed so hard; she has no idea what it means but she chose the opposite of what Riku decided on. What a girl! </p>
<p>Riku asked if I would stay at the house with him while he ate his snack and played. I didn't take one along today, knowing there would be no outdoor picnic today, but Akane made him toasted sourdough and cheese, and Mirei ate a little bit too, while they both sat and played at the table.</p>
<p>I left soon after as Bryn had called earlier asking if I could help tuck in Riku at home while he worked here, and later picked Sean up at the airport.  </p>
<p>I was so hungry, so quickly made a veggie burger for myself as soon as I walked in the door. The cold weather makes me hungrier than usual! </p>
<p>It dawned on me once at home that it made more sense for Riku to just sleep here, so he and Bryn arrived around 6, they both ate dinner... I made Riku's, and Akane sent over two dishes for Bryn.</p>
<p>This worked out so well as Riku had some free time to rearrange the mantle one more time. I had found some new Santas to add to the shelf, and they all required (as far as Riku is concerned) those little puffs of clouds on their heads, a big job to get it just right. I noticed this morning that the last time he was here, that Riku had placed one of the tiny China Santas on the roof of a tiny house, as though he were getting ready to climb down the chimney. He certainly has enjoyed the house decorating! </p>
<p>Then it was his tub time, a short one tonight (he was humming Christmas songs the entire time), a few short stories,  a few poems, and tuck in time. He was so stuffy, with infected sinuses, and had trouble falling asleep because of it. I emerged at 8:05 and he fell asleep just before 8, not too bad at all considering our late start at dinner. </p>
<p>I got busy, inspired by the cold night, and made my first batch of gingerbread dough... it's beginning to smell a lot like Christmas! I went through some photos, wrote a few emails, and puttered about in the kitchen getting December birthday cards ready to mail tomorrow.</p>
<p>Bryn left at 10:30 having completed his work, Doug went up to bed not much later, and I stayed up too darned late once again! I enjoy having this quiet time completely on my own, but it takes its toll the next day around dinner time, when I am more tired than would be ideal.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/its_too_cold_to_be_san_francis.html">It's Too Cold to be San Francisco!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke this morning with his second rant of the week, telling me as soon as he opened his eyes at 7 o'clock that he was <strong>NOT</strong> going to school today, that he didn't like his teacher (whom he likes <strong>SO</strong> much!, that he didn't like some of the children, that he didn't like having only two weekend days, and going to school on one of them, and five days at school, with homework, too much homework, etc. etc. Oh, and he was sick too, and coughed and had to blow his nose, all of which are true. </p>
<p>I just lay beside him, letting him get it all off his chest, listening to him, and murmuring "yes" quietly to him when he asked if I was even listening to him. When he stopped he went off to get a new book to read, and I got dressed and crawled in with him while he ate his morning banana and oranges listening to the poems. Then, all was well.</p>
<p>Bryn later told me he very rarely complains about anything once he has some food in his tummy. Too bad we couldn't hook him up intravenously while he is sleeping. I do think he's growing fast though, as I can see how full his face and body has been getting recently. </p>
<p>When I was a little girl, the house in the mornings was often so cold in the winter months, as the coal furnace had not warmed up our big house yet. Mom would turn on the gas stove, and while the porridge cooked on top of the stove, our clothes would be hung on the open door, warming. With ten children at one point, I'm sure there were layers of clothes all vying to get warm, but finally each of us would have at least one, if not two pieces of warm clothing to put on. I will remember all of my days how good that felt, pulling them on as fast as I could so as not to lose any of the warmth. It is so much easier for me to do this for Riku, and he loves it as much as I did. I warm it all up in just a few minutes... socks, underwear, an undershirt, his long sleeved white shirt, and his navy cotton pants. I hope this is a memory he will hold on too, as I did. </p>
<p>We had a very easy morning, as there was time for Riku to draw two pictures today... both involving weapons, fire, and enemies as well as "good guys". He likes me to sit with him and help him eat  which I am happy to do. I often did it for his dad too, when he was that age, as like Riku, Bryn was not a patient eater, and had a hard time just sitting chewing and swallowing! Eventually they do it themselves, so I am fine with doing it while I can! He ate a full bowl of porridge, toast with "bacon" and orange juice. He brushed his teeth, and got himself bundled up in his bright orange Roots sweatshirt plus his navy blue duffle coat that makes him look so British. He's not crazy about it, as I think no one else wears anything like this at school but he is so handsome in it, and I must get a photo of him wearing it. </p>
<p>Riku is such a noticer! Despite being able to see our breath in the air, Riku pointed out how beautiful the tiny yellow daisies were out front of a house on our walk, and then there was his "favourite" tree, a lovely rounded laurel bushy tree, quite small, and with shiny green leaves in two different shades. He often comments on it, and tells me something new about it that he likes. Today he pointed out the purple flowers growing against an ugly wall, so that it wasn't ugly anymore. I guess it is his artistic eye that draws him to these colours. </p>
<p>I packed up the box for Toronto today! Yahoo! I had hoped to have it out last week, but it didn't happen, and I had to snaffle one of the Christmas decoration boxes to mail it in. This took quite a while, but after Doug had lunch, we dashed out to mail it... it should be there in five to seven business days, which means it should be there before the 25th, with any luck at all. We found replacement light bulbs for our tree, and got home in time to walk up to get Riku after school. </p>
<p>I was worried about Riku's fish, and stopped in at a pet store when we were out to ask why they are both just parked on the bottom of the bowl. I was told there may be too much ammonia in their small plastic tank, due to their high output of urine!, so I told Riku about it, just to be on the safe side in case the worst happens. We talked about pets dying and the responsibility of owning pets; Riku thought if the fish did die, I should just buy a dog, because he loves dogs, and Auntie Susan would take care of it, if I wanted to go on a trip. He has answers! </p>
<p>I was to babysit for Bryn and Akane tonight, as they had plans to go out for dinner, but Akane was not feeling well when I dropped Riku off at 3, and said she would likely be staying home. Mirei was in a very feisty mood, blocking Riku from watching TV when he settled in on the sofa. She wanted to put his paper crown on from school, but didn't want him to adjust it on her head, so even though I took several photos, I only managed to get one shot of this fast moving girl today! Meanwhile, Akane and I decided it made sense for Riku to come over tonight to sleep again, leaving Bryn to go out with Sean and friends, and Akane to get to bed early. He had dinner at home and then Bryn dropped him off at 6:30, after Riku had some time with Sean. </p>
<p>I had Christmas music playing when Riku walked in ( I had been talking with Tay as well just before Riku arrived), and he was once again delighted to see the beautiful tree lit up, and to hear so many songs he has been learning. I had put more balls on earlier so it meant we could finally put on the icicles. Riku is a very patient boy, paying attention to what I told him about the need to hang just one on at a time, and to hang it so it hangs straight down. I was amazed at how seriously he took it all in. The tree is very close to being done, but needs more icicles tomorrow. </p>
<p>Caillie called at 7 P.M. here, 10 her time, to say goodnight, a lovely habit which I am enjoying so much. And Riku got to say goodnight to her too! ... especially nice for them both. </p>
<p>There was just time for Riku to do the one more drawing he had in his mind before it was tuck in time, a little later than I would have hoped. However, he was very cooperative, brushed his teeth, got his pjs on in record time, and listened to the Chipmunks song twice before heading in for the last three Shel Silverstein poems in our current book. He was sound asleep at 7:55. </p>
<p>Doug and I changed most of the water from Twinnie and Winnie's tank, refreshing it twice, hoping to bring a little life to this tank. It seemed to be working, as for the first time since they arrived we saw them swimming about. Fingers crossed as I think Riku might be very upset if they don't make it. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched "Gray's Anatomy" and thank goodness it was on tape, as I fell sound asleep about half way through it! It is bedtime for me now, to avoid falling asleep in the movie tomorrow afternoon. Doug has free tickets for it, and it's a Brad Pitt movie, so I must stay awake! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/the_demise_of_finnie_and_winni.html">The Demise of Twinnie and Winnie, and an Afternoon at the Movies!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke up at exactly 7 A.M. today, and I awoke at the same time. The house was really cold, much more so than usual, as the temps have been dropping all week. We had about a high of 11C today and a low of 4C, so we snuggled under the covers after getting a book to read and I got Riku's fruit plate ready. For the first time in ages, Riku also hid under the covers so that Grandpa could find us. I must admit, it was tempting to just stay under them! </p>
<p>However, we read our books, and Riku started thinking about what he was going to draw when he got up. That little mind never stops! He told me it was going to be a fantasy picture, and it was a colorful game of shooting and forts. </p>
<p>Before he started in on it, I warmed his clothes in the dryer (and today even warmed my own(!), and he was happy to step into his warm socks at the end. Me too! </p>
<p>I got dressed and when I came into the kitchen Doug and Riku were standing over the goldfish bowl, with one fish dead on the bottom and the other not looking too healthy at all. Within ten minutes both fish were quiet on the bottom, and Riku dealt with it all so much better than I thought he would. He told us it was no one's fault, and that he thought we should get a dog now! Right... that would make that little boy very happy I know, but it would mean I wouldn't be travelling much to see him or anyone else either. No thank you! </p>
<p>On the way to school today, Riku decided to comment on everything he could see and use references to the five senses, or any adjective that might fit the situation. So, here's a running commentary... "My eyes see the leaves trying to stay on the tree, my nose smells the air and the flowers on the wall, my feet feel the sidewalk, and the crunch when I step on a berry, the cars are resting and happy they don't have to climb the big hills yet, the ants are searching for food, the birds are singing and hanging on to the wires, the man is going to work, my hand is holding your hand and we like holding hands, etc. etc." </p>
<p>I was expecting Finn today, but his usual Thursday morning babysitting is attending the school concert tomorrow for her grandchildren, and so is having Finn today instead. I know he's going to just love seeing the tree all lit up, but it will now have to wait until next week. </p>
<p>I made great headway with the wrapping today and am close to being finished with that job. I also spent an hour putting more ornaments on this big lush tree of ours, and getting yet more icicles on it; it will hold lots more, but this was a good start. Doug packed up the packing boxes for the ornaments and got those stored downstairs, so now the dining room looks tidy for the first time since last weekend. Slowly but surely it's all coming together. </p>
<p>Doug had won free passes to an afternoon sneak preview for today, the Brad Pitt movie to be released on Christmas day. This meant no walk home with Riku today, instead picking him up in the car, and dropping him off with his mom and sister. I did sit in the back seat with him while he started eating his snack, the first of which was apple slices with cinnamon, a treat we haven't had in a while. He was carrying two pieces of art work, one yet to be finished, and gave them both to me. One, a leaf, is drawn with a special crayon, but I have forgotten what it is called. </p>
<p>Doug and I dashed to the theatre on Van Ness, as we have to line up to get decent seats, well ahead of the start time. Turns out the afternoon showings aren't as crowded, so we had an hour of sitting on the floor (me), with Doug leaning against the wall, before we were allowed into the theatre. I was cold sitting, and went off outside to buy a big hot cup of milky tea. Perfect! The movie was "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button", based on a short story be F. Scott Fitzgerald. It was two and a half hours long, but didn't feel like it at all... a quirky story very well acted, and the time passed quickly. </p>
<p>I phoned Riku to say goodnight, and he told me he had left a mean message on my answering machine, because  "I was angry that you weren't home and I wanted to talk to you." That will teach me to go out!  :) </p>
<p>We were hungry but stopped at Costco, to avoid a trip tomorrow, and arrived home too late for a regular dinner. I scrambled some eggs and "sausage" for Doug, had some cheese, with fresh pineapple and coconut ice cream for my own dinner!, and did a little emailing before heading for bed earlier than usual, at 10:30. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/sunny_day_playground_at_the_to.html">Sunny Day and "Playground at the top of the hill?"</a></h2>
								<p>Leisurely morning around here today, the first week day morning of the holidays for the children. Bryn sat at the table with Akane and the children, eating scones and drinking tea, before leaving for work earlier than usual. 'Twas lovely not to have to rush through one thing at all... lots of time for drawing (Riku) and puzzles (Mirei) during breakfast, and Akane got some unpacking and sorting done. </p>
<p>It was a sunny day, and so I told the children we should go off to the playground. "Which playground?" Mirei asked, "the playground at the top of the hill?" Yes, that was the one I meant. </p>
<p>This little girl is communicating so very well. This morning Riku called her a little girl, and in a <strong>very</strong> <strong>big</strong> <strong>voice</strong>, not befitting a little girl at all, Mirei announced to all of us that she was <strong>not</strong> a little girl and she was not a baby, but she was a <strong>big</strong> girl now, and she was <strong>three</strong>! She reminded us of this several times, I might say many many times, over the day that she was three. She holds up those three fingers, reiterates that yesterday she was two (holding up two fingers), but today she is <strong>three</strong>, just to make us understand what a big difference this is. </p>
<p>She is very aware of others ages too, holding up five fingers for Amelia, one finger for "baby Finn", and five fingers plus one for Riku. This morning she also told me that "soon I will be four, then five, and then a very big girl." This is true! </p>
<p>Mirei is full of "because" these days, repeated as soon as she tells you she is going to do something. She feels compelled to explain her reasons, perhaps more like her Nana that anyone guessed, so we hear things like "I am going to the bedroom now because I have to get a blanket for my baby. I will be right back!" </p>
<p>Mirei has an unfailing ear for language; I will say something to her, she picks up on the one word she doesn't know and promptly asks "what that word means?" I must tape some of her conversations soon, as her language skills just blows all of us away. Akane says this is true in Japanese as well, and amazes her with how much she knows, and how well she explains herself. Mirei just really pays attention to detail, and so she repeats it once out loud, and she's got it.  </p>
<p>So, off we went to the playground, and had such a good time. We were the first ones there today, so I chased Riku, his favourite thing of all, and admired Mirei climbing up the straight steps carefully to follow Riku on the above ground play equipment. They both spent quite a bit of time on the swings, and Riku hung from the monkey bar grips for the first time ever, or at least for the longest time ever. </p>
<p>Home for a snack an hour and a half later, then Riku's piano lesson at noon. His teacher told Akane she is giving him so much practice homework, and moving him along so quickly, because he is a very good student and she feels he can easily do it. How nice to hear this, as we too think he is doing so well. </p>
<p>We had lunch after that, Riku worked on his latest Lego kit building, another complicated one with 312 pieces in all!, and Mirei busied herself with her babies, the cradle, and the stroller. Being a mommy is a lot of work!  She loves to sit in the cradle too, and has made herself quite a nice little play area in my kitchen, meaning we step over lots of things on our way to the laundry room and the table! Now her "treasure trunk" from "Little Angels" has been added to her furniture. </p>
<p>Akane and Mirei left at 1:30 for the apartment, so that Akane could pack up some food items and empty the fridge. Riku had an appointment to see Dr. Solomon at 2:45, to check out his blocked sinuses (with what we thought must be an infection), and his bottom, which continues to break out, never quite healing, despite various treatments. </p>
<p>Dr. Solomon is so wonderful with Riku, speaks directly to him, and asks permission before doing anything at all. Riku is just fine with having his ears checked, takes nice deep breaths when his chest and back are being listened to, and is even comfortable about having his bottom looked at. Dr. Solomon told Riku that he thought he would make a fine doctor one day. While we were waiting to see him, we read two books, one on dinosaurs, and one on the heart, both with lots of interesting information. He remembered enough to tell his dad at dinner that there are more red cells in the body than there are stars in the Milky Way galaxy! </p>
<p>We stopped at Costco on the way home, and Riku was happy to wander around and get a few samples (as were Doug and I!) We stocked up on lots of bananas, tiny seedless oranges, and got in some nice cheeses for the Boxing Day party we have planned. Riku had spotted someone with a big box of pizza on the way in... I saw it too, and he asked if we could have pizza for dinner, just a plain one. So we looked and couldn't fine just a cheese pizza, but I did buy him a slice of plain at their counter, while Doug checked out. He said it was "just okay" when I asked how it was, but after five or six bites he had had enough. </p>
<p>We stopped at Hampshire Street to pick up Akane and Mirei, stopped at Walgreen's to drop off a prescription for cream for Riku, and then home for dinner. Both children were very tired and we decided an early tuck-in time was just what was needed. I ran the tub, and Mirei had a quick tub before dinner; she had a surprise birthday phone call from Caillie, who thought we were celebrating her family birthday tonight, but we will be doing this tomorrow instead. Caillie could not get over how well she is speaking. </p>
<p>Riku had a quick bath after dinner, just before bedtime. Dr. Solomon had suggested that I tip his head back and allow a few drops of saline solution to help clear those sinus passages. I am always so amazed at how willing Riku is to allow some of these things; he makes no fuss at all when I syringe his ears with a whole bulb of warm water, and tonight he was nonplussed at having water dropped up into his nose! What a guy! I always tell him how proud I am of him, as I know most children would just not allow it, never mind so easily agree to having it done. </p>
<p>He was too tired to read to Bryn, so instead he and I snuggled and read the book from Auntie Kelly and family, "How to Draw a Bird". He loves it, and I'm not surprised, as the artist in him surely appreciates the drawings in the book, and his active imagination enjoys the story. It took all of five minutes for Riku to drift off into sleep.I tiptoed out of his room at 7:30 and Akane left Mirei sleeping at 7:45. </p>
<p>Bryn had gone over to the apartment to pack, and Doug, Akane, and I had a quiet evening at home. I should be doing Christmas cards, but knowing they aren't going to make it before Christmas has taken the pressure off this year. I will send them off though, eventually, and soon, as I have the cards made of Riku's art, and want to share them with friends and relatives who know him and his love of drawing. </p>
<p>At the end of my evening, I had an email in from Susan, along with a "painting" Finn had done on the computer. He told his mommy it was "for Nana"; it's great, with lots of bright greens, blues and purple swirled together. Sweet! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/visit_with_santa.html">Visit with Santa</a></h2>
								<p>A little boy with very cold feet and hands crawled into bed with me this morning! Doug was still sleeping, and Riku was so very quiet, whispering to me, asking me what the plans are for today, but mostly just snuggling up and getting warm. Then we came downstairs and crawled into his bed to read, and eat the fruit bowl Bryn had made up for him. I showered while the family of four was eating breakfast, and then we waved goodbye to Bryn when he left for work. </p>
<p>I had been planning on taking Riku and Mirei to see Santa this week specifically, but somehow in my head there was no rush, as long as we did so before the weekend. I hadn't actually looked at a calendar or discussed it with anyone, but this morning, after deciding today was <strong>the</strong> day, it hit me that tomorrow is Christmas Eve! Yikes! Santa is probably on his way to the North Pole at some point tomorrow, and all those folks who were putting off seeing him, would no doubt be lined up for those photos with him today. </p>
<p>We left the house at 10:30, hoping it would be early enough that we wouldn't have too long a wait. The parking lot had lots of open spaces, much to our surprise, and we realized just how much the change in the economy has hit our city. Doug and I haven't been out shopping much at all this year, since the economy has certainly affected our budgetr, but it was shocking to see the change from last year. </p>
<p>Santa was waiting, and there were quite a few people in line with little ones, so Akane wandered off to shop on her own for a bit, and Doug took Mirei for a little walk, as she is far too restless to stand in a line for long. Riku could move around a bit, as he is careful to not get too far from me, and had lots of peeks at Santa. At one point Doug had Mirei close to Santa, but she was a bit shy when he waved to her. Not too much later she had decided she could be friendlier, and then kept trying to get his attention. </p>
<p>One 5x7 photo this year costs $16.99, and so all three of the adults took digital photos only. I feel sorry for all those people who don't have cameras and can't afford this kind of money for the photo with Santa. We did ask permission to take them and  with three of us snapping away, we had a wonderful selection to choose from! He wasn't the most talkative Santa, but he did ask the children what they wanted, and Riku told him Lego and Mirei "a princess!". </p>
<p>It was close to noon when we finished so off we went to the "Olive Garden"; Akane treated us to a delicious lunch, and the children both ate well too. We stopped at the post office to pick up a parcel for Akane from Japan, and then it was home for the afternoon and evening. Riku did two pages of homework, and his piano practice, and Mirei and I made up the dough for some sugar cookies. How this little girl loves to bake! And she loves custard too, and sat enjoying a bowl of it as a treat after I had the sugar dough in the fridge. Oh, Akane also put a new dress on her; it's just darling, and Mirei looked so sweet in it. It just suits her and she spend lots of time admiring herself in the glass door of the lower oven. </p>
<p>Akane made them a noodle dish for dinner, filled with lots of veggies, a dish they both enjoy so much. Bryn was home for dinner as usual with them, and the children told him all about Santa and what they asked for. (Riku had intended asking Santa if his — Santa's — daddy was a Santa too, but decided against it.) </p>
<p>We ended their dinner time listening to Mirei hold court, not an uncommon thing for her. Today her theme was people and their place in the world and family. It was very entertaining to listen to, as she knows of course that Grandpa and Daddy are men, but she also said today they are people. Mommy is a person and a mommy, she herself is a girl and a person, and Riku is a person and a boy. However, I am a Nana and a woman, but <strong>not</strong> a  person! No amount of arguing would persuade her otherwise. It was hilarious but this is not a girl who changes her mind easily once she has made it up! The funniest bit of all was when she was describing Akane once more; she pointed to her and in a very serious and loud voice said "That is my chi chi Mommy!"... chi chi meaning her "nursing mommy"!</p>
<p>The children were both tired, and so it was into bed early for both of them, as soon as the ice cream dessert was over. Riku read to his daddy first, and then I read a book we hadn't read in a long time... "Adele", a book Riku enjoyed just as much as he did the first time we read it.We always say "this is our favourite part of the day" as we turn out the light to snuggle, but we often say it in the mornings too! It's so nice and cozy; lucky us! Riku wraps his arm around my neck, just for a few minutes before he falls asleep, and then rolls over in an immediate deep sleep. I've always been able to go in and take photos of both him and Mirei when they are sleeping, and could occasionally with Amelia too when she was very little. </p>
<p>I tucked Riku in, Akane tucked Mirei into bed in the front room, and both children were asleep by 7:45. Lovely to have a nice long evening to ourselves, although I am feeling very organized this year, with only two more gifts left to wrap!</p>
<p> I went though some photos for blogs and to post on Facebook, and added a few more old family photos to an album on Facebook too. However, it needs some attention as I can only post sixty in an album, and I have almost twice that many. I'm getting lots of responses to them, as so many family members are enjoying them too. Bedtime too late as a result of fiddling around with them! I'll be sorry tomorrow. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/person_woman_man_boy_girl.html">Christmas Eve!</a></h2>
								<p>Well, here we are with another beautiful Christmas Eve upon us, and now almost over. The children and I had a lovely quiet morning here together, which started in the nicest way possible. Riku arrived upstairs with a peeled mandarin orange for me, which he had prepared himself. He was still in his jammies, and it was such a sweet thing for him to do. </p>
<p>Gail sent a beautiful e-card to me today and I sat with both children on my lap, so they could see it at the same time. It was lovely, in "book" form, so that I had to use the mouse to "turn" the pages. They both sat enthralled, watching and listening to me read it, page by page. A lovely moment in this special day.</p>
<p>I had a long chat this morning with Uncle Frank, while the children were busy with dolls and blankets. He was looking forward to the annual Christmas Eve dinner at Beth's tonight; she will be busy preparing a big meal for lots of folks today! Glenn and Wendy will pick up Uncle Frank this afternoon, and I believe Neal will be with them too. </p>
<p>Akane and Doug went out with lists in hand to do the grocery shopping at Rainbow Grocery for tomorrow's dinner. I happily stayed home with the children; I knew the store would be crowded, and that it would be much more fun to sit and read stories and chat with the children about tomorrow. How I love our tradition of cheese fondue for Christmas Eve dinner, as there is very little prep' work to be done for it, and it can be easily prepared in just a few minutes tomorrow. </p>
<p>During the early afternoon I even cut out the sugar cookies, but didn't get the dough made for the striped red and green cookies I thought the children would enjoy. I was sure the children would want to help me with the cookie cutting but they have made lots of gingerbread men already, and were very happy playing in Riku's room. They had pulled the comforter up to make a nice cozy spot for playing "family" ... having lots of fun. </p>
<p>At one point, Mirei came running in asking for "a piece of paper, please, and a pencil" and went running in to Riku saying "Here you go, Doctor." so I guess someone was ill! </p>
<p>They are, of course, very excited that Christmas is tomorrow. They so enjoyed seeing Santa yesterday and once in a while I could hear them talking about him, and the reindeer and how they can fly.  </p>
<p>We had a fairly early dinner, I bathed the children and got them into their PJs, and ready for our usual Christmas Eve routine of photos under the tree, getting Santa's tray ready, hanging the stockings, and then of course reading "The Night Before Christmas", the same copy that was read to Doug as a child, then to our children, and Bryn and Caillie too. We are now at the third generation for this book and this routine and I hope all of the children continue with it for many years more. Mirei was very relaxed and sleepy, more than ready for bed, and kept lolling over on Doug's shoulder during the reading. </p>
<p>Interestingly, Riku asked if both Daddy and Grandpa could read it to them, and so they read every other page. Traditions are alive and well at our home!</p>
<p>Despite not getting all our cards written this year, I am feeling very organized. While Doug and Bryn spread the presents out under the tree, I had a cup of hot chocolate, read the paper, and enjoyed watching the stack of gifts growing under the beautiful big tree. </p>
<p>I'm happy to be here with Riku and Mirei, as they have too have grown to love every aspect of the Christmas they are now accustomed to.It may well be their last one, although I like to think that one or two years while the children are young, they could perhaps spend Christmas here again. This date in Japan will be very different, with perhaps no gingerbread cookies, but I do hope they will have a tree, with lights, icicles, and all the decorations they remember and enjoy hanging. It will be a new and different Christmas for them, and I hope they remember the best parts of each. </p>
<p>Each moment this season is bittersweet, as we are into so many "last times", and it will continue this way until they leave in March. </p>
<p>Bed at midnight... </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/cold_stone_creamery_gingerbrea.html"> No "Nutcracker", House Guests, and a Busy Day</a></h2>
								<p>This was an exciting day for the children especially, as Ayako and Masu, Akane's sister and brother-in-law arrived here at 11 A.M. from Japan this morning. Riku went with his parents to pick them up, leaving a crying Mirei behind them.</p>
<p>However, they came bearing gifts and after all of that excitement  she was off to Chinatown with them and her parents for noodles and some fresh air walking around. It was a gorgeous sunny day here, much milder than it has been for a few days, so a nice way for them to start off their visit here. </p>
<p>My geraniums and daisies continue to bloom on the front steps. It is really lovely and mild today!</p>
<p>Riku and I thought we were going to see "The Nutcracker Suite" this afternoon. Riku was not all that excited about it, much to my disappointment, but of course he really wanted to be with his aunt and uncle. </p>
<p>Doug dropped us off and Riku was delighted with the fake "snow" they had falling outside the opera house. However, after all of this, it turned out that our tickets were for tomorrow! Riku could have joined them for lunch after all, although I guess there wouldn't have been room for them all in the car. </p>
<p>Riku and I decided we would take the bus to Ghiardelli Square; it is beautifully decorated and we just wandered about a bit, deciding to have a hot fudge sundae for a special treat at "Cold Stone Creamery". The idea was very appealing to Riku, and so I let him eat his full, which didn't take long at all. He just does not have a sweet tooth, and I was awfully glad we bought a small size as I got to eat most of it. Riku enjoyed those first few bites though! </p>
<p>We caught the bus home too, and both watched with interest a very interesting group of people on the bus with us. Riku had lots of questions about what was going on with them. The conversations were interesting, but everyone was very nice and behaving well, but since one was a very obvious man, dressed like a woman, Riku was especially intrigued. </p>
<p>We had some quiet time at home before the evening plans got underway so I asked Riku if he would like to make some gingerbread cookies. The dough was all ready. Mirei had helped make some up the other day, and so a happy boy helped me roll out the dough but loved being able to do all the decorating on his own, making eyes, mouths, and buttons as well as cutting the marks for the hands, feet, and belt line. I think it made up for not being with Ayako and Masu. </p>
<p>We all met up for dinner at "Little Star" pizzeria at 5:30, expecting that it would be busy. It was so crowded even at that early hour and we had to wait a while for the pizza; I would have preferred to eat at home, but once we were served, it felt very festive and we all enjoyed it very much. </p>
<p>The children were ready for bed by the time we got home, as were Ayako and Masu. Doug and Bryn went off to see a Clint Eastwood movie. Akane didn't appear for the rest of the night, so she obviously fell asleep with Mirei. </p>
<p>It was certainly a very long busy day for our houseguests, as they stepped off the plane at 11 a.m., after an eleven hour flight, and with a seventeen hour time difference.</p>
<p>It is tempting to go to bed myself although it's early for me, and I have emails to write, and photos to annotate, and things to do around here before turning in... and I do have the house to myself which is rare these days. Now there are ten of us in the house, so the next while will be very busy indeed. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/dont_stop_the_fun.html">Don't Stop the Fun!</a></h2>
								<p>This has been the busiest day!  Akane's sister and brother-in-law, Masu, were planning to spend the next two nights in a hotel downtown, and Riku was mighty upset when he learned about this. He was so disappointed and wanted to know, from me, why they couldn't just stay here, so he could see them and play with them. Of course I explained that they probably just wanted some privacy and some time downtown without taking buses every day, but it's all beyond his understanding.</p>
<p> I told Akane how upset he was, and she suggested they spend some time with the children this morning before leaving. They did this, but was my house bedlam! Riku was hot and sweating with the exertion of chasing Aya-chan around and around the house, and with Mirei right in there trying to get involved too, and the squeals from all three of them!... man, oh man! </p>
<p>They did have a little quiet time at the table, as both Ayako and Masu have little hand held gadgets one can play games on, and lots of other stuff too. There is even a little special "pen" to use with them, and that held their attention until the chasing started. Masu kept sneaking away into the bedroom to sleep some more, but that didn't last long! No doubt that is part of the reason they are heading downtown for two days. These two are not used to having their sleep broken so early or so often. </p>
<p>Riku had his piano lesson today at noon, so that meant they had to slow down a bit. All that energy could have lit up the town for a day! Akake made a big lunch for them of steamed broccoli, rice, and egg, and after they left for downtown. Not much later Akane left to join them, and I took the children off to a playground almost two hours. I so much more enjoy seeing all that steam let off outside! </p>
<p>I got to talk to a lovely grandmother from Brooklyn, who was at the playground with her grown daughter and son, and a five and three quarters year old grandson, happily playing with the visiting uncle. Riku got to join in their ball throwing fun, and after some chatting, we found out that both our grandchildren attend the Mandarin Chinese Immersion program at Starr King School... her little guy, Cosmo, is in the kindergarten class. They played so well together, tossing a ball back and forth to each other from various high points on the slides and the play structure. </p>
<p>Mirei and Riku had some time together too though; they sat in the sand and dug, and Riku pushed Mirei on the swing, something they both enjoyed so much. It's obvious that Riku likes being a big brother and it's very sweet to see. Mirei would tell him when to push her higher and when to slow down and he listened to her. </p>
<p>Mirei watched in admiration as Riku drew his name in Chinese on the sidewalk with chalk. I'm sure she will be trying to print her name very soon too!</p>
<p>It was a gorgeous day and the children shed their jackets. Nice to be wearing just shirts in the sunshine at the end of the year, and getting outside was so good for all of us. It's what we all needed after such a busy time lately.</p>
<p>I popped both children in the tub when we got home, made a big pot of pasta for dinner, and they were both sound asleep at 7:15 tonight. They so needed an early night, as while we have company they are all sleeping in one room .. in twin beds pushed together. The minute Mirei or Riku stirs in the morning, sometimes at 5:30(!) that is it for both of them. </p>
<p>Riku will have two good nights sleep in his regular small dark room, before his aunt and uncle are back. The children are so enjoying having company in the house and just don't want the fun to stop! </p>
<p>I did connect with a fellow doula today about a pregnant mom due soon, wanting to have a doula with her for her birth. I hope it's in the cards for me to be available for her, but we shall see. </p>
<p>Bed earlier than usual tonight, just in case the children do wake up early again. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/tale_of_despereaux_playground.html">"Tale of Despereaux", Playground and Trail Time, Tub and Noodles!</a></h2>
								<p>I had told Riku last night that he could come upstairs quietly when he woke, and waken me, as we haven't had morning time together for a few days... or at least not snuggle time. I had just opened my eyes at 7:15 and in he walked, all smiles and ready to get in and put his cold feet on my warm legs! After they were warmed up, I came downstairs to get a fruit bowl ready for him and showered after putting Caillou on the TV. When I came out Mirei was sitting there with him too, still in her pink sleepers, with pink cheeks and a happy smile. Lucky me! </p>
<p>It had just finished... "just at the right time!" said Riku, and down we all came for breakfast. Akane and I sat with them while they ate, and of course there was drawing time for Riku, and Play-Doh time for Mirei too. We were going off to the movies at 11 A.M. so Riku got his piano lesson over with first, which works much better for him than at the end of a busy day. He wasn't happy today about getting at it, but Akane says he does so well and always ends up enjoying it. </p>
<p>I packed up snacks for the movie and at 11:15, Doug, Riku, Mirei and I were sitting in the theatre in Daly City, nibbling on popcorn (not Riku who ate grapes and gingerbread instead),  We all thoroughly enjoyed the movie, with lots of laughs from Riku, and Mirei whispering quietly when she had a question. This was her first movie experience and she was just great; I think about 15% of the time she was very interested in looking at the people beside and behind us, and staring around the theatre, especially at the projector room. Mirei ate one kernel of popcorn at a time, every so daintily, and then had gingerbread cookies for "dessert". They were both given free t-shirts with a picture of the darling big eared mouse on the front too; I think they will fit when they are in their teens! </p>
<p>I thought some running around time after all that sitting was a good idea, and so I had Doug drop us off at a local Potrero Hill playground. He ran an errand and joined us perhaps an hour later, leaving us lots of time for tag (whenever I was close to catching Riku, he found a spot quickly and claimed it as "base!"). All three of us were running, taking turns being it, and having lots of fun. Riku pushed Mirei on the swing, he played on a hopscotch, and we stopped for a picnic snack in a sunny spot for oranges, grapes, and some water. When Doug joined us, we went for a little walk along a dirt trail, and how I loved seeing those two little ones holding hands as they walked along, or following along behind Grandpa carrying their sticks. </p>
<p>Surprisingly to me, once back home, instead of instantly wanting to have hot chocolate... it was cool today!, both children headed to the back yard. Mirei came in asking for the "poppers" that bang, and that kept them busy for a bit, distracting Riku from sweeping the yard, which needed the attention! </p>
<p>A half hour later they came in for hot chocolate with special vanilla marshmallows, and gingerbread cookies, followed by a tub coloured pink today, with lots of play-acting going on between these two. For the entire time, Mirei was the "mommy" and Riku the "baby", and he went along with it all. I could hear him "crying" and her consoling him, and when I walked in I found Mirei with a face cloth on his head and washing his face with another! It was hilarious to listen to, and to photograph! They had such fun. One of the things I think is funny and endearing is that whenever one of them gets water in their eyes, they ask for a "safe cloth". Riku apparently misheard "facecloth" many years ago, and Mirei has picked up on it too. I have told them both it is called a facecloth, but I must say for their use and "safecloth" is more apt a description! Following that, Riku happily sat and did two and a half pages of homework, which he whizzed through while Mirei sat beside him drawing. She is now making easily recognizable As, Ms, and Ns, and proudly announces that she has done her homework.</p>
<p>Bryn heard her saying she was doing a project two days ago, except she was saying "projec'", so he carefully repeated the word to her adding a very distinct "t" sound to the end of it. So for the moment "project" has become "projec...T"! It's pretty cute to hear this coming out of this just turned three year old! </p>
<p>Another recent addition to Mirei's vocabulary comes from the Dyment side of the family for sure... "actually". It turns out some of us say it a lot, and Mirei is now using it frequently. I will ask her if she would like juice or milk, she tells me her choice, and then instantly says "Actually, I will have... instead." I remember so well the first time I heard Caillie say this word and can repeat it to this day. She was caught by a five or six year old putting pink icing on her hands, and was told it was for the cookies. Caillie, at about three and five months said "Actually Emma, this is nail polish." and I just laughed so hard and will never forget it. I even have photos of the event. So, it's such fun to have Mirei saying this word so early too. </p>
<p>Akane came home from the apartment and made big bowls of udon noodles with veggies for their dinner, and they both ate it all, much to my surprise! It always looks like such a big portion for these children, but they love it. However, Mirei tonight decided she didn't like cabbage after all, but had no problem at all with the big mushrooms in her bowl. </p>
<p>Tuck in time was early again tonight, with both children asleep by 7:45. I worked on the Christmas Day album and can't wait to get caught up with the other two on the agenda! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/12/badm_ocean_beach_and_new_years_1.html">BADM, Ocean Beach, and New Year's Resolutions!</a></h2>
								<p>I've been pondering over New Year's resolutions throughout the day, and there is already quite a list of them. I spoke with Uncle Frank tonight, just past midnight, and he said he hoped he was right at the top of the list and at the bottom too! Of course he is in there for sure; I will drop him at least a line or two every day, as I know how much it means to him... and to me too as he knows he is on my mind.</p>
<p>Another resolution is to keep my blogs much shorter and more succinct; I will try to have a favourite line, or story, or perhaps a memory in each one, as well as the gist of the day's happenings, so here goes for today, just as a trial shot, to see if I can do it. </p>
<p>Bay Area Discovery Museum from 11:30-2 P.M., closing time today. On the way there, Riku came up with a new game after we had played "I Spy" for a while. He had a whole list of questions that all of us got to answer, including Mirei... "what is your favourite colour?", followed bye food, dessert, animal, bird, places to visit, and when he asked us who his favourite person was, he wanted to answer first and touched my heart when he said "Nana". Doug made him laugh when he said he had stolen <strong>his</strong> favourite person! This passed the time so quickly on the drive over the Golden Gate, and it was sweet to listen to Mirei's careful answers too. </p>
<p>Doug and I had such fun with the children at the museum. Doug took Riku off on his own while Mirei and I went into the toddler room; Riku outgrew it a few months ago (he's too tall now), so instead he spent a long time in the indoor fishing boat which he loves. We joined up in time for our outdoor picnic; it was cool sitting in the shade, but much warmer after running around! I sipped a big cup of tea today while Doug did the chasing in and out of the vine maze. Fun for all! </p>
<p>Since it was early, we stopped in at Ocean Beach for an hour. It was a little foggy, but perfect for walking and running, which we did today. These two children love the beach as much as I do, and I am going to see they get as many days there as we can fit into the next two months. </p>
<p>We stopped at Rainbow Groceries for eggs, and the children and I sat in the car while Doug went into the very busy store. I took a fun video of Riku entertaining Mirei.. hilarious! </p>
<p>Home for hot chocolate, with those delicious marshmallows again, some cinnamon toast and pears, and of course the tub, coloured blue today, and with lots of laughs and pretending going on again tonight. </p>
<p>Akane had been to the apartment for most of the afternoon, and we sat down together and fed them dinner... pasta and lots of veggies. They were almost finished when Ayako and Masu walked in, and after finishing up their meals, they were off to play and have fun with them. Riku and Ayako played a board game, with Mirei joining in, and doing very well at finding the right clues! </p>
<p>Riku wanted Ayako to floss his teeth tonight (usually I do it, and so gave her a one tooth demonstration!) and then he sat on his bed with his aunt and uncle and read two stories, with the door shut for complete privacy. He will miss them when they go, as will Mirei. </p>
<p>Riku had a little trouble falling into a deep sleep tonight, and just when I thought he had, he rolled over, whispered "Nana?", and when I answered asked me "Is the brain a muscle?" One wonders what else these little ones think about! </p>
<p>Bryn, Akane, Ayako, and Masu left about 8:30 for dinner out followed by some evening New Year's celebrations in the city, with Mari as well. I was still in with Riku when they left, but was out his door soon after. </p>
<p>Mirei woke up at 10, calling and crying for her mom, and it took me about ten minutes of more to settle her down. </p>
<p>Kelly called, I called Bryn and Caillie at their Dad's, and then called Uncle Frank to wish him a Happy New Year's too! </p>
