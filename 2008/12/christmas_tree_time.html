								<h2>Christmas Tree Time!</h2>
								<p>Well, this was an exciting day for me. It's never truly the holiday season for me until we have a tree up in the house.There's magic in that wonderful smell of a living tree in the house that brings back memories of Christmas past. And today was the day!</p>
<p>We four adults had a lazy quiet breakfast at home, with Gail and I enjoying our last sourdough toast, fried egg, "bacon", and hot cups of tea, polished off with a game or two of cards. Everyone was busy after that. Tom and Doug brought up the suitcases for the final packing of this almost three month trip for Gail and Tom. Gail pulled everything out and put it into piles for Doug to pack later on, sorting and purging as she went. Doug and Tom went off to a record store, then stopped for a few groceries, and landed in at home a couple of hours later with a container of Mitchell's coconut ice cream. Riku was doing his piano practice and homework, even though he called to complain to me that he really really wanted to do his homework in the afternoon. All the adults agreed that he would be very happy if it was all done and the rest of his day free, although he wasn't convinced until much later in the day that we were right. Mirei was doing what Mirei does best, keeping busy and engaging everyone at home that she could in joining her in whatever that was. I had plenty to do, a bit of this and a bit of that, happy to see things coming together. </p>
<p>After lunch we all met at the Delancey Street Christmas tree lot on Bayshore Blvd. Doug and I bought our tree there last year and were very happy with it; the folks who work there are very friendly and helpful and there is always a great variety of trees in different sizes, so the perfect tree is always available. Bryn wanted a <strong>big</strong> tree this year, their last Christmas in North America for the unforeseen future. The bigger the tree, the more I like it, so we went for it, both of us helping to pay for the most gorgeous lush eight footer! The children happily wandered up and down the rows of trees with us, and Riku made me laugh out loud, pretending to be "cool" whilst "smoking" his candy cane treat. Mirei looked on amused at the antics of her big brother. </p>
<p>Bryn and family came back to the house with us; he and Tom helped Doug get the tree off the roof of the car and into the house for the set-up. Akane and Bryn left for ice cream at a local dairy spot and Riku got busy decorating the mantle with my small collection of Santas. Most of them are ones that Beth painted years ago, but there are a few extras being added from time to time. Riku took his time, rearranging them in different spots, but did the funniest thing this year, adding puffs of cotton batting to the tops of their heads. I thought they were snow, but he assured me they were clouds! Riku is so excited about this holiday and goes around humming or singing Christmas songs... "Here Comes Santa Claus" and "It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas", as well as "Jingle Bells" with Mirei joining in. MIrei was happily tootling around the house, "helping" with the decorations too, but also keeping busy in her "kitchen". </p>
<p>Bryn called to ask if he and Akane could stay out for dinner on their own, so Mirei and Riku had mac' and cheese, and got popped into the tub for a long splashy bath here. Bryn picked them up at 6:30, all set for some playtime at home and an early to bed night, all set for school tomorrow. Riku did admit he was very happy not to be going home to the rest of his homework! </p>
<p>Doug and Tom went off to buy burritos for us from a favourite spot in the Mission District, and Gail enjoyed hers very much, as did I. It was Tom's least favourite of all the burritos he tried this trip, but he likes the rice that is usually included. He and Doug have been doing a taste test all over the Bay Area and enjoying every bite of it. </p>
<p>Gail and I played cards, relaxing for our final evening together, knowing neither of us will be playing cards together again until March, when we gather in Vermont for Kelly and Gregg's wedding. Doug and Gail then got to the packing up of the bags for the trip home tomorrow, and when that big job was done, we all went upstairs to watch the last of four video tapes of some of the places they travelled to on their cruise. Now we're waiting to see their own personal tapes so we can see more of them! One quick game of cards before bed, and since the alarm is set for 6:30 A.M. we all headed off to bed at 11:30.</p>
