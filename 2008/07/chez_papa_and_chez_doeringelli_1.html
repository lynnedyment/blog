								<h2>Chez Papa and Chez Doering/Ellis</h2>
								<p>A few weeks back Don emailed, asking if he could pass on our phone number to a local San Francisco gal, a woman he knows through an online music group. They have "known" each other for many years. Naturally, always being happy to meet someone knew, I said "Of course." We met today at "Chez Papa", a restaurant in the newly opened Mint Plaza in downtown San Francisco. Lee brought along a friend who works in the publishing field with her. I assumed there would be lots of music talk, but instead the conversation was varied, as travel, England in general, and Liverpool in particular were also discussed. Lunch was simple and delicious; Roger and I had cream of broccoli soup along with the tasty, crusty dinner rolls, and Doug and Lee both ordered a grilled asparagus salad. Each twosome also shared a cone of pommes frites, and I finished off the meal with tea. </p>
<p>Back home for a couple of hours, which worked out well for both emailing and Doug booking my flight east in the fall. I will be flying into and out of Toronto for the first time in years, so that works well for starting off my visit with Caillie's 11th birthday and ending it after Kelly's. </p>
<p>I also had a phone call from a little girl today. Mirei was on her way home from her nursery school program, and her daddy was trying to keep her awake. I think it worked, as she chatted away with enthusiasm, telling me she had gone to school, that Daddy was taking her home now, that they were passing a pink house, that she played, and goodbye because they were there now! </p>
<p>I missed seeing Amelia and Finn on Saturday; they had gone off to the beach with Susan, Kevin, and Bryn & family, before Amelia's swimming lesson. Today worked out well for a visit to Waller Street. Amelia wanted to bath immediately today, so she could apply a "tattoo", and Finn joined her in the tub for only the second time. He was much more co-operative about sitting down this time, playing with the various toys and trying desperately to do every single thing Amelia did. She was "washing" the walls with the bubbles at first and he just watched and then immediately tried to as well. He's just not tall enough, though, and had to be coaxed into sitting. I heard him laugh out loud for the first time, as Amelia made funny noises with a bubble blower. It really tickled his fancy and it was adorable to hear. </p>
<p>Now there's a boy who is going to be very happy when he can do exactly what he wants. He's really astounding, as today he insisted on walking up the stairs, holding on to the banister! Even though he needs spotting, it's amazing how well he managed! He <strong>is</strong> only 18 months old! If Amelia can do it, then he does his best to do it too. You can see the frustration in his face when it doesn't work out. I'm impressed with his determination! </p>
<p>He was obviously a tired fellow and Susan tried twice to put him down for a nap, so Amelia and I went ahead with our "tea". We had cookies and some chocolate candies too, and of course our milky tea. I love it that Amelia no longer puts sugar in hers, but likes it just like mine. Finn joined us with his mom, determined not to sleep if his mom didn't hold him, and no doubt not wanting to miss out on a thing either. </p>
<p>Amelia's favourite activity with me when I am at her house is to pull out the animals and have them "talk" to each other. I know that drives some adults wild, boring them to tears, but I am just fine with it. Today Amelia wanted to play with her vast collection of bunnies, and I thought to talk about Peter Rabbit, and his "siblings",  Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail. We pretended that Peter went into Mr. McGregor's garden... Amelia handled this part of it, pretending that the big basket where they are stored was the vegetable patch, while I worked with the other more obedient bunnies. I pulled down her set of Beatrix Potter books, which she hadn't read, and we read the very first one. She thoroughly enjoyed it, looking at each beautiful illustration and really paying attention. That gave us enough inspiration for a second round with the animals, as Peter didn't feel well after overindulging and the younger siblings took turns asking how he was. </p>
<p>Finn had refused to nap a second time at this point, so he joined us in the bedroom. He just rolled around in the bunnies, stepping over and around them, and when Amelia asked me to cover her with them, he too joined in and piled them up on her. It was lots of fun and I was sorry I didn't have my own camera with me. I took a few photos with Susan's, but am not very familiar with it. </p>
<p>I was back home at 6 P.M. and Doug told me he had two visitors here while I was gone. Riku had called... (how handy it is that he knows our number now(!) ), and asked if he and Jackie, the male Chinese student who is taking over from Maggie, could come for a visit. Doug is not sure, but they may have been on the bus when he called, but eventually the door bell rang and they played with Skippy in the bedroom and must have kept busy with some other activities too, as Doug just continued working on his computer. Akane called to say they had to get home, and Riku apparently remembered he hadn't had a snack!, something he usually has on the way home from school when we pick him up. Doug put out some fresh pineapple and a juice box, and after sitting in the garden at the new table for that, off they went. I'm sorry I missed them. Doug said there was a discussion about whether or not Skippy should stay here or go home with Riku, but Doug managed to convince him that he would miss all his friends if he left. </p>
<p>Kelly had time for some IM-ing with both Doug and me tonight; we shared some Canadian news stories, and I told her I was booked for my annual fall trip too. And this morning, just as I was dashing to eat a little breakfast Myk' IM-ed to let me know she had been hired to work at the ice cream shop in Mindemoya for the six weeks she is visiting with her grandparents, and Don called to tell me not to share any secrets about him at lunch.  :) </p>
<p>We had a very light dinner with a fruit and veggie plate, and watched a new British sitcom which wasn't much to our taste...  not that we have any shortage of movies/shows to watch! </p>
