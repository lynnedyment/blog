								<h2>A Boy, Bubbles, More Bugs, and a Builder!</h2>
								<p>Thursday was a quiet day around here, with lots of time for a leisurely breakfast which I really love. I guess it is my favourite meal of the day, as by the time I am ready to eat, I know exactly what I want! Doug eats much earlier, and so our first two meals of the day are eaten solo. There are days I thoroughly enjoy a perfectly cooked fried egg, with two freshly cut slices of Acme's crusty "pain au levain" sourdough, toasted, and two slices of "bacon". Other days I have half a banana and surround it with a variety of nuts... raw cashews, Brazil nuts, almonds, and walnuts, just a few of each. Other days I might have "bacon" on the sourdough, or peanut butter on one slice of whole wheat pre-sliced bread, and thin slices of old Canadian cheddar on the other. Oatmeal is another choice, although that tends to be a winter breakfast. Almost always I have a big cup of hot chocolate made with vanilla soy milk, and a really good quality chocolate, currently little chocolate bits that take some serious stirring to dissolve properly. If I don't do it well enough I get to eat the warm chocolate left at the bottom of the cup with a spoon. Mirei likes to do this too! </p>
<p>The day slid by, as they always do, but I had time for a long chat with Uncle Frank, talked about the last few photos to go into his Navy album, called a doula mom for a long visit over the phone with her too, and even got an invitation to visit them when they move next year... to either Italy or Mexico, as yet undecided! The day still went too fast to get everything done I hoped to do, but I did take time for tea and a magazine in mid-afternoon, along with a mid-day snack, and a bit of chocolate.</p>
<p>Doug and I had some errands to run today so dashed off at 2:20 to the post office and the bank. There was a huge long line at the PO but we were at Riku's school in plenty of time. I went inside again today, and smiled when I saw him walking along, hand in hand, chatting up a storm with another boy. He always comes running when he spots me, says goodbye in Chinese to his very friendly female teacher, and starts telling me about his day. He only takes a break after getting him buckled into his car seat, to ask for his snack. Happily settled in, eating cubes of cheese, a small container of fruit ( today he had his freshly picked blackberries in with the strawberries and grapes), and if he's really hungry, a few cookies or a small bit of chocolate. Kung fu seems to be the talk of the week, although he did say his male teacher does not always do real kung fu, but pretend kung fu. </p>
<p>Once home with us, Riku goes into action. Skippy usually gets some attention first, but today there were other things to do outside. He watered some plants for me using the hose, tried to talk me into shooting each other with the water guns, but it was cool by this time, and I would so much rather do this on a hot day on the beach with more space to run from him! That was fine, as the hose occupied him, and then it was in for more food... half a banana and a drink, and then into the tub. Somehow he managed to step into a nest of ants, perhaps, as he had several of them climbing on his legs and in his shoes, and knowing how much he loves to bathe, I decided that would be a good time for it. Well, it was great. There were lots of bubbles, Gumbi, and a dozen ladybugs this afternoon lost amongst the bubbles, so that kept him busy for quite a while. </p>
<p>Then it was upstairs to watch one short episode of "Little Bear", the sweet British animated story of animal friends. I just wish I could manage to get a photo of the look on Riku's face as he watches them interact, but I know a camera would intrude. He just smiles away and really enjoys it so much. Downstairs in fifteen minutes to dig out the blocks and build away in the living room, with Skippy there to watch over it all. We were busy at it when Bryn walked in for him, and was an instant hero having found one particular piece Riku and I had been searching for. </p>
<p>Doug went off to his T'ai Chi class, while I settled in at the computer for some photo sorting and choosing pics for blogs. After dinner, Doug did his magic with those, so I could keep up to date with what I have ready to post. We watched part two of a Canadian TV series, "Swords and Daggers" now available to us on rental DVDs, enjoyed it as much as the first, and came down for that last-minute email check before bedtime. The evenings fly by as fast as the days! </p>
