								<h2>Happy Birthday Doug!</h2>
								<p>Today Doug turned 64, and we started the celebration with lunch out, just the two of us. This is a rare event these days, and it was lovely. Doug had given me a gift certificate last year for "Roy's", which sounds like a burger shack to us, but in actual fact is quite a nice high-end Hawaiian-Japanese fusion spot downtown. Doug had been just once before and liked it enough that he wanted me to go too, so this was a gift for both of us. I started off with their delicious miso broth with lots of exotic mushrooms, delicate and perfectly done.  My main dish was a  firm white fish called ono; Doug had mahi-mahi. We had different "sides" and exchanged them, giving Doug my fried bananas and I ate his potato wedges. It was all yummy. </p>
<p>Not too filling though, which was a good thing, but it called out for just a little bit of something extra. Ice cream sounded appealing, and so off we went to "Bi-Rite Creamery" to start off using another gift certificate, this time a gift from Akane and Bryn for Doug last year. Perfect choice, and now that Doug knows where this spot is, I'm sure he will go through the rest of the card in no time. I was very happy with my scoop and a half of toasted coconut ice cream, as was Doug with his salted caramel... sounds strange but is strangely delicious(!), and another of almond cherry. </p>
<p>I was fairly well organized, considering a morning change of plans for this birthday. We had originally decided on a Sunday morning beach picnic celebration, but for various reasons decided to have dinner here tonight instead. The cheesecake went into the oven early, and I had everything prepped by early afternoon for a simple meal of baked pasta dish, green salad, and garlic bread. The afternoon was easy and relaxed. </p>
<p>At 3 P.M. we were there to pick up Riku from summer camp. He came out beaming as usual, carrying a red, white, and blue star mobile made in honour of the 4th of July tomorrow, and a lovely picture he made "just for you, Nana!" I am one lucky woman as later on he also made me another hand-coloured book mark too. He had some quiet time with Skippy, liked the basket with a handle that I had found for Skippy's new bed, and made a beautiful card for his Grandpa too. </p>
<p>Susan had taken the children to the Marin County fair this morning (Kevin had left early for Alaska to celebrate his mom's birthday with her), and they showed up at 4:15 or so, dusty, thirsty, and sweaty from a fun, busy day in the heat. Riku was just delighted to have Amelia here to play with him. They went running into the bedroom and played with Skippy, Kitty-cat, and all the other animal friends. </p>
<p>Finn was equally delighted to see Doug. He hasn't been here the last couple of times that Finn has been over, and Finn always looks at Doug's computer chair with a frown, wondering where in the world he could be. He immediately crawled up onto Doug's lap and was prepared to stick with him as long as he could. He's a guy's guy, that Finn, but Mommy's boy too when he's tired. </p>
<p>Akane, Bryn, and Mirei arrived at 5:15 and the next two hours went by in a blur for me. Dinner, horns blowing, trains going 'round and 'round, four children in the tub!, some quiet drawing time at different times for all four children, with Finn looking mighty pleased with himself sitting at the big kids' table. We ended the evening with cake, candles, and tea. The children packed a lot into those three plus hours, and they were all heading out the door at 7:30, tired, with Amelia in Riku's short striped "Where the Wild Things Are" PJs and Riku in his long striped dino PJs, which are both "house" PJs. Amelia gets a big kick out of wearing Riku's PJs, and really liked his Spiderman set last winter. </p>
<p>Various people had done some tidying up of the dishes and clearing the table too, but it still seemed to take a long time to get it all finished up and put away. It was really just a half hour though, but I was more than ready for some sitting down time, so took a hot cup of tea up to the bedroom, pulled out my book, and promptly fell asleep for one solid hour! The tea was stone cold, it went down the drain, and I headed up for an early night at 10:15. </p>
<p>It was a happy birth day celebration for Doug, with singing birthday wishes via phone from Amelia, Kelly & Gregg, and Bryn & Caillie from Oma's & Opa's house, plus lots of E-cards from family and friends too, as well as the snail mail cards on the mantle. </p>
