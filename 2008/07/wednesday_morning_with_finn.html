								<h2>Wednesday Morning with Finn</h2>
								<p>It doesn't always work out for both Susan and me, but I try to keep Wednesday morning open for a few hours with Finn here at our place. He gets to explore all the toys here, new drawers and cupboards, and a garden as well. This last was the highlight today; it was a beautiful day, not too windy, cold, or hot... just right! So the door was open, and Finn took advantage of the freedom that gave him. </p>
<p>He arrived at 9:20, not too sure he wanted to let go of his mom, but those stairs up are just too much to resist. Once he reached the top, he turned to wave goodbye, and headed into the main part of the house. Of course, he immediately spotted Doug sitting in his computer chair, so that left me free to tidy up after my breakfast, and even send off a short email. He would much rather be entertained by Doug than by me. Doug carries him around and points out lots of new and interesting things to him.  </p>
<p>Doug went off to shower, so Finn started his explorations in and about the kitchen and garden, once he spotted that open door! I put his sunhat on, although he was in and out so much, that soon I gave up taking it off and putting it back on each time. It was pretty cute to see him playing with the dishes and drawing at the desk fully decked out for the sun! </p>
<p>I had some flowers to plant, and Finn wanted to help by moving the dirt from one place to another. He was soon set with a small pail of loose dry dirt and my spade, which he reluctantly shared with me when I needed it. But he soon learned he would get it right back and we worked together very nicely. We were out there for an hour and a half (on and off) of the three hours he was here, perhaps more. There was lots to discover: toys strewn about, leaves, small stones, and big ones in the garden that he would lug over to me like a cat with a mouse, looking ever so proud of himself! He's just a sweet boy, with a sweet smile, that he can use to advantage. </p>
<p>When we were back in the kitchen he would open one particular cupboard that he sort of knows I don't let him play in. Out would come that little smile, with the eyebrows crooked up as though he had no idea if this were okay or not. Adorable! He responds very well to a gentle "No Finn, shut the door please." which he almost always does. His favourite drawer contains elastics and twist ties and he knows that is just fine. Today he strung lots over his wrists. </p>
<p>At 11 o'clock he was buckled into the little seat for his regular second breakfast here... a bowl of plain oatmeal with mashed blueberries in it. He likes it so much he leans forward for the next bite, each and every time, although he pulls quite the face if he feels a long piece of skin in his mouth. It comes out very quickly(!) but doesn't turn him off the next bite. Since he had still been leaning forward for the last bite, I made him a piece of raisin toast, and to my surprise he ate the entire slice, cut into little cubes, and given to him just two at a time. Any more than that, and they either all went into his mouth or onto the floor. He quite enjoys drinking from a real glass, and it's both small and heavy enough that it doesn't break when it accidentally gets knocked over. "Oh oh!" is what he says and he laughs when I repeat it back to him too. </p>
<p>Today we played "Do you like my hat?", a favourite game with all the little ones in my life. Today we started off with a green plastic top to a container he had used for beads, little animals, etc. and it was perfect, as it was quite stable and he was more than willing to have me put it on his head several times, and smiled when I put it on mine. </p>
<p>Finn likes Mirei's talking doll from Auntie Gail and Uncle Tom. It says "Mama", cries, giggles, and makes the oddest burping noise in the known universe. It also plays a lullaby when you place a tiny teddy against her heart, and Finn signed "more" over and over to hear this. </p>
<p>So, our three hours flew by! There wasn't an unhappy peep out of him the entire time he was here. He was just busy and active, wandering into the living room to look at the little photo album Kelly made for me for Mother's Day last year, delighted when he spotted Uncle Bryn on the first flip through it(!), and had a little extra time with Grandpa too. About five minutes before Susan picked him up, he finally just put his head down on the computer chair, a very obvious clue that he was ready for his nap. Not surprising either, since Susan said when she brought him in, that he would have been asleep in just five more minutes in the car. I like to think he was sound asleep by the time they turned the corner, on their way to pick up Amelia. </p>
<p>I had some IM time with Caillie today, which is such a pleasure. She and Bryn will be here in just one week! How that time has flown by; it used to seem so far away! </p>
<p>Mirei called to chat tonight; she has been staying up later at night since she began power napping in the afternoons... three hours at a time! </p>
