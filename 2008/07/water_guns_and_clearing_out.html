								<h2>Water Guns, and Clearing Out!</h2>
								<p>Riku woke at exactly 6:45 this morning, eleven hours after he fell asleep. He stretched and turned to me with a smile when he saw I too was awake. I read a couple of stories to him, and got up to make his fruit bowl. When I went back in, there he was, sitting in bed, reading one of Mirei's sound books to Skippy. Sweet sight.  I then snuggled back in to look over the first chapter in a book about family rituals. Kelly had given it to me for my 47th birthday and it's lovely. Riku had lots of questions about dipping babies into water at baptisms, circumcision ("<strong>that</strong> is not very nice!"), raising babies to the sky, another form of "baptism" among a Native Indian group, water poured over babies foreheads, and another where a man jumps over a platform where several newborns lie. The next chapter is about rituals with slightly older children, more Riku's age, so that will be very interesting. Nice to learn so early that the world is filled with varied and different traditions. </p>
<p>We only had fifty minutes until Bryn would be picking him up, but the morning went very smoothly; he had eaten, dressed, washed, had his teeth and hair brushed, and even sun-blocked, by 8 A.M., leaving him twenty minutes of fun time. He discovered the four water guns we bought as house presents on Sunday, knowing his cousins would love to take part in that activity. It was pretty cute to see Riku with all four stuffed into his pockets, and a couple of them leaking water too. He tidied the little desk, checked out his latest drawing, and told Skippy he was very proud of him for sleeping all night on his own. A happy boy left for school at 8:20. </p>
<p>Bryn and Caillie arrive in just one week(!), and there is much to do before that day comes. I got busy and had a very successful day, planting new flowers at the front entrance, washing down the steps after a thorough brushing, washing the windows on the front door, and vacuuming up the stairs. I put up an old printer on FreeCycle and it's gone! Doug helped by photographing an old table to list, and sell, we hope, on Craigslist. We don't use it, it's big and clumsy, and I won't want to move it when we leave here, and it's time we just dealt with it.</p>
<p>I had a delicious lunch, made by Soo for me, and delivered by Bryn this morning. I feel truly spoiled by this kind woman who cooks for me! I had phoned last week to tell her how much I had enjoyed a particular dish, especially on two very hot days, and she prepared it again for me. It is chock full of nutritious healthy foods... slivered braised tofu, sprouts, celery, red and yellow peppers, cellophane noodles, all tossed together in a very tasty seasoned marinade. She had suggested I add a little vinegar to it, and it just hit the spot, after all the hot work I did this morning. Lucky me! </p>
<p>And so the day went, with lots of little jobs getting taken care of, as well as plenty of IM-ing with Caillie, on and off throughout the day. Kelly is at school until 1 o'clock each day, the children are at Hans', and so there is time for checking in with each other. </p>
<p>I did take some time to sit with my tea and read my book, something I really must do more often. I have so many magazines to go through that reading them feels like a chore. Reading my book is pure pleasure! I'm enjoying the story, fiction, about a young woman traveling with her husband in the 1800s via wagon train to set up a household in a very deserted Colorado, far from home and family. It is written as though it's a journal and is entertaining, informative, and a good fast read to boot. </p>
<p>Mirei called at 9:30 tonight, sounding full of energy and excitement. She talks so fast on the phone, and so loudly, that it is often hard to understand her! I have no trouble knowing what she is saying in person, but both Bryn and I agree that we often wonder if she is speaking a language we know when she's on the phone. Soo was there, and Mirei did tell me that, and that she was not going to bed yet, in her <strong>big</strong> bed, and that she wasn't in her pajamas "not yet". She held the phone up to Bryn's ear, told him it was me, and then I heard him tell her to say "goodnight", which she did with great fervor. Funny little girl, is our Mirei! </p>
