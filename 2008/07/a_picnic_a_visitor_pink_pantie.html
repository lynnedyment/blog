								<h2>A Picnic, A Visitor, and Grapes for Grandpa</h2>
								<p>This was one busy child-filled day, from morning 'til Riku's tuck-in. Riku awoke earlier than usual this morning, at 6, telling me that he had a bad dream. I fell back asleep almost immediately but was vaguely aware of him playing with his animals next to me. At one point he leaned over and asked softly "Are you dreaming, Nana?". I told him I thought I was, but sat up right after that to learn that it was almost 7 o'clock. Riku did lie down beside me between 6 and 7, and I thought he might have slept, but am not sure. We both got up almost immediately after he ate his fruit bowl, and about fifteen minutes later, Riku realized we hadn't read any stories! "Shall we go back to bed and read?" he asked, and I agreed that we should. </p>
<p>We had chosen those books last night and so read "Where the River Begins", a story of two brothers who take a walking trip and camp with their grandfather to find the source of the river that leads to the sea by their home. Riku always enjoys it, and this is another book with wonderful illustrations. Next was "Seven Silly Eaters", an old favourite, followed by "Because a Little Bug Went Ca-Choo!", a book that Riku follows carefully as we read it, and laughs every time at the end of it. We hadn't read "How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight" in ages, and it was fun to read it in the morning for the first time. I went up to shower and came down to find him sitting on the sofa on his own, slowly turning the pages of the "Circle of Life" coffee table book we started the other night. He insisted we look at it while he ate his toast at the table, and we had quite an intense discussion about the seemingly cruel/bizarre/strange customs that many countries have, including our own, with circumcision high on the list (and on Riku's mind), along with goat's blood and feathers and painted blue faces in others! </p>
<p>Bryn and Mirei arrived about 10:15, while I was getting a second batch of mini brownies going, a treat for the picnic.I got such a big long hug from Mirei and she instantly was ready to head out to the garden with Riku. Sean arrived a few minutes later, listened and watched as Riku sang and wrote in Chinese, and interacted with Mirei who thinks Sean is there for her entertainment only. </p>
<p>They were to have taken a lunch along as well to the picnic, but instead I made them a big second breakfast, so that I didn't need to think of something to pack up. They both ate well, and off they went just past 11:30, with Mirei back here for her nap not much more than an hour later. Sean, Bryn, and Riku went to Brent's for a visit, saw the baby, and Brent's parents, and then hiked up the small hill we can see from our living room. Riku enjoys this so much, and I was happy to hear that they had some time there. </p>
<p>I tucked Mirei into bed, and within ten minutes she was sound asleep, as she remained for three hours! I had lots of time to walk over to the hospital, drop off the brownies at the staff room, and say hello to all those familiar faces. I haven't been to a birth since the end of May; I miss it, and the camaraderie of the nurses too.</p>
<p>I had a long chat with Kelly, and drank my tea, as I listened while she read me three or four children's books she bought at a publishers last week, along with some others, part of her summer school course. They were wonderful, and Kelly read one particular one with a great accent! </p>
<p>Mirei awoke at the two hour point, Doug went into her and was told "go away Grandpa!", much to his surprise and mine too. I went in just then to see her roll over and go back to sleep! </p>
<p>When Mirei woke I put her very first pair of underwear on her, <strong>pink</strong>, of course, and she got to choose her favourite of the three pairs. How proud she was, first checking herself out in the mirror, then insisting on showing Grandpa, and didn't want any slacks on until "I show Daddy!" She was at the top of the stairs, twisting herself around as best she could so Bryn could see her the second she walked in the door! It was adorable of course and soon she was out in the garden, wearing only the underwear and shoes. </p>
<p>Caillie asked me to call her at her Dad's, Russell called as Bryn and Sean arrived back with Riku, and the house was as busy as could be! Riku came in bearing two new pictures for me, these with flags, as Bryn told me that was his main theme today.He told me this morning that he had left "a beautiful drawing I did for you at school, at my house, but I will get it for you, or maybe you will have to share it!" I end up getting all the artwork anyway, so I'm sure I will see it soon enough. </p>
<p>Soon after that, Bryn and Sean left to pick up Akane to go for dinner; I had volunteered to keep both children here until Riku's bedtime. Bryn had planned to take her, but from the minute she woke up, Mirei said "I want to stay at Nana's house!" and that seemed fair as she has had very little time here over the past week. </p>
<p>She and Riku had a long bath together, Mirei insisting on seeing herself wrapped in the big new <strong>pink</strong> towel we bought for her last Sunday, and then were ready for a big dinner... mushroom risotto, lots of broccoli, cooked carrots for Riku, and much to my surprise about half a big raw carrot! Pink strawberry ice cream for Mirei for dessert, pineapple coconut for Riku (Doug picked up a new supply for him this morning), and then they had some time to play in the living room before Bryn and Sean were back at 7:10 to pick up Mirei. </p>
<p>I got Riku ready for bed immediately, as tomorrow is another busy day for him... reading program with Bryn from 9â€“11, and then here for two hours over lunch, before he leaves with the Smith family to go to a space centre and movie in Oakland. We read two stories from the book I won in grade one, which we don't read very often. One of the pages had been ripped and then redone with tissue like paper to protect it, and Riku wanted to know how that happened ... one of my younger siblings tore it ... and whether or not I was angry or sad. Sad was the answer. </p>
<p>He was sound asleep at 8 P.M., and Doug and I shared a noodle dish, which I had asked Bryn to bring home from the restaurant for us. It saved me from having to think about what to have for dinner after this busy day. I took mine upstairs to eat while reading my book and finally finishing my first cup of tea of the day, reheated many time!</p>
