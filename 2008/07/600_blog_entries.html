								<h2>600 Blog Entries!!!</h2>
								<p>... but perhaps they are not all completely finished, so don't go checking for them yet! I am working on them though, one at a time, and now that I know how to upload the photos (once Doug has done whatever he does to them first.. downsizing? and sending them to me via email), it means that Bryn is not involved in this process either. He used to upload my photos for me; I am very technically challenged! </p>
<p>Sean Cody, Bryn's friend, is in town tonight from San Diego, so the plan is for Riku to spend tonight and tomorrow night with us, while they party. Bryn brought him over about 6:15, after dinner at home, and then stayed on for a half hour or so. Riku had been promised dessert here, and there was just enough pineapple-coconut HÃ¤agen-Dazs for him to polish off right out of the container, the first time he has ever done this at my house. Of course Bryn does this all the time, and luckily enough there was just enough cinnamon caramel for him to to do the same. It was pretty cute to watch the two of them sitting on the floor, digging in. Doug was less than impressed with the vanishing ice cream! </p>
<p>Bryn did a little building with him before leaving, and once he did, Riku set up a little "tent" for his animals at the foot of the bed, using all the small cloth blankets in his room, and the little chair from the desk. He got in a few more minutes of block building with Doug too, and then I got him ready for bed soon after that. He's a tired boy come Friday and tomorrow is going to be another busy day for him, as there is a Starr King class picnic at a playground, planned for the kindergarten class tomorrow at 11 A.M. </p>
<p>While I got his water, and my clock, etc. set up for the night, Riku sat in bed reading over a new-to-him-book, but actually one of his dad's childhood books "The Magician Who Lost His Magic". He likes to see his dad's name inside the front cover and to hear that when his dad was a little boy, just his age, I sat in bed with him and read him the very same book. </p>
<p>The illustrations are just great, some coloured and very detailed and other pages quite simple with black pen drawings, so those, along with the very interesting story, were a hit. We just read one story together, "Christopher and Grandma on Safari", another book that has been in the house for a long time. It had the lyrics to a traditional Maasai "goodbye song" and Riku quite liked the words, repeating them to himself as he settled in for the night.</p>
