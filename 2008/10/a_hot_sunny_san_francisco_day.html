								<h2>A Hot Sunny San Francisco Day</h2>
								<p>The rain will be coming sometime soon, but the past week it has been above average hot with sunny clear blue skies. Our house stays nice and cool, a relief after being outside walking in the afternoon. </p>
<p>However, the mornings are perfect, even outside, and especially in our little garden, which is where Finn spent half of his time with us this morning. I opened the door to hear him saying "Nana. Nana" as Susan dropped him off here (she had dropped  Amelia at school first). Kevin is home resting, glad to be out of the hospital, so Finn and I had our somewhat regular Friday morning together. He's always a happy easy little boy, keeping himself very busy with all his favourite things in the kitchen, the laundry room, where all the trucks are, and the living room with the chickens. He also likes to hand things to Doug as he sits at the computer, and touch whatever he can get away with, mostly just Doug's water bottle, which he takes down carefully and hands to Doug, just as Amelia at the same age and on. </p>
<p>When he was here on Wednesday, I gave him a half slice of "Grandpa's toast", a cinnamon and apple bread. He liked it very much and when he saw Doug eating some this morning, signed that he wanted "more". He handed me a little red cup that I used for it the last time, and happily handed it to me each time he finished off the three or four little squares I gave him. Later he ate some oatmeal with strawberries and bananas, drawing at the table while I fed him. </p>
<p>He collected the drum and the drumstick from the laundry room today, and sat down on the floor to play it. I got out the camera, which he has decided over the last week he doesn't like, and frowned with a big "NO!" when I pointed it at him. Interesting. I did manage to sneak in a few in the garden though. </p>
<p>Susan found us in the garden sweeping when she came to pick him up. We had been outside for an hour, with Finn trotting after me, sweeping into the piles of needles that fall from the too-huge-for-out-little-garden tree. He found some blue chalk and wrote on whatever he could find... the table, the benches, and the brick, smiling happily as he did so. </p>
<p>I walked up to the school for Riku at 1:30, and this time we decided to sit in the garden area of the hospital. There weren't any interesting people to talk to, but it was still cool in the shade, and we had a big lawn, a view of the city, and some ants to keep us occupied today. Today Riku had a tiny chocolate brownie cupcake as his treat, after his usual fruit and cheese, and after spotting some ants crawling beside him, decided to treat one of them to a crumb. It was a very tiny crumb, and a much tinier ant, but he was delighted to see it moving the crumb! Down he went on his hands and knees to get a close up view of it all. There was a big long inspection going on there for the longest time! Then he wanted to see if the little family of ants that had gathered would drink some of his juice, so he took a mouthful, leaned down close to the ground and let it slide out. Then it was time to sit back and watching them come and go from that sweet sticky puddle. That was our adventure for today. </p>
<p>I had intended to take Mirei out to the playground for an hour or so, while Riku did his piano practice and homework, but he convinced me that he wanted her to stay home and play with him. He even told me she focuses on something else while he plays and does his homework, but he liked to see her face! Hmm, I wondered later if he didn't like the idea of her going off with me, even though I hadn't mentioned the playground. Maybe there was a little of both thoughts going on. </p>
<p>Doug and I went off to Costco for Akane and then on to Rainbow for fresh produce and stocking up, using a once every month coupon that gives us 20% off. Nice savings when money is tight here. Then it was home for a light dinner, and upstairs to iron while watching some taped shows. Uncle Frank called at that time, so I turned off the iron, and put my feet up for an hour chat with him. He's rethinking about a move into a retirement home so there was lots to discuss. I will be there in just eight days with him! </p>
<p>Doug and I finished off the evening with a rented movie, which we enjoyed very much. </p>
