								<h2><a href="/2008/10/riku_with_mirei.html">Riku with Mirei (Looking Back)</a></h2>
								<p>January 5th, 2006 â€” I was in Toronto; Akane, Bryn, Riku, and Mirei were in Japan, and I was so touched by this photo that Bryn sent on to me there. I remember thinking that Riku was going to be such a wonderful big brother to this little girl, and now it is two years and nine months later, and still so true. </p>
<p>Riku is a most amazing little boy. He is very tender, very gentle, and very caring with his sister. He holds her hand, watches out for her, and is the first to point out how cute she is when he sees a photo of her. Of course there are the times when she gets into his belongings, or breaks something, or teases him, and he gets frustrated with her, but by far his relationship with her is one of being her very proud big brother.</p>
<p>He was at Disneyland with his Dad last week; Doug, Mirei, and I went to the airport to pick them up after their five day trip, and as I was sitting between them on the way home, Riku kept looking over and smiling at her, telling me how cute she was, and how he had forgotten how cute she was! Cute seems to be the operative word for him, although he knows from his dad and will tell you very seriously that "cute" is not as important as nice. But still... there's his sister and cute she is! </p>
<p>It touches me so deeply to see this little boy be so careful and thoughtful with her. He gave her a panda bear on the way home from the airport, presenting her with it in the car, and then chatted with her about how soft it was, asked if she liked it, and wondered what she would name it. I look forward to seeing this special relationship grow and blossom over the years. I think they are going to be such good friends for many years to come.</p>

<p>In this photo, Riku had just turned three, and Mirei just two weeks.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/10/wednesday_with_two_boys.html">Wednesday with Two Boys.. and an Unexpected Sleepover</a></h2>
								<p>Riku and I are becoming power sleepers! Riku woke just a minute before me, giving me a little nudge, and I was shocked to learn that it was 8:45! This meant fifteen minutes less time to get ready for school than we usually have, and that is what works best for me. However, we did it last week too, with just an extra five minutes, so off we went! Thank goodness I did some prep' work again last night, having his oatmeal ready to pop in the microwave, the grapes washed for his lunch, and the lunch containers lined up on the counter, ready to fill. Whew! </p>
<p>In record time Riku dressed and up to the table, he ate his fruit plate while drawing and I got his lunch packed; I then had time to sit at the table with him while he ate his cereal and he finished off his drawing. At 8:20 he was washing his face, brushing his teeth and hair, and ten minutes later we walked out the door at our usual time with no rushing at all. I was so pleased as I know that Riku didn't feel rushed at all, although we did forget to take along the Hallowe'en sticker gift he had made for his teacher last night. </p>
<p>However, we had time to admire the ghostly creature hanging outside a window on the street with the 132 steps. We had seen it yesterday afternoon, being blown about in the wind, and so today we crept past it very very carefully, hoping it wouldn't turn and see us. We were successful! Whew! And Riku looks forward to the skull mask hanging on a door up the hill, touching it three times to hear the messages... "Hey! What are you doing?", and "I  see you!" and I have forgotten the last one. </p>
<p>Kevin was at the house with Finn about ten minutes after I walked in the door. He was such a good little guy, keeping himself busy with the toy kitchen and his favourite push-along bee, so that I got to eat my breakfast and read the paper, chatting with him as he walked back and forth past me. I opened the doors on this beautiful day so that Finn could go outside, and a big bee flew in. This had Finn both fascinated and worried, as it made quite a lot of noise up in the top part of the glass ceiling. Doug was about to try to coax it out with paper and a glass, but it had flown out by the time he got over with them. For the rest of the time though Finn kept checking out for it, as he hadn't seen it disappear. </p>
<p>So, we swept, and he played with water outside, and he ate a big bowl of oatmeal with strawberries, drank lots of water, and carried things inside and out, including the chickens from the living room! They looked pretty good standing out there amongst the leaves and debris! </p>
<p>I picked Riku up at 1:30 and enjoyed our slow walk home, hand in hand, while Riku talked about Hallowe'en and things that scare me, and things that scare him. Even though he doesn't "believe" in ghosts, he does worry about them if he is in a dark room by himself, or even upstairs on his own sometimes. We stopped as usual for Riku to have his snack in the shade at the hospital, before walking home. </p>
<p>Doug and I had decided to try out a fish and chip spot that Bryn had told us about; I usually only eat this dish in Niagara Falls, as there are two spots I particularly like, as I can count on the fish being fresh, tasty, and well cooked. We both liked this casual little spot; the fish is flown in fresh from Ireland every day, but the fish portion was very small, as were the chips, and I thought it expensive for what we got. It was inexpensive for San Francisco though, and I might have been happier if it had been haddock, rather than cod. However, it was a nice change for us, and I'm always happy not to have to cook.</p>
<p>On the way home Susan called from her cell phone. Bryn, at Susan's request, had taken Kevin to the hospital with severe pains in his stomach; he was being monitored and tested to see what the problem was. It sounds scary, as there are several things that could be going on there, one of them being leukemia, as his blood cell count is very low. I headed over asap with a small packed bag for the night, helped Susan get the children ready for bed and tucked in, and at 8:30 she relieved Bryn at the hospital. I fully expected to get wakened by either Finn, who is still not sleeping well at all, or Amelia, who often wakens once or twice as well. I had just gone to bed and was lying there, when I heard Susan come in at  11:30. She went right in with Finn, and I didn't hear either child during the night. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/10/big_blessings_and_small_ones_t.html">Big Blessings and Small Ones Too!</a></h2>
								<p>Despite expecting to have a broken sleep, anticipating Amelia waking, and possibly Finn too, I ended up with a solid eight hours under my belt. I woke at 7:15, just five minutes before hearing Finn calling "Nana. Nana.", and not long after that saw Susan and Finn waking Amelia up for school! I wish Susan had managed eight hours sleep.</p>
<p>Even though I had my camera with me, it was a typically busy-getting-a-little-one off to school hour and two out the door, with breakfast, chatting, and all the rest of prep' time... so alas, no photos this morning. Amelia and I had been talking about stomach sounds at the table, and so before leaving I lay down on the floor so she could put her ear to my belly. Rumbling water was what was reported. </p>
<p>Finn was his usual busy self, not eating much, but following everyone around, drawing on the chalk board, and putting in his time until he too had to get dressed to get out the door at 8:15. We did it, and dropped Amelia off at 8:30. </p>
<p>She looks adorable in her navy blue "middie" and white blouse, with her little "whale spout" enclosed by a white ribbon. Finn thoroughly enjoyed watching the children at play from his window view, while Susan walked Amelia into the courtyard. </p>
<p>Susan dropped me off at home before 9 A.M., and then was going off to the hospital to check on Kevin... long story short... he has an ulcer. While that is by no means good news, I was so relieved when I received the email from Susan telling me this. There were much worse things that low red blood cells could have meant, and I too was worried about them. Whew! He went home this afternoon, but needs to rest and take it easy for a while. A happy ending to a worrisome 24 hours. A big blessing indeed!</p>
<p>I spent far too long on the family tree today, as I had some very interesting emails in from two sides of Doug's family... the Dyments and the Brewers. It was wonderful to fill in so many blanks, and as a result of hearing from Myrna Dyment, I am well on my way to learning far more about the Connell's side of the family, the maternal link on the paternal side to Doug's story.</p>
<p>How I love working on this project, although always in the back of my mind... well, almost always, there is the thought that I really should be doing something else... ironing, clearing off the counter, sorting and purging things from this house, and this particular time, preparing for a trip to Ontario in just nine days. It's coming up fast. </p>
<p>However, today there was an interesting story about one of the Connell's going off to Oregon with his family, back in the 1800s. They landed there after taking a ship to <strong>Nicaragua</strong> first! What an adventurous family! After twelve years in the Columbia River area known as The Dalles, they returned to Ontario either by train... one story that is part of the family lore, or by travelling with three stage coaches. It will be interesting to see if we can verify one or the other of these stories. </p>
<p>At 1:30 I was on my way up the hill to Starr King, to meet Riku. I was there in time to see him walking through the courtyard hand in hand with his teacher, a woman he likes so much. I was able to get my camera out just as she spotted me and turned him around. </p>
<p>I had prepared his snack so we could once more have a wee picnic on the way home. It has been hot all week, and we were ready for shade again today and decided on a new seat, just outside the doors of SFGH  to continue our conversation while eating. Riku had a choice of cheddar cheese cubes or almonds for his protein, and chose the cheese. It was interesting to hear him say he wasn't very fond of this particular cheese; neither am I. It's an eighteen month cheddar, made in Oregon, but Riku has been spoiled by three and four year old Canadian cheddar, and not coloured orange either. Such a Canadian boy! He ate all his grapes (his favourite fruit right now), and a half slice of "Grandpa's toast" too. </p>
<p>How I love this new routine of ours. Akane picks up Mirei, and they have that time together, and I have an hour with Riku. I haven't had much time with him lately, and not often on his own at that, so I am enjoying every moment of it. We talk about things that happen at school... a girl is being mean to him right now, teasing, and it's good to talk it out and figure out how to deal with it. And we talk about contrails, and interesting people that walk by, and often discover treasures too. And we get to hold hands, walk very slowly, and just enjoy the time between school and homework and piano practice. </p>
<p>Riku always stops to wave goodbye from one of the upstairs windows of his house. Today he stopped in the hallway window outside their apartment, and Mirei joined him in waving. I miss that little girl when I don't see her! I saw her every day for the past two weeks or more, I think, and that smile of hers that lights up the room also lights up my heart. </p>
<p>Doug and I went off to a single malt Scotch tasting event tonight for MacAllan, a "premier whisky". I am not a fan of hard liquor, but it meant a night out, some tasty nibbles, and a nice change from being at home all evening. The nibblies... good cheese, crackers and bread, dried and fresh fruit, and olives were tasty, and we sat with three friendly young whisky afficiandos, so it was a very pleasant evening. We saw some gorgeous photos of Scotland, sipped six different whiskies, and unlike everyone else at the table, I did not prefer the 18 year old Scotch. I did enjoy the squares of Godiva dark chocolate at the end of the evening though. And now it's bedtime, after a very full fun relaxing day.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/10/a_hot_sunny_san_francisco_day.html">A Hot Sunny San Francisco Day</a></h2>
								<p>The rain will be coming sometime soon, but the past week it has been above average hot with sunny clear blue skies. Our house stays nice and cool, a relief after being outside walking in the afternoon. </p>
<p>However, the mornings are perfect, even outside, and especially in our little garden, which is where Finn spent half of his time with us this morning. I opened the door to hear him saying "Nana. Nana" as Susan dropped him off here (she had dropped  Amelia at school first). Kevin is home resting, glad to be out of the hospital, so Finn and I had our somewhat regular Friday morning together. He's always a happy easy little boy, keeping himself very busy with all his favourite things in the kitchen, the laundry room, where all the trucks are, and the living room with the chickens. He also likes to hand things to Doug as he sits at the computer, and touch whatever he can get away with, mostly just Doug's water bottle, which he takes down carefully and hands to Doug, just as Amelia at the same age and on. </p>
<p>When he was here on Wednesday, I gave him a half slice of "Grandpa's toast", a cinnamon and apple bread. He liked it very much and when he saw Doug eating some this morning, signed that he wanted "more". He handed me a little red cup that I used for it the last time, and happily handed it to me each time he finished off the three or four little squares I gave him. Later he ate some oatmeal with strawberries and bananas, drawing at the table while I fed him. </p>
<p>He collected the drum and the drumstick from the laundry room today, and sat down on the floor to play it. I got out the camera, which he has decided over the last week he doesn't like, and frowned with a big "NO!" when I pointed it at him. Interesting. I did manage to sneak in a few in the garden though. </p>
<p>Susan found us in the garden sweeping when she came to pick him up. We had been outside for an hour, with Finn trotting after me, sweeping into the piles of needles that fall from the too-huge-for-out-little-garden tree. He found some blue chalk and wrote on whatever he could find... the table, the benches, and the brick, smiling happily as he did so. </p>
<p>I walked up to the school for Riku at 1:30, and this time we decided to sit in the garden area of the hospital. There weren't any interesting people to talk to, but it was still cool in the shade, and we had a big lawn, a view of the city, and some ants to keep us occupied today. Today Riku had a tiny chocolate brownie cupcake as his treat, after his usual fruit and cheese, and after spotting some ants crawling beside him, decided to treat one of them to a crumb. It was a very tiny crumb, and a much tinier ant, but he was delighted to see it moving the crumb! Down he went on his hands and knees to get a close up view of it all. There was a big long inspection going on there for the longest time! Then he wanted to see if the little family of ants that had gathered would drink some of his juice, so he took a mouthful, leaned down close to the ground and let it slide out. Then it was time to sit back and watching them come and go from that sweet sticky puddle. That was our adventure for today. </p>
<p>I had intended to take Mirei out to the playground for an hour or so, while Riku did his piano practice and homework, but he convinced me that he wanted her to stay home and play with him. He even told me she focuses on something else while he plays and does his homework, but he liked to see her face! Hmm, I wondered later if he didn't like the idea of her going off with me, even though I hadn't mentioned the playground. Maybe there was a little of both thoughts going on. </p>
<p>Doug and I went off to Costco for Akane and then on to Rainbow for fresh produce and stocking up, using a once every month coupon that gives us 20% off. Nice savings when money is tight here. Then it was home for a light dinner, and upstairs to iron while watching some taped shows. Uncle Frank called at that time, so I turned off the iron, and put my feet up for an hour chat with him. He's rethinking about a move into a retirement home so there was lots to discuss. I will be there in just eight days with him! </p>
<p>Doug and I finished off the evening with a rented movie, which we enjoyed very much. </p>
