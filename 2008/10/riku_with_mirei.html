								<h2>Riku with Mirei (Looking Back)</h2>
								<p>January 5th, 2006 â€” I was in Toronto; Akane, Bryn, Riku, and Mirei were in Japan, and I was so touched by this photo that Bryn sent on to me there. I remember thinking that Riku was going to be such a wonderful big brother to this little girl, and now it is two years and nine months later, and still so true. </p>
<p>Riku is a most amazing little boy. He is very tender, very gentle, and very caring with his sister. He holds her hand, watches out for her, and is the first to point out how cute she is when he sees a photo of her. Of course there are the times when she gets into his belongings, or breaks something, or teases him, and he gets frustrated with her, but by far his relationship with her is one of being her very proud big brother.</p>
<p>He was at Disneyland with his Dad last week; Doug, Mirei, and I went to the airport to pick them up after their five day trip, and as I was sitting between them on the way home, Riku kept looking over and smiling at her, telling me how cute she was, and how he had forgotten how cute she was! Cute seems to be the operative word for him, although he knows from his dad and will tell you very seriously that "cute" is not as important as nice. But still... there's his sister and cute she is! </p>
<p>It touches me so deeply to see this little boy be so careful and thoughtful with her. He gave her a panda bear on the way home from the airport, presenting her with it in the car, and then chatted with her about how soft it was, asked if she liked it, and wondered what she would name it. I look forward to seeing this special relationship grow and blossom over the years. I think they are going to be such good friends for many years to come.</p>

<p>In this photo, Riku had just turned three, and Mirei just two weeks.</p>
