								<h2>Wednesday with Two Boys.. and an Unexpected Sleepover</h2>
								<p>Riku and I are becoming power sleepers! Riku woke just a minute before me, giving me a little nudge, and I was shocked to learn that it was 8:45! This meant fifteen minutes less time to get ready for school than we usually have, and that is what works best for me. However, we did it last week too, with just an extra five minutes, so off we went! Thank goodness I did some prep' work again last night, having his oatmeal ready to pop in the microwave, the grapes washed for his lunch, and the lunch containers lined up on the counter, ready to fill. Whew! </p>
<p>In record time Riku dressed and up to the table, he ate his fruit plate while drawing and I got his lunch packed; I then had time to sit at the table with him while he ate his cereal and he finished off his drawing. At 8:20 he was washing his face, brushing his teeth and hair, and ten minutes later we walked out the door at our usual time with no rushing at all. I was so pleased as I know that Riku didn't feel rushed at all, although we did forget to take along the Hallowe'en sticker gift he had made for his teacher last night. </p>
<p>However, we had time to admire the ghostly creature hanging outside a window on the street with the 132 steps. We had seen it yesterday afternoon, being blown about in the wind, and so today we crept past it very very carefully, hoping it wouldn't turn and see us. We were successful! Whew! And Riku looks forward to the skull mask hanging on a door up the hill, touching it three times to hear the messages... "Hey! What are you doing?", and "I  see you!" and I have forgotten the last one. </p>
<p>Kevin was at the house with Finn about ten minutes after I walked in the door. He was such a good little guy, keeping himself busy with the toy kitchen and his favourite push-along bee, so that I got to eat my breakfast and read the paper, chatting with him as he walked back and forth past me. I opened the doors on this beautiful day so that Finn could go outside, and a big bee flew in. This had Finn both fascinated and worried, as it made quite a lot of noise up in the top part of the glass ceiling. Doug was about to try to coax it out with paper and a glass, but it had flown out by the time he got over with them. For the rest of the time though Finn kept checking out for it, as he hadn't seen it disappear. </p>
<p>So, we swept, and he played with water outside, and he ate a big bowl of oatmeal with strawberries, drank lots of water, and carried things inside and out, including the chickens from the living room! They looked pretty good standing out there amongst the leaves and debris! </p>
<p>I picked Riku up at 1:30 and enjoyed our slow walk home, hand in hand, while Riku talked about Hallowe'en and things that scare me, and things that scare him. Even though he doesn't "believe" in ghosts, he does worry about them if he is in a dark room by himself, or even upstairs on his own sometimes. We stopped as usual for Riku to have his snack in the shade at the hospital, before walking home. </p>
<p>Doug and I had decided to try out a fish and chip spot that Bryn had told us about; I usually only eat this dish in Niagara Falls, as there are two spots I particularly like, as I can count on the fish being fresh, tasty, and well cooked. We both liked this casual little spot; the fish is flown in fresh from Ireland every day, but the fish portion was very small, as were the chips, and I thought it expensive for what we got. It was inexpensive for San Francisco though, and I might have been happier if it had been haddock, rather than cod. However, it was a nice change for us, and I'm always happy not to have to cook.</p>
<p>On the way home Susan called from her cell phone. Bryn, at Susan's request, had taken Kevin to the hospital with severe pains in his stomach; he was being monitored and tested to see what the problem was. It sounds scary, as there are several things that could be going on there, one of them being leukemia, as his blood cell count is very low. I headed over asap with a small packed bag for the night, helped Susan get the children ready for bed and tucked in, and at 8:30 she relieved Bryn at the hospital. I fully expected to get wakened by either Finn, who is still not sleeping well at all, or Amelia, who often wakens once or twice as well. I had just gone to bed and was lying there, when I heard Susan come in at  11:30. She went right in with Finn, and I didn't hear either child during the night. </p>
