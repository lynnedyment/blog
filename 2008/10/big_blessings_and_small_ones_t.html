								<h2>Big Blessings and Small Ones Too!</h2>
								<p>Despite expecting to have a broken sleep, anticipating Amelia waking, and possibly Finn too, I ended up with a solid eight hours under my belt. I woke at 7:15, just five minutes before hearing Finn calling "Nana. Nana.", and not long after that saw Susan and Finn waking Amelia up for school! I wish Susan had managed eight hours sleep.</p>
<p>Even though I had my camera with me, it was a typically busy-getting-a-little-one off to school hour and two out the door, with breakfast, chatting, and all the rest of prep' time... so alas, no photos this morning. Amelia and I had been talking about stomach sounds at the table, and so before leaving I lay down on the floor so she could put her ear to my belly. Rumbling water was what was reported. </p>
<p>Finn was his usual busy self, not eating much, but following everyone around, drawing on the chalk board, and putting in his time until he too had to get dressed to get out the door at 8:15. We did it, and dropped Amelia off at 8:30. </p>
<p>She looks adorable in her navy blue "middie" and white blouse, with her little "whale spout" enclosed by a white ribbon. Finn thoroughly enjoyed watching the children at play from his window view, while Susan walked Amelia into the courtyard. </p>
<p>Susan dropped me off at home before 9 A.M., and then was going off to the hospital to check on Kevin... long story short... he has an ulcer. While that is by no means good news, I was so relieved when I received the email from Susan telling me this. There were much worse things that low red blood cells could have meant, and I too was worried about them. Whew! He went home this afternoon, but needs to rest and take it easy for a while. A happy ending to a worrisome 24 hours. A big blessing indeed!</p>
<p>I spent far too long on the family tree today, as I had some very interesting emails in from two sides of Doug's family... the Dyments and the Brewers. It was wonderful to fill in so many blanks, and as a result of hearing from Myrna Dyment, I am well on my way to learning far more about the Connell's side of the family, the maternal link on the paternal side to Doug's story.</p>
<p>How I love working on this project, although always in the back of my mind... well, almost always, there is the thought that I really should be doing something else... ironing, clearing off the counter, sorting and purging things from this house, and this particular time, preparing for a trip to Ontario in just nine days. It's coming up fast. </p>
<p>However, today there was an interesting story about one of the Connell's going off to Oregon with his family, back in the 1800s. They landed there after taking a ship to <strong>Nicaragua</strong> first! What an adventurous family! After twelve years in the Columbia River area known as The Dalles, they returned to Ontario either by train... one story that is part of the family lore, or by travelling with three stage coaches. It will be interesting to see if we can verify one or the other of these stories. </p>
<p>At 1:30 I was on my way up the hill to Starr King, to meet Riku. I was there in time to see him walking through the courtyard hand in hand with his teacher, a woman he likes so much. I was able to get my camera out just as she spotted me and turned him around. </p>
<p>I had prepared his snack so we could once more have a wee picnic on the way home. It has been hot all week, and we were ready for shade again today and decided on a new seat, just outside the doors of SFGH  to continue our conversation while eating. Riku had a choice of cheddar cheese cubes or almonds for his protein, and chose the cheese. It was interesting to hear him say he wasn't very fond of this particular cheese; neither am I. It's an eighteen month cheddar, made in Oregon, but Riku has been spoiled by three and four year old Canadian cheddar, and not coloured orange either. Such a Canadian boy! He ate all his grapes (his favourite fruit right now), and a half slice of "Grandpa's toast" too. </p>
<p>How I love this new routine of ours. Akane picks up Mirei, and they have that time together, and I have an hour with Riku. I haven't had much time with him lately, and not often on his own at that, so I am enjoying every moment of it. We talk about things that happen at school... a girl is being mean to him right now, teasing, and it's good to talk it out and figure out how to deal with it. And we talk about contrails, and interesting people that walk by, and often discover treasures too. And we get to hold hands, walk very slowly, and just enjoy the time between school and homework and piano practice. </p>
<p>Riku always stops to wave goodbye from one of the upstairs windows of his house. Today he stopped in the hallway window outside their apartment, and Mirei joined him in waving. I miss that little girl when I don't see her! I saw her every day for the past two weeks or more, I think, and that smile of hers that lights up the room also lights up my heart. </p>
<p>Doug and I went off to a single malt Scotch tasting event tonight for MacAllan, a "premier whisky". I am not a fan of hard liquor, but it meant a night out, some tasty nibbles, and a nice change from being at home all evening. The nibblies... good cheese, crackers and bread, dried and fresh fruit, and olives were tasty, and we sat with three friendly young whisky afficiandos, so it was a very pleasant evening. We saw some gorgeous photos of Scotland, sipped six different whiskies, and unlike everyone else at the table, I did not prefer the 18 year old Scotch. I did enjoy the squares of Godiva dark chocolate at the end of the evening though. And now it's bedtime, after a very full fun relaxing day.</p>
