								<h2>A Visit with Susan and Finn,</h2>
								<p>I had offered to have Finn this morning and was expecting to hear from Susan earlier, but Finn had decided he wanted to stay home and watch a rented movie instead. Susan was sure that wouldn't last long, but I didn't hear anything more. </p>
<p>And then, about noon, the door bell rang and Finn had his nose pushed against the glass, calling out "Hi Nana!" He and Susan had gone out, stopped to pick up some yummy food for us to eat together. There was a vegetarian croque monsieur (with mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, and a really earthy cheese), a high and light veggie quiche, a quiche Lorraine for Susan and Finn, and a lemon tart for dessert. Yum! </p>
<p>Finn, however, could not be talked into having a bite of any of the quiche, or the pistachios Susan opened for him (usually a sure thing), or the grapes I offered that he rarely refuses. He had his mind set on using the hose, but it was cold outside, Finn was coughing, and Susan hadn't planned to stay long as Finn needed his nap. He was furious with her for not giving in, and finally after much patience on Susan's part, it was obvious that he really just needed to sleep. </p>
<p>They went off, with Finn waving goodbye from the back seat of the car. Less than a half hour later Susan sent me a sweet photo of sleeping Finn. It's an interesting photo of him, as I can so clearly see what he might look like as a young teenager in his face. </p>
<p>About an hour later Doug left to go to a double feature movie. My five or so hours alone swept by too quickly, but I enjoyed the time and the evening with Doug too. We didn't watch a DVD tonight as Doug was movied out, but I got lots of computer related work done while I had Doug here with me.  </p>
