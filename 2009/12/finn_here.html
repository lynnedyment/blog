								<h2>Brr-r-r! ... and a Visit with Finn</h2>
								<p>Finn was over for a visit this morning, and he and Susan were both chilled when they arrived at the house. Susan mentioned how warm the house was, as they have no central heating at their place, and the two space heaters don't keep the flat quite as warm as would be ideal during this cold spell we're having right now. Finn's little hands were so cold and he didn't want to take his cozy polar fleece off until he had been here for over half an hour. </p>
<p>Finn instantly carried out the big six-quart basket of assorted cars once Susan left. I so wish I had snapped a photo of him lining the little Tonka-style cars up all along the edge of the laundry room door. Riku did exactly the same thing, although usually on the bed. Finn had them lined up perfectly, fronts of the cars against the door, and tucked in closely beside one another.</p>
<p>He asked if he could play upstairs today, so off we went. I plugged in the iron and got all that done up as Finn sat on the floor with the big blocks, the race track, the balls in the holes game, and the cars too. I laughed as several times today he would come out with "Oh, <strong>man</strong>!" and proceed to do whatever it was that he was doing. </p>
<p>Finn wanted to play with the Lincoln Log set, so after tiding up together, and singing the "clean up" song, out came the logs. And Doug walked in at the perfect moment, as I am not a house builder at all, and Doug sat with Finn on the floor and built a fine little house. Finn had a great time with it, closing off the door with a "big stick" and putting a little boy figure inside; very entertaining for him! </p>
<p>I sang a few songs to him as I ironed; he liked the "current buns" song, and stopped to watch me sway back and forth as I sang "Did you ever see a lassie?" He told me he didn't know <strong>that</strong> song and asked me to sing it three times. The ironing disappeared in no time, and Finn sat beside me on the bed and watched me sew a button on a shirt too. Nice to have these jobs out of the way and Finn still got lots of attention too. </p>
<p>At one point he heard a siren and so I stood him on top of the dresser until we spotted it and watched it travelling along Potrero Avenue. </p>
<p>It was lunch time so I made grilled cheese sandwiches and sat with him while he played with the "lock board", having great fun with the keys and seeing the pictures inside once we got the locks undone. He used the peg board too, although lost interest in it pretty quickly, returning to the locks instead. </p>
<p>We had one of our favourite "Get those feet off my table(!) moments too which made Finn giggle away. </p>
<p>He was ready for his nap just as Susan came in, but took the time to go upstairs with his mom and show her his house. Susan sent a message later saying Finn was asleep twenty minutes after they left. </p>
<p>It's cold everywhere! Bryn sent a photo of Riku in three layers walking to school on this cold-in-Japan-too morning. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched the last of Billy Connolly's World Tour of Australia last night and we're looking forward to the next set. </p>
