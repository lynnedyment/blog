								<h2>A First ... All Day at Home</h2>
								<p>This morning felt like a school day, as Riku has a field trip today, and he and Akane had to leave the house at 8:40 A.M. Riku and I enjoyed our slow waking up together time first, though, and then Mirei quietly slid open the door to see if we were awake. Seeing that we were (we had been very quiet), she said "Oh, you're already awake!" and joined us in bed for a little bit. But soon they were both up and on the move. I sat with them while they had their fruit and breakfast, and left showering until after Riku and Akane departed. </p>
<p>It's dreary again today, with no sun in sight. Mirei went up to her dad's office and played on the floor while he worked and I showered, and then we played in her room, did some reading on the sofa together, and I laughed at all her funny faces. What an entertainer she is! I just cannot wait to see what this little girl chooses to do with her life. I hope she never loses her zany and uninhibited sense of silliness. </p>
<p>I was just plain sore today. No idea why, but I was very comfy sitting on the sofa while Mirei played with and around me. Akane and Riku had lunch out together, and enjoyed the Botanical Garden trip, especially since the rain held off for them. </p>
<p>Riku did his piano practice, his spelling, and his reading, having that all out of the way early in the day. Akane made my favourite noodle dish for dinner, along with lots of edamame and steamed carrots. Mirei will eat an entire bowl of the edamame on her own, before Riku or anyone else even notices. She is expert at getting them out of the pods in the most efficient way, and now I know enough to put some on Riku's plate, and to take some for myself, before Mirei gets to them. Both children eat such a wonderful variety of foods, but whereas Mirei loves to eat, Riku mostly just eats what he has to. Once in a while he will polish off his plate quickly, but he would rather do almost anything else other than sit at the table and just eat. </p>
<p>Bryn bathed the children again tonight; it has become his "job" since I fell, and Akane and I cleaned up the kitchen together. I read a nice long story to Riku, and he was asleep quickly. He was tired after his three hours of tromping about the garden, with all that fresh air. </p>
<p>Akane fell asleep with Mirei tonight, and I sat at her computer catching up on my blog and emails, and later, when Bryn went out for a drink, I went through dozens and dozens of photos on his computer, searching out the perfect blog pics for the last few days. He has not had time to add them to my blogs, so Doug will be doing these when I get back home. I am thankful for this team that keeps my blogs going! </p>
<p>Bedtime at 11 P.M. for me tonight ... feeling sad as the time to leave comes ever closer. </p>
