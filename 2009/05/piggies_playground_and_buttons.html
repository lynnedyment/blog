								<h2>A Surprise Breakfast, Piggies, Playground, and Buttons!</h2>
								<p>I slept well again last night, with just one too-long trip to the bathroom in the night. Finding the toilet seat <strong>down</strong>, once I made it there, almost had me in tears, as bending down that low to lift it just seemed like too much to ask. Crazy! My back stiffens right up and lifting myself, even while holding on to the arms of the sofa, just has me sweating buckets. Oy vey! I shall give thanks every day for a healthy back, as soon as it is back to normal. I guess not ever having had back problems has spoiled me for being able to move quickly and in whatever direction I choose! </p>
<p>Darling Riku came downstairs at 6:30 this morning. He told me he had been in his room "thinking", waiting for 6:30, which is a shame, as I too had been lying there listening for any quiet footsteps upstairs. He went right into the kitchen today to make me a "surprise"; I could hear the fridge door opening and closing, and he quietly went to the hutch and took out a bowl, and headed back to the kitchen. Not much later, he came in proudly bearing a bowl of fresh fruit for me. What a lucky Nana I am! I was so touched; what a kind thing to do this was, and all his own idea too. </p>
<p>Bryn went out for breakfast at 7:30, to work at his caf√© again today, and the morning flew by. I stayed on the sofa for a while, with both children buzzing about me. The children played so well together, with Mirei changing clothes like an Oscar winner attending a dozen parties. Riku, being her official "dresser", announced her entrance. "Ladies and gentlemen! Here is Queen Elizabeth!" It was hilarious, and they kept busy for so long entertaining each other.</p>
<p>When Riku went off for some quiet time on his own, Mirei entertained me, kissing my hand, making sure I was comfortable, sitting beside me with all her bags and backpacks, and ribbons and bows, and chatting up a storm. She reminds me of Caillie, more and more so. She combed my hair carefully, I put her hair in "piggies" again today, and then while they ate the rest of their breakfast I took a long hot shower and felt much better after that. </p>
<p>By 11 A.M. it was time for some fresh air. It was a gorgeous day, and Riku wanted to play with somebody. We walked over to the child's house around the corner (where Riku had played yesterday), but were told by a neighbour that he and his family were out for a bike ride. We came back home to collect Mirei. Bryn had just arrived home, Akane was heading out to run errands, and off we went, stopping to pick up Yuu-kun.</p>
<p>The boys walked ahead of us, waiting at the corners until the last block. They went racing up the steps, as did Mirei, until she noticed me lagging behind. She walked back down to me, gently took my hand, and told me she would help me, with the most concerned expression on her face. "It's okay, Nana. You will feel better soon." Sweet girl. </p>
<p>There were only two children there, a brother and a sister, and not too long after we arrived, they were all checking out all the bugs they could find. Two women came, one to cut the other's hair, so that totally fascinated the children for about ten minutes. Soon another boy came on his own, and there was Frisbee playing, running and chasing, dashes up and down the slide, and more bug searching. Mirei sat for the longest time at the side of the sandbox, playing with two little girls who had arrived later. I wasn't comfortable sitting or standing, and was happy to be on the way home again an hour and a bit later. Akane was on her way out and Bryn was just arriving home. </p>
<p>My back felt close to spasm (I was so uncomfortable at the playground, not being able to stand for long, and not happy trying to get up and down for the fairly low bench either), and I was hurting too much when we got home. Bryn made grilled cheese sandwiches for the children with lots of veggies while I put my feet up. I haven't had much of an appetite since my fall, and am not even interested in all my big cups of milky tea either. After a while though, I did eat a nice big portion of a soba noodle, cabbage, and other veggie soup I had made the other day. </p>
<p>It was a gorgeous day, and Akane did three loads of laundry. I have hung up my last clothing for this trip, as there is no way I can navigate down to the two cement blocks from the sliding glass door any longer. However, Riku and Mirei sorted the clothes into each of our piles ... laughing at my bra(!), and everyone's underwear ... all very funny obviously! Mirei stuck to it and helped by handing her mom every piece of laundry until the job was done. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn were in and out on various errands, but once home got started on the usual list of things to do. Riku's hair was getting long, and I was hoping to see it cut before going home. I love his hair fairly short. Since he was too hot and sweaty while playing the piano, Akane cut his hair herself for the first time in a long time (he had been going to my hair cutter in San Francisco for the past few cuts). She set up his chair so that he could watch  "Night at the Museum", which of course was nice for him, but not so easy to cut his hair with all the laughing and trying to see the screen as well. He has such thick hair and we all laughed at all the hair on his back, telling him he looked just like his Grandpa and his great-grandpa too, my dad. I like hairy men and Riku knows this, but it looked like it must have tickled like mad! </p>
<p>Bryn showered with Riku, and then set off with him to a toy store to choose a special toy for his night on his own. They left at 4:40, with plans to meet up with Akane and Mirei at 5:30 for dinner out. I declined to go with them, as I couldn't imagine climbing up and down on a bus or even having to stay in one position for long, especially if it were at a chair-less spot, as is typical here of many of their favourite restaurants.</p>
<p>I had a little quiet time first, though, with Mirei, which was very nice at the end of my day with her. We went outside and blew bubbles for a half hour; we both had a great time! She would blow lots of them and at one point I said "There are a million of them!" and after that she would say it too any time she blew more than a dozen of them. Nice little video of this too. </p>
<p>She has been practicing over and over and over yesterday and today undoing and doing up the buttons on the blouses she was wearing, and must have said to me in a big voice three times in an hour "Look Nana! I can do my buttons all by myself!". She is so proud of herself and should be too; she's been working hard at this. After this, she was unbuttoning and buttoning buttons whenever and wherever she could, just to keep in practice! </p>
<p>She and Akane left at 5:20 for the bus, and I got busy immediately on the computer, catching up on older blogs that Bryn has attached photos to already. It took me a while to get my little comfort zone perfect ... two thin pillows on the seat, one thick one behind my back, and a heating pad tucked in between. Not hungry for dinner,  I did treat myself to a small cup of hot chocolate and a piece of yummy whole grain toast at 8:30. </p>
<p>The time passed very quickly, and at 7:20 the family walked in the door. They had dessert, did the bedtime routine, but of course had their showers/tubs earlier, Mirei got to wear her sunny new yellow pineapple PJs and looked adorable; Riku had new PJs too, watched a little big of TV, but was tired and more than ready for his bed. </p>
<p>We read the book about Galileo again; he was asleep late though, not being able to settle in the hot night, and finally succumbed at close to 9, with that darned glowing light still. Bryn took it down and placed it face down on Mirei's bed; Akane is mystified as to why there is a light that doesn't turn off! I was too uncomfortable tonight to fall asleep, which was a good thing for which my back was grateful.</p>
<p>Akane and Bryn were online, searching for bookcases and wall units during the evening, and I was just too sore to walk up the stairs to Bryn's computer or to even think about asking him to bring it down. Bryn helped me make up my bed very early, crawled in and read a bit, wrote a few blog notes, and dozed off and on for a bit in between. Bryn left at ten to go for a drink, just a five minute walk away, his first night out since they moved in. I was vaguely aware of him standing in the doorway some time later.</p>
