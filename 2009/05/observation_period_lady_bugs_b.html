								<h2>Observation Class With Riku, Lady Bugs Bite!, Mirei the Entertainer, and Cherries Too!</h2>
								<p>Riku was very quiet walking to school today, with lots on his mind, really had to make an effort to smile at our favourite lady, and wasn't interested in engaging in conversation with a friendly man walking his dog, a man determined to talk to Riku and finally succeeding.</p>
<p>We spotted a heron on the edge of the water, and talked about nesting, and eggs, and food for the water birds. Finally, just as I was leaving him at school, Riku told me they had planted flowers in pots outside their classroom windows. He wanted me to see them, so I walked outside to the back of the class, and saw all the little pots filled with soil and upturned water bottles. Leaning out the window, Riku pointed to his, and several other children came to join him. I took a couple of shots of happy smiling children, including our little guy. </p>
<p>I walked slowly home, taking a few photos of the school again, with the freshly planted vegetable gardens in the foreground, and then walked along the river for a few blocks as well. I wasn't quite ready to head home. I took some photos of another heron on her nest. It was a lovely morning, and I enjoyed the quiet time and the fresh air. I was feeling so much better than yesterday morning, and am so grateful that I am healing more quickly than I expected to be.</p>
<p>It's a blowy hot day, and I put one load of wash in, and got that out on the line after all, by walking along a narrow path at the side of the house, thus avoiding the impossible-to-get-down (at the moment) cement blocks from the dining room. I thought I wouldn't be helping with any more laundry, until I realized there was a way around it. I got a second load ready to hang out too, and managed to do it before leaving the house later on. I even did up the dishes, although my back was letting me know that enough was enough by that time! </p>
<p>Akane came back home right after dropping Mirei off; she was on her computer, so I got busy sending off some birthday/post cards, while Akane booked my door-to-door shuttle for Monday. This is a bargain; only $40.00  for the  trip ... no bus (or taxi), no train, no transfer to another train to the airport, and it might even be cheaper. I am booked for pick-up at 12:30 Monday, and since I will need help lifting my case and the one box I will be taking with me, Akane booked a porter service as well. There may be red-caps there, but neither Bryn nor Akane are sure of this, and at $4.00 per piece, this too is a bargain. Nice to have that all taken care of and not be worrying about how I will manage. I am particularly happy that Bryn won't have to spend hours of his day off travelling all that way with me. </p>
<p>Akane was also trying to get me in to see a doctor again, if only to get more pain meds for the trip. However, as cheap as it is to be treated here, it can be very time consuming. The best plan seemed to be to go to the hospital tomorrow, where they have my records, so that X-rays didn't need to be retaken (which I wouldn't have wanted to do anyway). But to go there meant getting to the hospital at 7:30 to get a number, waiting until the clinic opens at 8:30, and then — since it is such a busy place — waiting possibly two or three hours, Akane said, to be seen. It's all complicated by Mirei being in school, and Akane needing to be there to pick her up at noon tomorrow (not the usual 4 P.M.), and of course my needing Akane at the hospital as a translator! It's all too involved, and I decided later in the evening that I would try to get by on fewer pain meds in the next few days and stockpile some for that flight home. I am feeling better as well, and in six more days ... I might not need them at all! </p>
<p>I made a yummy brunch of sauteed tomatoes, scrambled eggs, two small slices of delicious grainy toast, and a big cup of tea. Mom would have enjoyed it as much as I did! Tasted like home, when I was a child ... comfort food for sure.</p>
<p>Akane and Bryn went out for lunch together, and to run some errands, and so I sat with a heat pack on my back and typed away like mad. </p>
<p>Today there is a second monthly 45-minute class open to the parents and relatives of the grade one classes, and I was delighted to be here for this again. Akane and Bryn arrived home, and we were ready to leave together for school. However, I set out on my own, to walk at my own slower pace, and met them at the door at 2:45. </p>
<p>I could see Riku searching for us in the sea of faces, and he broke into a big smile when he met my eyes. We were lucky enough to get the same spot at the back of his class, leaning against a counter, as we did the last time, and this gave me a great vantage point for taking photos and videos of Riku and the class. </p>
<p>Today they were learning to identify which row was where ... second row from the left, third row from the right, etc. and when the teacher called it out, the children had to point to the row she was referring to. It was loud! So was the "bingo" style game with numbers, but the children had a great time with it all. </p>
<p>I like the teacher very much. She is energetic, tolerant, obviously enjoys her job, and keeps the children focused and interested. Riku sits in the front row of the second aisle from the door, and I think it's a great spot for him. He is more likely to be engaged in what is going on if he's there in front; he's a dreamer and that would be easier in the middle of the classroom. He likes his desk-mate too, a six-year-old girl.</p>
<p>The teacher really impressed me when Riku pointed out a spider crawling between his and his desk-mate's desks. She picked it up carefully, walked over to the window with it, and let it go. She got an A+ from me for that move. </p>
<p>We started our walk toward the bridge together, with Akane and Bryn ahead of us with their umbrellas, to shade them from the hot sun, and Riku and I holding hands walking along looking for ladybugs. Riku picked one up and, much to his surprise a bit later, it bit him! I have never had this happen to me, ever, and Riku was not pleased. He has decided that perhaps ladybugs are no longer his favourite insect. </p>
<p>We split up after the walk across the bridge, as Riku has a 45-minute Chinese class on Wednesday afternoons, and Bryn was heading home to leave to pick Mirei up at 4 P.M. Akane and Riku went off to the bus, and I walked with Bryn.</p>
<p>We were both very glad to be in the house, as it is a hot day again. After Bryn left, I got the second load of laundry in from the line and folded, and then sat down with a very achy back and a hot pack, after taking my first pain pill of the day. At that point, going without meds didn't seem to be a plan that will work. It's frustrating as, except for the pain, I am so much more mobile than I was. </p>
<p>Bryn came walking in with Mirei at 4:45, dressed in the sweetest little black cotton dress, looking like a little French maid. Bryn and I had such a wonderful hour or so with her. She was feeling silly ... no surprise there(!), and insisted that I take lots of photos of her making faces, so she could instantly look at them, laugh out loud at them, and then insist on yet another silly pose. What a girl this is! </p>
<p>There is a sweetness to Mirei as well, though. I had cooked up the last of the pasta, along with some veggies for Mirei's dinner, and there wasn't quite enough for the three of us (Riku and Akane had dinner out). Bryn insisted that I have the portion left after we served Mirei's, and Mirei asked "How about you, Daddy?" He asked what she meant, and she answered "What are you going to eat for <strong>your</strong> dinner?" He assured her he would be fine, and in fact ended up eating the last of her pasta, since she had a very generous and healthy snack before dinner. She must have been so thirsty on this hot day, as I swear she drank a quart of liquids between getting home and bedtime. </p>
<p>Bryn showered/tubbed with Mirei after dinner, and how I loved hearing them laughing and chatting in the shower. It's right off the kitchen and with a folding door so it's easy to hear all that's going on. He shampoos her hair, and talks to her all the way through the water routine; it's adorable. She was all ready for bed at 6:30, with her bright yellow jammies on, and her hair combed out, when Akane and Riku walked in. </p>
<p>I was sitting on the sofa when Riku came into the living room, and he was so excited and just had to show me something right away: fresh cherries! He and I both love them, and they had bought a small basket of them on the way home. Yum! Akane said they were quite expensive but it was worth the price just to see the expression on Riku's face as he pulled out the stem on two of them, washed them, and brought them back so we could eat them together. I hope he always thinks of me when he eats cherries. </p>
<p>It was a rushed evening for sure for Riku, as he had a quick tub, and then his homework to do, although it took only three minutes, if that, as it was very basic adding and subtracting, with pictures to help out. </p>
<p>The Co-op delivered groceries today, and since we weren't home, it was left at the door with dry ice keeping it cold. Riku's treat after homework was done was to observe that dry ice in a bowl Bryn set out for him, and did he love it! It was such fun to watch his face as he watched the "smoke" moving around, covered it with a book, and asked lots of questions. </p>
<p>I wanted to tuck him in tonight, as my nights left here are too few. We looked at a Japanese book of the solar system, and Riku pointed out a green moon, and a blue moon ... not sure what they are(!) ... but loved to hear him say "Aren't they just amazing?" and "Isn't it incredible?" </p>
<p>It was so hot up in his room tonight, and Riku, who usually settles in quickly after his story, was very restless. He lay quietly for a few minutes, and then came out with "Man, I just can't sleep!". I reassured him that sleep will come, that he just needed to lie quietly and perhaps count to himself. I got him into lighter-weight  PJs, and that helped, but Bryn also came in and opened the window a crack and that did the trick. It was 8:30 before he was asleep, though ... too late for this early riser, after such a long busy day! </p>
<p>Akane fell asleep with Mirei, Bryn was upstairs working, and I had a little extra time for some family tree work on Akane's computer. This was just perfect timing, as once again I was so excited because Gail and I have had contact with a distant relative in England on our Mom's father's side, with information we have never had before! I could stay up until the early hours, working on this, but won't. Instead I blogged and went to bed, sleeping in my own tatami room for the first time in many days. </p>
