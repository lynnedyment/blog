								<h2>Kyoto to San Francisco</h2>
								<p>I had a very restless last night, awake every hour or two, off and on throughout the entire night. Each time I felt as though three or four hours had passed, only to find a mere hour had. I had a lot on my mind ... leaving the children for so long, how the flight would go when I wouldn't be able to move much to get comfortable, how many pain tablets I had left, whether I should get up and take two right away, but most of it was upset, hating the thought of not seeing these children for six months. They will have changed so much by then, and I know how much I will be missing. I'm hoping I sleep on this flight, not something I usually do, but today it would be bliss. </p>
<p>Riku woke at 6:15, after hearing Mirei upstairs. He just bounces out of bed, but there is always a ten-minute coming 'round period too, when he is still slumbering, and wraps his arm around the back of my neck. Tonight he will be back upstairs, sleeping in his own bed, and being a big boy again. </p>
<p>I put the kettle on for Akane's and Bryn's tea, made the fruit plates for the children, one for myself today too, and showered, letting the hot water relax those tight muscles in my back. Then I sat with the children as they ate their breakfast; Mirei had <strong>two</strong> fried eggs this morning with her toast and ate every bite of it. Riku had his usual one, plus cereal with blueberries, and got to play with a funny little recording device. He and I both spoke sentences one at a time, and then he howled with laughter each time we heard them played back, as our voices were somewhat distorted and often interrupted the previous sentence. </p>
<p>Mirei helped me with my socks for the very last time today, even though I was attempting to put them on myself. She insisted, and told me that Grandpa could help me when I go home. "Soon you will be all better, Nana!" and yes, I shall. Can't wait! </p>
<p>It's a gorgeous day here today; I'm so glad I didn't leave yesterday when it was grey and drizzly all day long. Doug emailed to say there had been a hot spell, which has broken, and so it's going to be lovely on both ends of my (long) day. </p>
<p>I said goodbye to Mirei at the door, and made it quick, as she really has no idea how long it will be before we see each other again. I was feeling pretty teary, and I didn't want her to be sad. I got a nice kiss and a gentle hug earlier too, and a wave goodbye as Riku and I left for school at 8:05. Bryn will be walking Riku to school from now on; I'm going to miss our walks each day, as I did when he left San Francisco. It's always a lovely way to start off a weekday. </p>
<p>Riku spotted a long thin worm today as we walked along, and there was time for him to stop for a good look at it. It was moving fast, which really surprised Riku, and he asked me to tell his parents that he had seen his first live worm! Apparently he has seen only dead ones, which is hard to imagine, and even though I looked for it on the way home as promised, he/she had disappeared. We talked about buying a box of worms, maybe a hundred or more, and letting them loose in his back yard to make it healthier, and he thought it would be fun to dig them up too, and see how they were doing. We always check for the heron near the river, and we saw just his head and neck today; he was very still and must have been looking for breakfast. </p>
<p>And of course today I got to say "goodbye" to everyone, and not just "good morning". First was our friendly neighbour around the corner, then the principal who took my photo with Riku for me, a couple of the moms we always pass, and finally a group of boys who often greet us in the morning. I took two photos of them, so it will be fun to see all those familiar faces once I get home. Riku and I had a private kiss and hug before we got to his classroom, and then a long hug on his way back from getting a drink at the fountain down the hall. I had a hard time with that final goodbye and delayed it as long as possible. We waved to each other all the way down to the end of the corridor, before he went into this classroom. </p>
<p>I had a letter to mail to Skylar, Riku's "friend" from Starr King in San Francisco, so I walked the long way home leaving me to come up to the mailbox from the streets below us. It paid off, as I hoped it would, as I got to say goodbye to Mirei's "snowman" lady who was sitting outside her door in a chair, watching the gardening going on in the plot next to her home. That made my day, and I was so pleased to wave goodbye to her, and to take her photo too! </p>
<p>I put my bedding in the washer, got Bryn to hang up the two duvets we used, and then had breakfast and finished up my packing. My pick-up is at 12:50, for my 5:30 P.M. flight. I dashed off an email to my sisters, letting them know what time I would be in. Strange, as I leave at 5:30 tonight, Monday, and will be arriving in San Francisco at 11 A.M. today!</p>
<p>I had a big fruit plate for my breakfast with a few nuts; Akane came right back from dropping Mirei off at school and made me a wonderful packed lunch for my trip ... those yummy noodles with veggies and tofu that we had on Saturday, five inari (I like Akane's more than any I have tasted) and (I was delighted to find) a bag with lots of fresh carrot sticks too. It was all packed carefully with napkins and wooden chopsticks as well! Lucky me! </p>
<p>I had so much I wanted to take, and got right at it ... some photos of the upstairs, pics of the hole I had dropped into, a frozen juice slushie for each of the children, and a note to them each. I was just finishing off Riku's when the shuttle arrived, ten minutes early, but of course by the time the suitcases were packed, and I was in and settled, with the bill paid, it was exactly 12:50. Gail and Tom had thoughtfully dashed off some mega painkillers for me in the mail, and it turned out that after I had said goodbye to Akane and Bryn, and just pulled away from the house, Bryn checked the mail box and found they were there! They hadn't been fifteen minutes earlier, as I had checked. Too bad, as this might have made the trip a little more comfortable for me. </p>
<p>We drove into Kyoto to pick up an American couple from NYC, very friendly people, who had just finished up their three-month world tour in Kyoto. We chatted on the way to the airport, and it was lovely having company. We arrived at the airport at exactly 3 P.M., a half hour earlier than Akane had requested the porter, to help with my bags. However, the fellow at the curbside, along with my very nice driver, managed to get him there earlier for me. He was an enthusiastic, friendly young man, and took care of all of my bags, staying with me until they were loaded on the weigh scale. We waited less than five minutes to get to the check-in counter. </p>
<p>By this time I was ready for my first cup of tea of the day, so stopped at a Starbuck's cafe before going to my gate. Once I had that in hand, I realized I was hungry and so ate half of my noodle dish and an inari too, both so tasty! Then I was off to the gate area to read until my flight was called. The woman from the shuttle bus tracked me down to ask how I was doing, and, when it was time to board, an American fellow, who was passing by as I struggled to get out of my seat, offered to carry my bag on board for me. </p>
<p>I had changed my seat at the check-in counter, hoping that I might end up with two seats at the back of the plane to myself, and I lucked out! It was just perfect, as I could still sit by the window for the view and the extra leaning space, but not have to struggle past anyone when I wanted to get up to move a bit. I put my four hot packs on my back, and settled in for the long flight home. </p>
<p>It all went very well, much better than I hoped, as there was enough room that I could fidget at will. I watched a movie, did lots of reading, slept for perhaps an hour, enjoyed the rest of my meal from Akane, except for the inari, which I plan to enjoy here at home, and enjoyed the little meals that were part of the trip ... dinner, and a snack shortly before landing. I always get hungry on planes, so having the extra meal was a plus for me. </p>
<p>We landed a little bit early, and it was such a treat to walk out and find Doug waiting for me. It is good to be home, and I know I will be taking it much easier here, not having the temptation of walking with the children. </p>
<p>I had zero energy for the rest of the day, happy to lie about reading magazines, checking email once in a while, and napped about 1 P.M. for just an hour while lying on the sofa. It was wonderful to have Doug taking care of me, making me tea, and heating up some dinner for us. I was awake enough to watch a movie with him too, which ended at 11, and then turned in for the night, with two pillows tucked around me. Home.</p>
