								<h2>A Teacher, a Principal,  Lots of "Hello"s and the Dancing Duo</h2>
								<p>Okay, it was bloody hard getting out of bed this morning ... all the way from the floor up seemed an especially long way, after taking no pain meds the night before, but I sure did like waking up in my "own" bed. I had a rough night without that to deal with, as I had trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, and was awake every twenty minutes or so from 4 A.M. </p>
<p>The rest of my day was great! I had a long long hot shower, nice and early before the family awoke. We had a great morning with the children today.They were up early enough that they had lots of free time this morning. </p>
<p>Riku (aka Mr. Dyment)  and Mirei (his student and, strangely enough, his daughter too!) started off by playing school as soon as they were dressed. So while their breakfast was being prepared, Riku was busy asking Mirei math questions (which he answered for her in whispers), and "checking" her homework. They both had backpacks filled with papers and books, and amused themselves very nicely. When it was time to eat, I told the "teacher" that it was his break time and he should come to the teacher's lounge, while Mirei sat two seats away in the "lunch room". They actually had time for two fifteen-minute "breaks" to leave the table and continue with their role-playing. </p>
<p>Riku left the house right at 8 A.M., a minute before me, and was down at the corner of the street when I walked out. I called out to him, and he turned back, grinning at me. Mr. Independent! I imagine he will be walking to school on his own within the next month or so, although I don't know, he sure likes having someone to walk and talk with, and his dad and I like it too. </p>
<p>Since we left in good time, it meant it was a "meandering" walk to school (no rushing at all). Mirei insists on kissing and hugging him before he leaves, and I must try to get a photo of this sweet goodbye at the door. (Her "good night"s to him are equally enthusiastic and loving.)</p>
<p>Lots of children regularly saying "good morning" or "hello!" in English to me now. Other children overhear it, then say it too, and the next day they come right up to greet me. </p>
<p>Today, thinking Riku might like a little more independence, I asked him if he would like me to leave him before entering the courtyard area, and walk to his classroom on his own. He surprised me by saying, "Nana, I never want you to do that. I always want you to come with me." That may have changed when I am back again in November, so I'll continue to enjoy that extra few minutes with him. </p>
<p>Rain was threatening this morning, so we went prepared with brollies and raincoats but, despite the heavy breeze and the slightly threatening darkness, it never happened. It did cool down last night and we were all glad it did. Sleeping is so much easier when it's cool in those upstairs bedrooms! </p>
<p>Mirei was out of school at noon today, so she and Akane had lunch out, as they always do on Wednesdays. Bryn cooked himself a pizza, and shared a tiny piece with me, as it smelled soooo good, but I was having a delicious kabocha squash croquette that Akane had picked up for me, along with a banana and the last of the almonds from SF. </p>
<p>Mirei was in my room with me, lounging about on my bed, at 2:35 when Riku peeked into the open window to say hello to us! I didn't expect him home until 2:45. They must have gotten out at 2:15, but he told me he was ahead of everyone all the way home, except for one boy, and that he (Riku) had run all the way! That would be quite the feat actually, with his heavy backpack.  :)</p>
<p>Riku did his piano practice early today, plus his second lot of easy homework, while Mirei and I went up to her room, with a big stack of books to read. However, she got distracted with bags of toys at her end of the room, so I started sorting through Riku's clothes, once more getting them into piles of short-sleeved shirts, long sleeved, PJs, etc. Bryn came in at one point, and went downstairs with the stack of short-sleeved shirts, and had Riku try them on, and Akane decide what to keep and what could be given away. One pile down, five to go! But just getting them sorted made him happy, as he can now see the top of his dresser. </p>
<p>Mirei has to take two blown eggs to school next Monday for a project, and so Bryn and Riku took care of this. Bryn punched the holes carefully into the shells, and then he had Riku break the yolks, while he blew them out. Riku decided it was too yucky to do himself, but he sure did enjoy watching the whole process, and taking part in the clean part of it too. </p>
<p>Riku and Mirei started to watch a Japanese movie he had wanted to see; however, they sat through about a half hour of it, and started playing "teacher" again, so off went the TV, and not too much later Riku was in the tub for a long play, and then Mirei. </p>
<p>While Mirei tubbed, Riku did his reading, from a great book in which he loves the illustrations by Chris Van Allsburg. No story, but lots of room for imagining what the story might be, with a hint from the one line provided with each picture. Interesting book for sure! It's called "The Mysteries of Harris Burdick".</p>
<p>Bryn helped Akane with some of the dinner prep', and we had a most delicious meal. Mirei spotted mine and wanted it, of course ... brown rice with a perfectly cooked fried egg on top of it, and a wonderful new dish, to me, of a special kind of seaweed, with thin strips of tofu and carrot cooked in with it. Akane told me that a lot of restaurants in SF serve this, as it is a popular macrobiotic dish. Yum! I loved it and ate lots of it. The rest of the family ate two different types of fish, one raw, and a smoked salmon, with an egg foo yung type dish with crab. </p>
<p>There was some time for the children to dance together after dinner, and it was such fun to see that I taped some of it, and took photos too. Riku was twirling Mirei around and they did some improv' too. Adorable! </p>
<p>A much cooler night meant an earlier night for both children. Riku asleep at 7:45 and Mirei not much later. Bryn and Akane went off to the clinic for a follow-up visit for Bryn. They came back bearing 21 tablets the doctor gave Bryn for pain, which he doesn't feel he needs, so gave them to me (I have given up on the notion of doing without pain meds!). Coincidentally, they are the same tablets that I was prescribed ten of, so that will more than cover my next few days' needs. </p>
<p>I went to bed early and read ... the perfect end to my day. </p>
