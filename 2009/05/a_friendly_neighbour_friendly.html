								<h2>A Friendly Neighbour,  More Friendly Faces, and a Lovely Walk to Riku's Piano Lesson</h2>
								<p>Oh, I was one sore woman today! Standing in one spot is what I find the hardest thing to do, so the little bit of it I did last night did me in. I felt fine while I was doing it, but getting up in the night was almost as bad as it was the second or third night. Even after my usual long hot shower, I just hurt everywhere. Arggh! I will be happy when I can just bounce out of bed again, and not have to rely on the children helping me put my socks on. It is sweet, though, that they are both happy to put on one sock each to help me out! </p>
<p>Riku and I left at 8 for school today, and once he was in his classroom, I spotted a young boy with a marvelous bright green bug on his hand. I admired it, went back in to get Riku, and soon we had a big group of children gathered 'round to see it as well. I let it crawl on me, as Riku was afraid it was poisonous. Someone at school has been telling him that most of the bugs they see are poisonous and he believes them! I am determined to prove them wrong.I think the children were very impressed with my bravery! </p>
<p>On my way home, I took a route that had me pass by a man whom I see each day,tending to his flowers in front of his house. I have never spoken to him, as he is almost always crouching, but I did sneak a photo of him from the back one day. Today his neighbour, a man, was coming out of his door, but I was on the street, and moving fast enough that I didn't have to try to decide whether to speak to him or not. I rarely do to men, especially ones over fifty or so, as they rarely seem approachable, though of course there are exceptions. But making that decision wasn't necessary today. </p>
<p>Much to my surprise, when I was a few yards ahead of this fellow, I heard him call out "good morning" to me in Japanese. I turned and returned his greeting, and he went on to speak to me, in pretty good English, asking many questions: where was I staying, where did I live (I always volunteer that I am "Canada-jin" — "from Canada" — but live in SF), and then how long was my visit. I used fingers to tell him, and he understood, and then told him I was flying back in three days. He bowed and said goodbye and smiled when I said goodbye to him in Japanese. Encounters like this make me happy! </p>
<p>Last weekend I was out walking with the children, and a man passed by us, greeting the children by name! I had no idea who he was, and neither did the children, but later in the week, the same fellow passed by again, greeting me warmly. He lives just two doors down the street from us, but I had never met him before. Some of the locals are certainly curious about this new family in the neighbourhood, and have gone out of their way to meet and greet Akane, Bryn, and the children ... and me too! </p>
<p>I really did take it easy, as Bryn strongly suggested for the rest of the morning and the early afternoon, spending lots of time on the computer, while Akane was out of the house, and then sitting on the sofa with a hot pack for the rest of the time. Akane went out and bought eggs, some "instant" hot packs for me for the plane trip, and a Tylenol equivalent too, as the pills that the doctor prescribed for both me and Bryn don't always seem to work for me. </p>
<p>However, Riku's piano lesson is today, and Bryn had suggested earlier in my visit that I go along and see him not only playing (we get to sit in the same room with him), but to see the lovely little park/shrine area where he has his snack beforehand. Bryn didn't think it a good idea for me to do that walk today, though, and actively discouraged me, as it is half again as long as the walk to school. But I don't want to wait until November to meet his teacher and envision his walk there. So, we walked slowly to school, and met Riku, along with lots of children who surrounded us on our way out of the grounds. </p>
<p>It is just a lovely walk to where Riku's piano teacher lives, in amongst the hills behind the school. The road is winding, and the views are just lovely all the way along up to the forested part of the area. When there is time, Akane and Riku usually stop to have his snack on the grounds of a small shrine, but today, since he is now in school longer, we had time for just a quick look, and a few photos too, of course. He snacked on apple slices on the way.</p>
<p>His teacher, Sensei Abe (Ab-eh) is just lovely: soft spoken, gentle, and ever so patient. Bryn and I sat in the small room behind Riku and the teacher at the piano, and of course I took lots of video and a few photos during practice. At the end, she played a "game" with Riku where she played a few notes on a small keyboard, and Riku replicated them on the piano. We were amazed at how well he did! He obviously has a good ear, and he got several thumbs up from her. At the end of the lesson, I asked if I could take a photo of them, then Bryn took one of me with them, and then she got her camera and took a few photos as well! Just a few hours later she had sent them through to us. I liked her very much, and she told Bryn to bring me back another time, but that won't be until late fall. </p>
<p>We stopped to smell some gorgeous yellow roses on the way home, and I took a few photos of the surrounding hills. Much to my surprise, Bryn hailed a cab and I was very happy to not face the half-hour walk home. I was knackered, and happy to be home with my feet up and a hot pack behind my back. I pretty much stayed there the entire evening, and felt much better for it too. </p>
<p>Bryn bathed with the children again tonight, with lots of happy laughter coming from the bath area (music to my soul), and Mirei blew some bubbles at the end of her bath. </p>
<p>I was feeling better enough at the end of the day that I asked if Riku could sleep in with me for my final three nights there. Bryn agreed, and Riku and I were both very happy. After the children were tucked into bed , Akane and Bryn left for dinner out, and I had some computer time. Not much, though, as I was sore, and tired, and headed off to bed before 10 P.M.</p>
