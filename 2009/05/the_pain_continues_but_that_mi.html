								<h2>That Mirei ... aka Florence Nightingale, but Florence with a Wardrobe!</h2>
								<p>I awoke this morning at 1 A.M. to use the bathroom, and it was a half hour of pure agony between getting up and getting back down to my futon on the floor. In between it took at least ten minutes to slide off the futon and get to the bedroom door (about three feet in total!), and then another ten to get up off the floor.Getting to the bathroom was the third, and last, ten minutes of this painful trip. Man! I hurt! </p>
<p>The shade we used for the first time in our room last night is just amazing. The room is full of daylight from 5 A.M. on, and Riku has been awaking anytime from half past five on the last few days, but at 6:45 this morning he was still sleeping soundly. </p>
<p>I managed to get to the doorway, and then called quietly to Bryn (who was in the kitchen) to help  me up, not willing to do this again on my own, unless I had no choice. Gee, I was up and standing within seconds!</p>
<p>He gently woke Riku, with a quiet "good morning", and of course Mirei went bouncing in, full of vim and vigour; Riku wasn't quite ready for that level of morning cheer! He had slept for almost two extra hours, and I am so sorry we didn't know that the window shades were on all the windows in the house, except the sliding doors. They're a protection against typhoons, and almost everyone has them in this area. I love them! </p>
<p>I hobbled into the shower area, and let the hot water pour down my back. My nightie fell onto the floor and got soaked, but there was no way I could reach down to rescue it. Bryn had given me the prescription pain pill first, but I honestly do not think they are working for me. I just felt helpless, and was near tears for the first hour after waking. </p>
<p>Mirei was such a darling. I called her into the bathroom to help me with my underwear and socks! I just could not bend that far, so she squatted down and put them all at floor level, so I could step into them, and of course I could manage once she got them up to about my knees. She was so efficient with the socks ... asked me where the heel should be on her hands, and turned them perfectly, so that when she was facing me the heel was in the right position! And all the while, she kept assuring me "You will be OK, Nana" and "You will get better, Nana." and of course I will, but I want it to be today! </p>
<p>I decided it would be better not to walk Riku to school today, much to my chagrin, as it is only the second day I have missed since arriving five weeks ago. But I had no idea how long it would take us to do that twenty-minute walk the way I was feeling. He went off to school with Akane, waving goodbye from the gate. </p>
<p>I didn't know what to do to get comfortable. Sitting hurt too much, standing did as well, and I certainly couldn't lie down! Every time Mirei looked at my face, she made a comment.. "Are you okay, Nana?", "Let me check your hand; is it getting better? Let me kiss it.", worried still about the very superficial small scrape on that hand(!), and "Oh, it's getting better now!" </p>
<p>What a very sweet little girl she is, running to get me anything I needed at all ... my water bottle, a blanket, "the orange pillow or the green one? The orange one is nice and hot (from the bed buddy) and the green one is nice and cool." All that attention and kisses too. I am one lucky woman! I hope she's around in another thirty years! </p>
<p>I finally made myself a little "nest" on the sofa, with folded duvets, and two pillows, and got some heat behind my lower back with the bed buddy. That felt pretty good, and even more so after I took two of the 222s (acetaminophen with codeine) I bought in Canada, and luckily have with me! I found them tucked into a corner of my kit bag. Mirei suggested "Just relax, Nana." and "Just sit back and close your eyes; you will feel better soon." and I did indeed. We had about two hours of nesting/reading/photo-shooting/playing time on the big wide sofa. Akane kindly cooked up a perfectly fried egg and grainy toast for me, and a big cup of hot chocolate too, all of which I was ready for once the pain had eased.</p>
<p>It will be such fun to see the photos Mirei took of me and of us, as it was quite a long photo shoot! She is just at the stage where she likes to make really silly faces and then checks them out immediately, so she can howl when she does so. What a funny little girl she is. I can't imagine not seeing her for so long, as she changes every single day, and not just her clothes! </p>
<p>Akane brought her computer over to the sofa for me, and while Mirei was upstairs changing clothes, a habit she has cultivated since having access to lots of new clothes in her room right now, I managed to answer emails from friends and family. I dozed off now and then too, much to my surprise, but it shows me how much more relaxed I am! Mirei wandered in and out of the living room, getting up to snuggle with me, and then getting off to tend to her babies, or find another bag to stuff blankets and animals into. She had time for some drawing too, as I found her lying on my futon in the bedroom at one point. </p>
<p>At 1 P.M. Akane and Mirei left the house, with Mirei wearing her new summery black cotton dress with bunnies on it, a black bolero type sweater over it, and sadly reduced to just one tiny pink bunny purse (and not the big pink "packback" and pink cloth bag as well). "I won't be tired! I will carry them myself!" but Mommy won, and off they went for lunch, and a little time away from the house.  </p>
<p>Bryn went off on his new bike to a distant caf√©, and Riku came roaring in the house at 1:50, having walked home on his own again. He declined a snack (they eat lunch and are then dismissed), but told me he would let me know when he's hungry. </p>
<p>He was playing on his own in his room, and I heard some calling out from his window to outside the house.Yuu-kun and another boy were out there, and were inviting him to go to the other boy's house. He is also a grade one student, although also not in Riku's class. I told Riku he needed to find out if the mother was home, and so off they ran. I put on my jacket and walked over to the house, just around the corner, to make sure there was someone home and to make sure she knew about the plan. Riku and I had seen this little boy turn into the driveway for his home back when I was picking him up, so I knew just where to go.The mom was very friendly, and even spoke a little English, so I was able to ask her to send Riku home at 4 P.M. for his piano practice. That gave the three boys almost two hours to play. Fifteen minutes later he was home to grab his Pokemon cards, and ran back over to show to show them his little collection. Just before the deadline he was home, a happy boy. </p>
<p>Akane made okonomiyaki for dinner, with a vegetarian version for me. It was delicious, and the children finished up quickly so they could watch "Doraemon". This character, an ear-less cat, is a Japanese comic book icon, who became even more popular once animated and shown on TV. It's Friday and they were allowed to stay up later tonight for a treat. </p>
<p>Mirei, again like Caillie, has a hard time merely sitting and watching anything for too long on the tv, so in between what caught her attention. Mirei and Bryn shared some silly time together. She was sitting on her Dad's lap, taking turns with him imitating her as she posed, fingers to face, and head cocked in one direction or another, and then she imitating her daddy. I took three or four sets of photos in all, which I will get up in an album once I am back home. Soooo cute! Then it was the usual bedtime routine, a little more rushed than usual as it was later than normal.</p>
<p>I had decided to sleep on the sofa tonight, after reading online that the worst thing one could do for stretched tendons and/or pulled muscles was to bend at all, and certainly not to be getting up and down from a floor. So a decision was made to have Riku sleep in his own bed on his own. He likes snuggling with me, and having a warm body in his bed at night, as he is used to it, but he was such a good sport about this. Mirei would be in with her parents as usual. A little bribe helped too; he was promised a trip to the toy store with his dad tomorrow afternoon, if he made it through the night without calling out. </p>
<p>We read the second last chapter of our book in his bed ("We're almost there, Nana!"), and I turned off the light to snuggle with him for a bit, and woke up two hours later! Egad! Getting out of Riku's low bed is not easy either, especially when my back has tightened up with lying there.  </p>
<p>Earlier in the day, I had a "hit" on my Ancestry tree about my mom's paternal grandfather and had been looking forward to answering the gal who wrote to me, and putting in the new (for us) information. But those two hours of sleep did away with that plan! I did manage to write to her, but was anxious to get to bed.</p>
<p>Bryn helped me set up the sofa with two duvets and pillows, and my little nighttime nest on the sofa looked very inviting by the time I was ready to tuck in. </p>
