								<h2>A Drizzly, Grey Day, and My Last in Kyoto for Many Moons</h2>
								<p>Riku slept in until 6:45 A.M. today, waking when he heard Mirei running about upstairs. It was drizzly and grey when we opened our eyes, and it would have been very easy to roll over and go back to sleep ... if rolling over were easy right now, and if there weren't two happy sunny children eager to get on with the day. </p>
<p>They rediscovered a "camping" kit and had such fun playing up in their room together after breakfast. Mirei was very fond of the lantern that really lights up, and was delighted that my room was so dark with the metal shades still pulled across. Riku liked the (plastic) "Swiss Army" knife, and Mirei used it to "clean" my fingernails! </p>
<p>I had hoped to make oatmeal cookies with the children today, something we had planned to do just before my fall, but knew I wouldn't be up for the normally fun activity.They weren't aware that I had been hoping to do this, so I sat on the sofa while they played happily around me. </p>
<p>Mirei and I went for a forty-minute walk in the late morning, while Riku did his piano practice. Mirei insisted on taking her umbrella, even though it was barely misting at that stage, but I was without a hood on my jacket and was very happy to carry it for her when the rain came down more seriously! She had on one of her favourite raincoats, with flowers on it, so we both stayed dry. Mirei wanted to walk to the "new" playground to see if Yui-kun, the little boy she played with the first time we went, was there, but of course no one was on this rainy day. We were happy to wander, though, and did so, slowly up and down the blocks, checking to see if her "snowman" lady was in her window. No such luck, and Mirei decided she was "probably having a nap." </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn were having a new Internet connection installed this morning, so Bryn was without his computer for a few hours, with some problem that eventually got fixed up. However, that put him behind in some work he needed to do, and it meant that none of us had computer access for a few hours today.</p>
<p>I put the time to good use, and packed up all my belongings from the one shelf in "my" room. I was sure I was going to need to pack up a big box, as I am taking things back to SF with me that Akane and Bryn don't want any longer, but luckily it all fit into the two bags I have with me. I want to carry only one small bag onto the plane, with my book, ticket, and a bit of food.  </p>
<p>Later in the day, Riku drew a second picture for Skylar, as the first one he drew for her — of his house — somehow disappeared. And, when he had that all set to go, the photo of him with Skylar had disappeared as well! Mirei was beside him drawing too, while I sat on the sofa watching and listening to all the exchanges going on. </p>
<p>Later, the photo fell out of one of Mirei's many many bags that she likes to carry all over the house, stuffed with the things she considers essential to her happiness. She looks like an overloaded workhorse, albeit a very cute one! She reminds me so much of Caillie when she does this: Caillie still has bags and bags of things she needs going from her mom's to her dad's, driving both of them wild. Ah well, this too shall pass. </p>
<p>The children started watching an Ultraman show, but Mirei loses interest in TV very quickly, as did her daddy at the same age, so went back to her bags, hauling them here and there, as she came upon anything newish. She and Akane went off together to the grocery store as well, so she had two walks in the rain today. </p>
<p>I snuggled up beside Riku on the sofa to keep him company, as he loves someone to watch anything at all with him, but I kept dozing off and snoring! I would tell him I was watching every minute of it, and that my body was just making weird noises, but he didn't buy that for a minute! We all had a nice fruit snack on the sofa too, something not usually allowed. Shhhhh. "Mum's the word," as Mirei would say. </p>
<p>Akane ordered two plain pizzas in for dinner, a first this trip, and had bought tomatoes and fresh basil to add to them if we chose. It was good, but not Amici's. Bryn showered both the children together tonight, for a treat, and by 6:45 they were both flossed, brushed, and ready for story times. Riku and I read a few pages of "I Found a Dead Bird", which always leads to lots of interesting discussions once the light is out. </p>
<p>I had some time on the computer once Riku was asleep, but was too sore and tired to concentrate on emails or blogging, so did a few family tree hits instead. Bed at 11 P.M., my last night here for too long a time. </p>
