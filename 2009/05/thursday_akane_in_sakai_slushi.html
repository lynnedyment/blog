								<h2>Thursday ... "Hello"s,  Some Would-Be Spying, and Slushies</h2>
								<p>I felt great this morning! No trouble at all getting up from my bed on the floor, and was in the shower at 6 A.M., with a load of laundry started, and the children's fruit on the table when they came downstairs. Breakfast for the children was relaxed and easy; they ate the fruit right away, Riku polished off his egg and toast, had a fifteen minute break ... drew, and then had porridge, did his morning routine, and we were out the door at 8 A.M. again. Mirei was a little slower today eating her breakfast, and had trouble sitting at the table for some reason. She has an extra fifteen or twenty minutes before she heads out, though, so that helps. </p>
<p>After all the children yesterday stopping to say "hello" and "good morning" to me in English, I decided to take some photos of a few of then today. It was fun, and most of the children are more than happy to pose for me, with big smiles and their peace signs. On the way home I stopped to take some photos of the heron, and hope at least one of them turns out for me. </p>
<p>Akane went off to Sakai to meet with her mom and run some errands, so Bryn and I were on our own with the children after school. After breakfast, I hung up the laundry â€” lovely breezes all day today, and then I caught up on some emails and did some blogging. </p>
<p>Riku has been coming home on his own for quite a few days now, and I thought it would be fun to "spy" on him, and get some photos when he was unaware of my presence. So, I headed out the door at 2:30 today, kept out of sight once I spotted the children walking toward the bridge, and hid behind a drink machine. And along came one older group of children, then a group of younger children with a few older students, but no Riku! An older fellow spotted me hiding, and by way of gestures, I was able to let him know what I was doing hiding away with a camera at the ready! He has seen Riku and me walking home before. Nice to know that someone is paying attention to slightly irregular behaviour!</p>
<p>By then I had decided that Riku must have gone a different way, and so I started walking up toward the house. I got all the way home (by this time it was 2:55 and they he is always home before this)  but he wasn't here. I was a little concerned, of course, and called up to Bryn, who headed immediately out on his bike. </p>
<p>I thought perhaps he had gone to one of the two boys' homes he knows of in the neighbourhood, without asking permission, but was still worried. I headed right back out too, and about three blocks away, around the corner he came, with Bryn right there with him, and about six older boys! </p>
<p>It turned out they had a late dismissal today, as some of the older children in the school were in the classrooms with the younger ones, while the teacher and the students explained some of the dangers of walking home and how to avoid them. Apparently there is an effort made in some of the schools to involve the older students in the care of the younger ones. They were being very friendly with Riku, and all of them called out goodbye to him as we walked along with him home. What a great idea! Now he knows he can call on them if he needs some help along the way. </p>
<p>Yesterday I had Riku freeze apple juice in a cup in the freezer and he liked it so much that I did one for him again today. He was just delighted with it; such an easy way to make him smile. Riku played with Lego in his room for the longest time, so I got the laundry in, folded, and put away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Riku started a letter to Skylar, "the" girl in his classroom in SF, who sent him a framed photo of herself. Riku has a photo of the two of them to send off to her, as well as a picture he drew for her of his house. He did a great job on the accompanying letter, composing it himself, while I spelled out any words he was unsure of. His letter started off on a very positive note "Dear Skylar, Japan is beautiful."</p>
<p>While he did this, I was in the kitchen preparing a Spanish potato omelet for our dinner. It was a staple in our house from the time Kelly and Bryn were children, and Riku and Mirei have had it a few times as well. It is fairly fast, easy, and nutritious, and can vary each time too. Tonight's version had spinach and grated carrot in it, as well as the usual garlic, onions, potatoes, eggs, and cheese ... this time mozzarella, and not the traditional cheddar. Riku just wolfed it down, eating twice as much as I thought he would! Dinner was on the table at 5:30, and by 6 o'clock the dishes were done, and Riku did his spelling with Bryn, before Bryn tubbed both children. The children had lots of free time after this, and played their favourite "cat" game.</p>
<p>Mirei had done her "homework" too, printing both "Mirei" and "Nana" so well; I love how she just loves to do this, and does it already without asking what letter is next.  </p>
<p>Akane arrived home at 6:30, Riku did his two minutes worth of homework, and then his piano practice; he was playing beautifully and I did some taping. While he played, Mirei and I sat on the sofa while she combed my hair, and I combed hers. We read a story too, and so the evening ended. </p>
<p>My hips and back were very sore from the too-long standing in the kitchen. This meant it was particularly hard to settle in with Riku, who also seemed to have trouble falling asleep tonight. Getting up from his low bed was not fun tonight either! I spent most of the evening going through magazines, with a nice hot pack on my back, and making some blog notes. </p>
