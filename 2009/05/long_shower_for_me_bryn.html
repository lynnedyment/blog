								<h2>Visitors for the Children, a Walk Along the River, and a Quiet Evening Home Alone</h2>
								<p>It's "Golden Week", a national holiday here so Riku has the next three days off school. It was such a treat to have both children join me in bed for cuddles this morning, three days in a row. Bryn told me not long after we finally emerged from my room, that Akane's mother and sister would be visiting today, arriving some time mid-morning. </p>
<p>While they got breakfast going for the children, I took a really long shower and then soaked in the tub for a while, just relaxing. It's the first time I have tubbed this trip, being a shower kind of gal, but it was nice to sink down in that big stainless steel tub. </p>
<p>Knowing the day was going to be busy, Riku got his reading and spelling out of the way early today, and Mirei and I passed some time in my room, looking at a funny video her cousin Bryn had made, and then of course we went on to watch lots of others of all the children after that. </p>
<p>Ayako and Mrs. Goda arrived about 10:15, about ten minutes after Riku's piano practice had started. There was lots of excitement, as their grandmother had arrived with lots of food treats, which both children wanted to sample right away, and some small gifts for them as well. I said hello and then left them to have some time together. Mirei was happy to have their full attention while Riku finished playing, and then he too was busy visiting, and eating. </p>
<p>I took the time to myself to read quietly in my room. Propped up with two pillows on my futon on the floor, windows open to a nice breeze, I was nice and cozy and enjoyed getting something done too. At 11:30, they all headed out for lunch and shopping, so at noon I made Bryn and me a hot lunch of pasta with fresh tomatoes, cheese, and some carrot sticks. Bryn went right back to work and I spent two plus hours on the computer emailing and blogging. </p>
<p>By then I was ready to stretch my legs, so left the house at 3:30, walked down to the river and along that lovely path for a long time. There were lots of people out, couples walking, children in the little play areas, joggers, elderly men and women well covered in hats and long sleeves, and cyclists. There were lots of benches scattered about, and I sat to read for a bit, although really spent more time watching all the action. </p>
<p>As I was sitting, I was attempting to open a new bottle of water I bought at the 7/11 on the way down. I have the worst times with those lids for some reason, and a man walking by happened to notice me struggling with it. He came over to offer help, which I gladly accepted, and then we "chatted" for about close to an hour or more. </p>
<p>This was such an interesting encounter, as of course I speak about five words of Japanese (and don't always get those words pronounced correctly!), but it was perhaps three more words than this fellow knew in English. Well, not quite but more of that later. Despite the lack of a common language, we did manage to communicate over the course of that time, that I was born in England, raised in Canada, flew to Osaka from San Francisco, and then took a train to Kyoto. And yes, I was on my own, visiting my son (not sure this was understood), and had two young grandchildren. He was born and raised here in Kyoto, doesn't have a passport, has never left Japan, and has four grandchildren. </p>
<p>I believe he was attempting to ask me out, as he asked if I liked sushi. Just try explaining to someone in another language that one doesn't eat meat (and yes, I know that not all sushi is meat or fish related, but I assumed in his case it was what he meant). And yes, embarrassingly, as Bryn later told me it was, I moo-ed and baa-ed and even tried to get some young teen students there to help us out. So, no word for "no meat" but I said "no" to "steak?" with sawing motion, "yes" to spaghetti, "yes" to wine, and another "yes" to ice cream. But it was obvious we had said all there was to be said, and so it was "sayonara" after that. It was a very pleasant encounter and I spoke with another set of three young students, all thirteen, and happy to practice their English with me. </p>
<p>I was back home before Akane, Ayako, and the children, as they had dropped Mrs. Goda off at the train station for her trip back to Osaka, and then fed the children dinner. They didn't arrive home until almost 7 o'clock so it was a short evening at home for them: baths, dessert, and bed late at 8:15. Both asleep very quickly after such a busy day out and about for all those hours. And they came home with a flat screen TV (for the tatami room when Mrs. Goda visits), and a bigger one for the living room on order, gifts from Mrs. Goda. </p>
<p>Once the children were asleep, Akane, Ayako, and Bryn went out for dinner. I had some computer time. a bonus catch-up day for me today, and they were back at 10. Akane and Ayako went off for a walk, and I headed off to bed at 10:30 tonight, tired after a long day, and ready for tomorrow! </p>
