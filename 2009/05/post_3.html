								<h2>A Surprise Invitation</h2>
								<p>Doug had picked Susan, Kevin, and the children up at the airport at 11:20 this morning, back from their ten-day visit to Toronto and further afield, and into Quebec too. I was home taking it very easy, spending some time on the computer, and reading during my frequent breaks from sitting here. </p>
<p>Much to our delight, we had a phone call from Susan about 1:30, wondering if we would like to join them for a very early supper ... sort of "dunch", I guess. I was ready to get out of the house for a break, and ready to hear about their trip and see the children, so the answer of course was a resounding "We'd love to!" </p>
<p>I got a little burst of energy and made a pan of brownies (with some chopped dried cranberries), to take with us. We were at the door at 3 P.M. on the nose, and heard Amelia calling out "Hi Nana! Hi Grandpa" from the living room, and Finn was leaning over the gate at the top of the stairs calling to us exuberantly as well. He was all smiles, and followed Doug into the kitchen, while I headed for the living room to see Amelia. I got a nice gentle hug, and she asked how I was feeling now. I snuggled next to her and watched a bit of her movie with her, and then left to say hello to Susan and Finn. </p>
<p>We visited and caught up on our news, while Finn and Doug sat together in the bean bag chair in the living room, "reading" aka "looking to see if there are any photos in the adult books from the bookcase in that room." Not many, as it turned out, but the hunt was fun, I gather, as they were in there and quiet for the longest time! </p>
<p>Dunch time! We sat at their lovely new big table to a choice of three Amici's pizzas, freshly delivered. Yum! Amelia urged me to try the pesto, her new favourite, and Finn was helping himself to one of each, after taste-testing them first. We had salad, I ate lots of pizza(!), chatted away, and then finished up with cheesecake and/or the brownies, and tea. Yummy, every bite of it. </p>
<p>Amelia had catch-up homework to do, finishing up the daily journal she was to keep while on holiday. She had done a creative job on many of the pages with dried leaves, admission passes to various museums in Toronto, details of her day at Opa's 80th birthday party, visiting with relatives, swimming at Uncle Peter's pool and four days at his cottage near Tremblant, Quebec. Amelia was tired though, and had been sick at the hotel this morning and again on the plane, so I felt sorry for her as she dragged on, trying to finish up, when all she wanted to do was relax and talk with us. </p>
<p>Kevin bathed Finn; I cleared the table, and then sat down with another cup of tea, while Amelia got those last two sentences done up. We left as she was about to pop in the tub, and I heard later that both children were asleep at 7 P.M. </p>
<p>It's lovely to have them home, and so good to have little ones in my life again. </p>
