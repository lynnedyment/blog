								<h2>Cabbages and Flower Wreaths, and Acquaintances Old and New</h2>
								<p>What a lovely day this was! The sun was shining, the air was warm, and there was a slight breeze. Riku and I left for school five minutes earlier than usual, at 8 A.M., and so I had time to stop to take a photo of the very friendly neighbour on the next block who never fails to say good morning to us, with a big smile, and a slight bow. And there are always an extra few words for Riku as well. </p>
<p>Coming home, I decided to take a new street, and passed by one of the many commercial gardens in this area. I saw a man cutting lovely big cabbages, and stopped to have a look at them, and at the quickly-filling pea pods too. We had exchanged greetings and I walked on, but he stopped me with a "one moment" in English. He proceeded to cut a lovely big cabbage for me! I was so very pleased and thanked him so much, and asked if I could take his photo. He was a little shy about it, but nodded yes. I do like to have these memories of the friendly people I meet! </p>
<p>Akane went to Osaka/Sakai on her own today, via bus, train, train, subway, and bus I believe. Mirei and I set off at 10:30 to walk to the grocery store for those groceries we tried to get yesterday, but she had spotted what we thought might be a playground on the way home from that trip. I am so glad she had mentioned it, as we stopped by there first and met a "Baba" and her three-year-old grandson there. He and Mirei played so well together, and the grandmother was fun too, playing "baseball" with them both, and then weaving a lovely head wreath of blossoms for Mirei. The children picked the flowers for them, and followed each other around the big field exploring. We hope to meet up again tomorrow. </p>
<p>And once again today, we passed another "regular" on our walks, an older woman who is blind in one eye. It's permanently closed, and as we stopped to chat with her a bit as she was resting against a wall, Mirei asked her lots of questions. but all in Japanese so I have no idea what they said to each other. </p>
<p>We continued on, bought our groceries, and a tired little girl after an hour and a half of physical activity unpacked the groceries from her tiny bag, looking every bit the little housewife. </p>
<p>Our afternoon was busy with various activities, and Mirei snacked, and snacked, and snacked. She must be going through a growth spurt, as the calories going into this little body are huge! We went out to see if we could see Riku coming, waited a few minutes, and were greeted with his big smile. They had a snack together, then played for a while, before Riku ran over to invite Yuu-kun to play for an hour. </p>
<p>I put together a very quick dinner for the children, from various bits and pieces in the fridge, and after their tub Riku especially ate so much and so well. The usual reading/spelling followed, and Riku drew a picture of this house for Skylar, his "special" friend at Starr King in San Francisco. </p>
<p>Akane arrived home in time to say goodnight to Riku, although Mirei was fast asleep by then! Her daddy tucked a very tired little girl in at 7:15. </p>
<p>That's it folks!</p>
