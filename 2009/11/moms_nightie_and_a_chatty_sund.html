								<h2>Mom's Nightie, and a Chatty Sunday</h2>
								<p>I have been chilly at night since Doug left, and had switched on Friday night to a long sleeveless nightie, much warmer than my usual short spaghetti-strap one. I still woke a few times that night, burrowing in deeper to keep and stay warm. So, last night I pulled out the heavy artillery, a long full flannel nightie with sleeves, one that Kelly had made for my mom over fifteen years ago. Mom had been complaining about not being warm enough, and Kelly made two of the same pattern for her. Mom loved them so much; they are full enough that you can pull your legs and feet right up into them, they don't bind anywhere, and you can even twirl like a ballerina in them, and check out how little and feminine one looks in it while doing so. I had <strong>such</strong> a good sleep, right through until 8:20! </p>
<p>I basically puttered about again today. I like these days of mine a lot; I am cooking simple yummy meals for myself. For breakfast today I had a bowl of oatmeal with nuts and seeds, and have been sauteeing spinach, serving it over brown rice with veggies, eating big salads, a daily fruit bowl with yogurt, and nibbling healthy things during the day. They're all quick and easy and perfect for me. </p>
<p>I connected with lots of family today and it was grand. Caillie called on the phone, Bryn Skyped with me, and I got to talk with Mirei for a long time, and with Riku long enough for him to show me his latest transformer, a dark "bad" guy. Mirei showed me a book that she says was a little scary (skulls), holding it up carefully so I could see it, and turning over each page carefully so I didn't miss any of it. Doug called through on Skype too, mostly to check which of Gail's two microphones worked best, but Gail and I had a few minutes to talk too. My great-niece Ashleigh sent a message on IM and so I chatted first with her and then her little sister Felicia, who added me as a friend on Facebook. And, speaking of Facebook, I also had a message when I awoke from a second cousin in Liverpool, a brand new connection! And last but not least, Uncle Frank rang through a half hour before his dinner time, and we chatted and then reconnected again three hours later and talked for close to two hours! </p>
<p>That was it ... laundry, lots of paper sorting, time with my feet up going through several more magazines, but not much emailing, as I spent a lot of time on family tree in between jobs, trying to clear away some of that paper work! All in all, a productive day, although I realized as soon as it got dark, that I hadn't been out for my walk! It just disappeared in a flurry of chats today! I will make up for it tomorrow for certain. </p>
<p>I snapped a few photos of Riku and Mirei and of her with her dad, but they shall have to wait to get posted until Doug gets home. </p>
