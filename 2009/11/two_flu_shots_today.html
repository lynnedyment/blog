								<h2>Two Flu Shots, and a Skype Chat with Riku</h2>
								<p>Doug and I were out the door at 7:30 this morning and pleased to find the parking at the new offices for the doctor much easier than we expected it to be. Doug saw a nurse-practitioner for this visit, as the ER doctors wanted him to have a baseline visit, so he could be followed from this point on. His blood pressure is up but he knows he is worried about how long this inner ear problem is going to last, and of course there is no way to find out. He does have an appointment with an ear/nose/throat specialist next Monday, though, and perhaps he might have some insight into what is going on. </p>
<p>We stopped in at Rainbow Groceries, the first time we have been out and wandering around since last Friday, and we stopped in at the post office too, buying stamps for the Christmas cards I have been writing, a few at a time throughout the day. </p>
<p>Since I hope to be back working as a doula at SFGH before too long, I have to have both flu shots. They have a clinic set up three days a week and so this afternoon I went off to get them. I thought it would just be the H1N1 but they had both that and the seasonal shot available, and I was happy to get them over with at the same time. It was a gorgeous warm day again and it was nice to be out for a little walk in the sun. </p>
<p>I got lots of little jobs done in the house today, cleared away lots of emails, sat and went through a few magazines (I have stacks of them!), and Doug sat and signed Christmas cards with me. I had been doing them on my own, as he hasn't felt up to any close work, so I think this is a good sign of some small improvement. </p>
<p>Bryn and I were chatting on IM this evening; they are all off to Sakai tomorrow after Mirei's first piano lesson (!) (I can't wait to hear how this goes), Mirei is back in school and enjoying it, and is also enjoying spending time with Mark. Bryn is happy to have Mark there, getting to spend some time with him and getting to know the children better too. </p>
<p>I got to talk to Riku after he got home from school. How I love seeing Riku's big smile! He told me how he had rescued a caterpillar recently; the other day it was a big slug that he moved off the road, and I told him about Auntie Candy and Uncle Rick rescuing a cat, who was walking across a busy road with a potato chip bag over its head! Riku also showed me the birthday card that Auntie Gail and Uncle Tom sent to him and read it to me as well. I snapped lots of photos of him, including one of him reading that card to me, and now have the hard task of deciding which ones to keep. They are all on Doug's computer and I am sure I won't be able to keep them all! How lucky I am to be living in this time; I often think of how different my Nana Lee's life in Liverpool would have been, all those years ago, when her grandchildren were so young, and living so far away.  </p>
