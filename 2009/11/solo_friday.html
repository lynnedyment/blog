								<h2>Solo Friday</h2>
								<p>I woke far too early this morning, at 5:30, but came downstairs, turned on the heat, and crawled back into bed to read while the house warmed up. It was cold again this morning... 62F, but it seems much colder than that without Doug's warm back beside me. I hoped I might fall asleep, though, and sure enough I did, and woke much more ready for my day at 7:45. </p>
<p>The day was dark and overcast, and by the time I ate my late breakfast it was really dark and the rain had pouring down, the kind of rain that makes a lot of noise on the glass ceiling in the eating area when it starts. I loved it ... the sound of it, the darkness ... except for the bright glistening trees in the garden soaking it all up! I always feel very productive on days like this, and so I was today, getting through lots of random odd jobs.</p>
<p>I also curled up in the living room and ate my lunch, the last half of the delicious sandwich that Doug was to have taken to eat on the plane yesterday. It was sliced marinated tofu, on a bed of greens, topped with sun-dried tomatoes, all on a lovely gently crusted roll. That, and a cup of hot tea, was the perfect meal for me, as I got through two more magazines from my once-overflowing basket. </p>
<p>At 3 P.M. I went out for my walk, as I had promised Kelly I would. Today I decided not to look at my watch until I was close to home, so once again walked quickly to and around the children's playground off Potrero Avenue, said hello in reply to the one child on the climbing structure, the only child in the entire play area today(!), and I stopped to take a couple of photos of some skateboarders nearby at the skateboard circle. How Bryant would enjoy going there in March, so I sure hope the visit happens. </p>
<p>I walked along Potrero Avenue, past the hospital, walking up the hill and behind it, before heading once more up the hill towards Riku's old school, then down those 132 steps. I checked my watch and was happy to see that I had indeed been out for the requisite forty-five minutes! </p>
<p>Lots of emails answered, although just as many came in too, and I worked on some photos, spent a little time on the family tree, slotting in some information that came in from a cousin in England this morning, and went through another two magazines after dinner, with my second cup of tea of the day. </p>
<p>As I go through these magazines, my list of books grows ever-longer! I remember saying once, many years ago, that a perfect trip for me would be a cruise around the world on a very slow moving ship, with a steamer trunk loaded with all the books it could hold from my book list ... and that dream still holds. </p>
