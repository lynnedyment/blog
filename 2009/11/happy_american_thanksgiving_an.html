								<h2>Happy (American) Thanksgiving ... and Doug Arrives Home!</h2>
								<p>I woke at 5 this morning and had trouble nodding off again, so turned the light on and read for an hour, putting my very exciting book, "Searching for Nouf", down just one chapter before the end! However, I knew I needed the extra sleep and was very happy to awaken at 7:45! </p>
<p>I hurried downstairs to turn the heat on, and shower, as I thought Amelia might be coming over for a visit with me this morning. Finn will be busy with his Spanish sitter as is usual on a Thursday, and I knew Kevin and Susan would be busy making their big Thanksgiving dinner. However, no call came and I spent lots of time with my siblings exchanging funny childhood memories via email. </p>
<p>I wrapped some gifts this morning and got one lot ready for mailing tomorrow, so now my counter looks that much tidier. I answered emails, one to a dear friend, Carol, whose mother passed away yesterday; her mom had a serious stroke two days ago but this was still unexpected so soon.</p>
<p>I picked Doug up at the airport at 3 P.M. and we went to Safeway for some produce before heading home. I had decided this morning that we would have a Thanksgiving dinner tonight.I had a delicious "Celebration Roast" in the freezer, a vegetarian entree we both had tried previously and liked a lot, but I needed bread for stuffing, and a turnip, for our feast. </p>
<p>Back at home, I got busy making Mom's stuffing, chatting with Doug, and catching up on all our news. This was always a special day for Uncle Frank, who is an American, so I called him and was happy to hear that By' and Neal were both in visiting with him. They were ready to leave, though, so we hung up for their goodbyes, and then Uncle Frank called me back. Glenn called in the two or three minutes between our calls, so it was good to hear that lots of people were thinking about him today. </p>
<p>While I peeled, chopped, sauteed, grated, and stirred, Uncle Frank and I chatted about all sorts of things ... poetry, his table-mates at the retirement home, photos of the children I had sent on, the video of Riku skateboarding, his physical therapist and fitness routine — he's so happy with them both — and relatives in England. We were on the phone for well over an hour and when we said goodbye dinner was ready to go on the table! </p>
<p>Doug was delighted, as he hadn't expected a special dinner at all. This is not a typical dinner for us at all, and Doug always comments on these "real" dinners as he says ... meaning the kind we grew up with ... an entree (the sage flavoured "roast"), at least extra two veggies (Mom's traditional carrots and turnips mashed together with butter), plus mashed potatoes (I now use a combination of sweet and white), cranberry sauce, and gravy. </p>
<p>I realized once we got home that I had forgotten to buy the Brussel sprouts, so may pick those up tomorrow and serve it when we have hot "turkey" sandwiches for tomorrow's dinner. It was very very tasty! </p>
<p>Bryn sent me a voice recording tonight from his IPhone, another lovely surprise after receiving his video of Riku last night. He had just taken Riku to his piano lesson on his bike; they were a bit rushed, it is a longish way from their home, some of it uphill, and it was gorgeous with a hot sun shining (65ºF). Bryn was hot and tired when they arrived and so decided to stay outside while Riku had his lesson. He tested his newly discovered recording abilities and taped a chatty little message to me;  I could hear birds singing in the background! Not only did I hear Bryn's voice very clearly, but I get to keep the recording, as I do the video of Riku, and play them whenever I like. Can't wait to get more of these and with Riku and Mirei's voices too! Not too much later a lovely photo of Riku came in, surrounded by beautiful trees in autumn colours, taken on their way home for the lesson. </p>
<p>Doug processed some blog photos for me from the last few days, but was feeling quite disoriented and his vision was not right. He did tell me on the way home today that he was not noticing any changes at all, despite time and the exercises he has been doing, so is even more discouraged right now. I hope tomorrow is better for him. </p>
<p>(I just looked at the photo of my dinner, and yup, there is a place there for those missing Brussels sprouts! I shall have to take another shot of dinner tomorrow night!) </p>
<p>I'm off to finish that last chapter, and then I get to choose a new book! </p>
