								<h2>The Week Flew By!</h2>
								<p>Unlike the past few days, the weather today was overcast from the time we woke, until we went to bed. There were periods of rain, too, and the tiniest ray of sunshine burst through at one point. I walked to the mailbox in a light drizzle and enjoyed the fine mist there and back. It was mild too, much more so than I thought it would be, as the house stayed cool all day. </p>
<p>I went into the family tree today to enter some new information from Doug's cousin, Bob, who has been filling me in on some family members. Now that I know I'm not going to Japan on Monday after all, I slacked off and enjoyed this time working on the Ancestry tree. I went for months without having more than an hour here and there, and so it was fun to be working away at it again. </p>
<p>Bryn and family and Mark were on their way to Sakai tonight, right after Mirei's first piano lesson. I can't wait to hear how it went, but I did get a photo from Bryn of Riku at his lesson. I like his teacher so much, and think this photo shows just how compatible these two are ... I thought they were a perfect fit when I saw them together in May. Riku is looking very grown-up to us lately! </p>
<p>I had a very long chat with Uncle Frank tonight; I sat down to write him and decided I would much rather hear his voice. I made myself a cup of tea, and sat on the sofa hearing all his latest news. He has a new male therapist and is happy to be back working at his exercises again. He filled me in on a few people I got to know when I was there in September, and I told him that I had a nice letter in from Neal today. Neal drops in to see him almost weekly, and UF got to meet Nea's aide, a young woman named Laura, who is newly graduated and still full of optimism and good spirits. UF enjoyed her company as much as Neal did. </p>
<p>Doug and I went up to watch a recorded show; I'm getting close to my stockpile of old Oprah's and am enjoying watching them with Doug in the evenings, just for a break together. </p>
<p>It's cold enough at night now that I am happy to head up with two of my "bed buddies"; how I love having my cold feet all warmed up within seconds. Doug pointed out a cartoon this morning in the paper that he felt was drawn just for me ... it showed a group of folks in hell, in a fiery inferno, and one gal off to the right, wrapped in a sweater saying "Don't you find it a bit chilly here?" Yup, that's me! </p>
