								<h2>A Relaxing Evening with Barbara Kingsolver, after a Busy Day at Home</h2>
								<p>I spent the day at home, continuing to putter about, getting things done. I ordered a few books online for the children for Christmas, with a long list on hand and lots of help from Doug. I don't enjoy ordering over the Internet but Doug does it so often that it's much faster to sit beside him and let him do his thing. </p>
<p>Emails are slowly but surely being answered, although it's funny how it all works. I send off three and get two back, send off four and two come up. At the end of one day, after feeling I had been answering emails the entire time, I went to bed with exactly the same number in that inbox and I had when my day began! </p>
<p>Today I heard from two far-flung friends/relatives with lots of news, and I answered immediately. I would so much rather get caught up this way then try to do it in the Christmas cards, so must plug away at it. </p>
<p>One of the many gifts I received from Susan and Kevin was a pair of tickets to see Barbara Kingsolver, one of my favourite authors. I was given her most current book at the time too, the non-fiction "Animal,Vegetable, Miracle".  </p>
<p>Her books are always compelling stories, detailed, and guaranteed good reads, just my cup of tea. I was to have missed it, as I was booked for Japan, but there are good sides to everything, and being able to see and hear Barbara Kingsolver tonight was proof of that. </p>
<p>Doug and I enjoyed this evening so much! I was tired, but the minute she started talking I was alert and interested. Barbara Kingsolver is such a warm and vibrant person; she was so comfortable talking about why and how she writes what she does, and is so obviously a people-person. Doug has not read any of her books but he is keen to get her newest, "The Lacuna" from the library. Turns out lots of other folks are too, as there is a waiting list of 66 people, so he may be reading it in the New Year. </p>
<p>It was a very relaxing way to end my evening, as was my small glass of cherry berry hard cider from Nanaimo. </p>
