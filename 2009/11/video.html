								<h2>Dickens Christmas Faire</h2>
								<p>Susan kindly gave us two free tickets to the annual "Dickens Christmas Faire", held in the Cow Palace in San Francisco. This was a wonderful start to the Christmas season. </p>
<p>Doug and I have been twice before several years ago, and took Riku with us both times. The first year there was a wonderful display of wooden parts for castle building and Riku had a great time. He also chose a long glass beaded ornament to hang on the Christmas tree. The second time we went he quite enjoyed listening to the rousing music and watching the dancers on stage. They had a wonderful Victorian Santa there too, who was of course a huge hit, especially since he was a really gentle, soft-spoken Santa. </p>
<p>This huge venue is done up as Victorian streets, complete with shops, cafes where you can buy scones and tea, restaurants for fish and chips, and pubs and bars for cider and beer, etc. The very best part of all are the 3000 actors (though not all there at the same time) walking around in period clothing, keeping in character with their various British accents, from the highbrow to the scruffiest accent imaginable. If you are walking by and hear a couple talking they are doing so in their accents, discussing matters of the "day" way back when. We stopped to watch a foursome of young people playing a game; it was a delight to listen to them talk in their chosen dialects, and as we approached one of the gals called out to us "e's cheatin' Ma'm, 'e is!" and the other chorused in to second it. It's just the most fun! </p>
<p>Because we were on our own, we sat and watched a two-hour range of entertainment at "Big Sal's" saloon. There was singing, dancing, and bawdy plays, and we got to join in and sing along too at times. The entire cast was obviously having a grand ol' time, as were we. We were there for over three hours; there wasn't much of a crowd when we arrived later in the day on the first weekend, and so the actors far outnumbered us this time. </p>
<p>Later that evening Bryn sent <a href="http://bit.ly/4SuPXj"><u>a lovely video of the children</u></a> tossing rocks into a stream at the back of a caf√© they had been to. It was Sunday afternoon for them, and such a treat for me to see them and hear their voices at the end of my day. </p>
