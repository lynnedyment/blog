								<h2>A Perfectly Lovely Day</h2>
								<p>I made myself some scrambled eggs for breakfast today, cooked just the way I like them and served with two slices of "bacon". A big mug of hot chocolate finished it off while I read the paper. </p>
<p>Caillie rang; she was snuggled up in bed at her Dad's, with a sore eye. She had knocked it on a desk at school yesterday and this morning it was infected and goopy and closed shut. However, she was in good spirits and we chatted for over forty-five minutes about this and that. She now has a pair of jeans, her first ever! I'm hoping to see a photo of her in them, but if she doesn't get around to it, I will be seeing her in less than a month. The time is flying by, of course!</p>
<p>Susan called this morning to see if I would like to join them at Union Square downtown while they ice-skated with the children. Actually, she fully intended to get me on skates too! I had plans to get out to a bookstore sale early, and after she told me her intentions I was very glad I had an excuse not to go! I tried many many times when I was a child, and once as an adult to skate, but my fear of falling gets in the way every time. Whew! </p>
<p>I went off to the West Portal neighbourhood and spent two hours there, really puttering about the bookstore and choosing books for the children with the help of a very knowledgable staff member, who seems to have read every children's book they stock! I only bought four books, but came home with a long list of possibilities for gifts down the road. There is a wonderful toy store in the neighbourhood too, so I ambled around there for a bit, just for fun, and then poked in and out of several other stores there as well. I tried to talk myself into a bun or cookie or something at the bakery but none of it appealed to me at all. I had deliberately parked a few blocks away from the main street so I could get my walk in this way today. </p>
<p>From there I drove to Noe Valley. For many years I was up in that neighbourhood at least once a week. There are many wonderful little cafes and restaurants, oodles of interesting shops, and a nice ambience too, with lots of couples, family groups with their dogs in tow, and healthy looking seniors bustling about. But over the past few years many stores had closed and whenever I did get there for my hair cuts, it just felt sad and neglected. </p>
<p>I knew a big "natural" food store had gone in there, and was very surprised to see a few less empty shops. It was fun seeing the Christmas decorations up in many of them, along with lots of things to think about buying if one had the money! But I didn't really intend to do anything but window shop anyway and thoroughly enjoyed that. </p>
<p>I was contemplating what to do for an early dinner, but had decided I could treat myself to something that I hadn't made myself. "Whole Earth" has lots of yummy vegetarian options to just heat up, and a favourite take-out dish for many years has been the sauteed tofu with broccoli and sauce from a old established Chinese restaurant. Kelly and I used to treat ourselves to this dish often, and sometimes sat in the car eating while one of the children napped.</p>
<p>However, I walked much further along the street than usual, just to continue my walk, and as I started back up to the main part of the street again, I spotted a brand new spot I hadn't seen before. It was busy and bustling with people lined up along a counter to order. I had no intention of eating out, but once I saw the menu on the wall, I changed my mind. It is the newest of a small chain of perhaps three or four spots called "Belanger"; Susan told me later that "Cafe Soleil" kitty corner to them is part of a it. The biggest problem I had was deciding what to order. The cauliflower soup sounded wonderful, as did several of the open faced sandwiches served with greens. </p>
<p>I finally opted for a veggie burger (after first checking to make sure it wasn't a commercially made one), with their homemade potato chips. I am a huge potato chip fan, so much so that I won't buy them to have in the house, as a full bag to me is just a reason to open it and eat every last crunchy bit hiding in the corners ... even the big bags! All three of my sisters like them too, but two can only eat a few, before feeling ill, and the other can eat a lot of them, but then feels sick later on. Not me, no problem! </p>
<p>I chose a table by the window, spotted a man next to me with his lovely looking salad as a side, and realized I should have ordered that too. So, I dashed up and asked if I could change my mind. Of course I could and the gal promised it would be up in just a few minutes. When the waiter brought it over, there was this wonderful looking sandwich tucked beside a lovely number of thin crispy chips! I did tell him I had changed my order, he offered to take it back and change it, I asked if those chips were now going to be thrown away (I would have kept them if they were), but he made such a kind suggestion. I could just eat them and he would bring me the salad on the side as well. Oh, what a lovely man he was! </p>
<p>Every bite of this meal was delicious! I ate the chips first as I always do (best to get them out of the way!), and then the sandwich ... a perfectly warmed soft French roll, some seasoned greens, with a very thin, quite firm, tasty patty topping them, then a seasoned and grilled portobello mushroom, and topped with two slices of Brie, just warm enough that it was starting to melt. Oh my gosh! I will be eating this dish again, but without the chips next time. That was just a little gift from heaven for me today. </p>
<p>I was more than ready for a hot cup of tea and a soft sofa when I got home. Susan called, kindly asking if I would like to join them for Amici's (my favourite!) pizza at their place, but of course I could not have eaten even one slice, so I declined, leaving them to dine with friends and their children, also invited over.</p>
<p>The next few hours passed by in the usual way. I had hoped to talk with the children in Japan when I got home, but even though I left IM and email messages I didn't hear back from Bryn until the children were all bundled up and ready to leave with their parents for a playdate with most of Mirei's classmates at what is supposed to be one of the nicer play areas in the city. They had been busy with other things and not on the computer, so Bryn assured me that they would connect tomorrow for sure. </p>
<p>The evening flew by too quickly, and I am heading up to bed much too late.</p>
