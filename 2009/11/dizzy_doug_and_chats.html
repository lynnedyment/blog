								<h2>Dizzy Doug and Chats</h2>
								<p>Doug and I both slept surprisingly long and well, despite both of us dozing off several times yesterday for long periods of time. Whew! I slept in until 8:45 body time but, as we moved the clocks backward last night, it was 7:45 on the clock. </p>
<p>Doug is feeling much the same as he has been for two days, and after lots of reading on the Web today, it sounds as though this could go on for some time, from several days to several months, and even up to several years in severe cases. So, fingers crossed here for a speedy recovery! </p>
<p>Doug is unable to read easily, but spent a little more time on the computer today than yesterday, so I was lucky enough to get a few photos done for my blog entries, as well as family tree photos too. </p>
<p>I continue to add jobs to my to-do list as I think of them, but managed to cross a few off today too. I am very excited about the upcoming trip to Japan, now eight days away, but am also prepared to cancel it if Doug is not over his imbalance. He is not able to bend over comfortably, certainly could not get out to drive, or maneuver much around on his own, so we shall play this out day by day and see what happens. Doug did lots of reading on the various things it could be, and even found a forty-five minute "exercise" that might get rid of any tiny crystal build-up that might be the culprit too. </p>
<p>I spoke with Susan, Amelia, and Finn today. They all had a good time last night, and Amelia told me she had collected a half basket of candy in her Hallowe'en pumpkin. Finn was still feeling sick and even though he claimed he wanted to talk in actual fact he just was not up to it. Poor wee guy. I may see him in the morning for a few hours, depending on how he is feeling then. </p>
<p>Bryn and I had a chat on IM and it was good to catch up a bit. Riku's piano teacher told Akane that she envies Riku his lovely singing voice. It was good to hear that, as Riku loves to sing, and there are lots of opportunities to do so at school. </p>
<p>Here is another bit of conversation between us.. said Bryn: "He was complaining about the piano stuff in his class ... "<strong>Too easy!</strong>" He says that he wants a challenge, like "this" (pointing to his music sheets)". I know how he loves to play the piano, although isn't always keen to practice, so it was good to hear that he feels this way. </p>
<p>Bryn went for his second run this morning at 5:30 along the river and said he enjoyed it very much, except for the running. It was a humid clear day there today and warmed up nicely during the day. </p>
<p>Riku wanted to talk to his Grandpa this morning, before going off to school, so they arranged a Skype chat just after Riku finished up his hot cereal. We both had a nice chat with him.Doug had the headphones on, but I put my ear next to Doug's so I could hear Riku, and see him too. (I'm like Mirei and can't resist seeing and talking to him too!)  How I miss seeing that little face! I am still getting used to him having his top two adult teeth in. How that changed him. </p>
<p>He had some questions for Doug about his hospital stays and they talked about needles and what else they did to him. He laughed when Doug told him about having to have bits of his "fur" shaved from his chest before they did one of the tests, an EKG. </p>
<p>Riku told me that he liked the Hallowe'en book I sent along with Bryn, and that he was going to Universal Studios tomorrow for the big Hallowe'en event there. He will be one of the UltraMan characters and Mirei a female cartoon figure I have forgotten the name of ... "Peach" or something. </p>
<p>Riku had asked me if I were coming to Japan soon. When I told him perhaps not because I couldn't leave Grandpa alone, he said "Maybe you should get a Grandpa-sitter."! How we laughed! </p>
<p>I am hoping to be there for his birthday on November the 13th, and Bryn called out that they would just have Riku turn seven when I did get there finally. That made Riku laugh. He wisely suggested that Doug use a cane, so Doug went off and got one he owns, and it does make walking easier for him. What a good suggestion! </p>
<p>Mirei was anxious to chat with us too, but we promised we could talk to her after Riku left for school. Later on in the day, we had that chat, and she was her usual bubbly self. They had all been to see a skin specialist, and Mirei told me she now had cream for behind her knee, for her bumps. </p>
<p>I took a snapshot of her too (blurry, but still so good to have), and we said goodbye, but she told me first that she missed me. I miss her too, very much, and do hope I see them both soon. </p>
<p>One of the things I crossed off my list today was the twenty Christmas cards I promised myself to write. They're done! </p>
