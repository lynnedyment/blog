								<h2>Happy 7th Birthday Riku!</h2>
								<p>If Riku were in San Francisco for his birthday, today is the day we would be having his family celebration. It's Friday here, but in not too many hours Riku will be having a party in Japan with his Mom, Dad, sister, Xiao (his Chinese tutor), Sugimoto (a boy from his grade one class), and best friend Juka (a little girl with whom he often walks home from school, and who came to the party with her mom and little sister). </p>
<p>I knew it would be a busy day today, so we were lucky to talk to Riku and Mirei in the morning. Riku had been tidying his room in anticipation of having guests there, although he is very neat and likes things in their place, so I don't imagine there was too much to do up there! Both Doug and I spoke with him for quite a long time, and he even opened a couple of gifts while we were on Skype ... his new skateboard(!) — he had guessed what it was from the wrapping, but was still thrilled to bits with it — and one of the books we gave him. </p>
<p>Mirei let him have lots of talking time before edging her way in to tell us about her day! I even got to read two stories to her, while Riku examined more of his gifts, although he sidled over to listen in too. Akane and Bryn were doing some prep' work for the party that would start at 1 P.M.. </p>
<p>Not long after our chat, I went off to meet Susan, Kevin, Amelia, Finn, and Amelia's friend Sheena at Goat Hill Pizza on Potrero Hill. We shared a big salad, and two pizzas, Finn played with a car, and Amelia and Sheena drew and chatted with some folks at the next table after dinner. It was fun, the pizza was delicious and it was casual and an early night too. I was home by 6 P.M. with some pizza slices for Doug. We went up to watch a British show and turned in early. </p>
<p>I went to sleep wondering what Riku would be wishing for when he blew out those seven candles! </p>
