								<h2>Ear/Nose/Throat Doc', and Skype Chats</h2>
								<p>Doug had an appointment with the specialist this morning at 10 A.M. We were hoping perhaps to confirm that Doug did indeed have an inner ear problem, but perhaps with an idea of which of the three types it might be. The visit lasted almost an hour and a half, and Doug was thoroughly examined; not just his ears but with a tube up behind his sinuses, and with a series of tests to check out hearing, etc. At the end of the appointment, Doug was told that perhaps it was not an inner ear problem but neurological after all. The next step is a visit to a clinic where they will submit Doug to a series of tests that have his eye movements being measured while they spin him and shake him 'round a bit. Despite a waiting list, Doug has been lucky enough to get an appointment in just three days in San Raphael, for which he is very grateful because the waiting is not something he wants more of. </p>
<p>My friend Judith called this morning before we left, and since it has been months since we have been in touch, we decided to finish up later on. Doug and I had a few errands to run after the appointment too. He can get around with his cane, as long as we are not moving too quickly and I'm sure being out is a good change for him too. </p>
<p>It was after 1 o'clock by the time we got home, and I called Susan to confirm that Amelia is out of school at 2:40 for pick-up, However, they had made other plans for a playdate with an old classmate it is hard to arrange after-school time with. This worked out at my end, since I had left home without eating, so I sat and read the paper, with a big brunch to see me through to dinner.</p>
<p>Bryn called through on Skype to see if I would like to chat with Riku before he left for school, and I was just delighted to see his face, snap a couple of photos of him, and hear all his news. He had a new Ultraman video that he was anxious to show me, explaining how to tell the good guys from the bad; one has blue eyes, and the other black. He enjoyed playing with the Wii at his aunt's and uncle's house, but much to his chagrin did not get to rush in on Friday night, wash his hands and play immediately. He had to wait until the next morning. Riku had just finished his fruit bowl, and was still in his PJs, looking rumpled and early morning sweet. </p>
<p>He had overheard me telling Bryn about Doug's tests, and wanted to hear about them himself. He mentioned my not being able to be there for his birthday and asked if I could be there for Christmas. Of course now I will not be going to Japan unless Doug is miraculously healed within a week, but Bryn seems fine with my going in the New Year too, when the excitement of the birthdays, Christmas, and New Year is over. </p>
<p>Mirei was still asleep when I was first talking to Riku, but she joined in with her PJs too, also looking early morning rumpled and slowly coming 'round. We got lots of smiles and she so kindly said that she would come to San Francisco with some cream, put it on Grandpa and rub him so he feels better. And she has plans to draw us a picture and give me a present of Cinderella with pretty pretty dresses, but who is "cool" too, and pretty. </p>
<p>I have been very curious about Mirei's first piano class on Friday, and she told me that she went to the teacher's house and she liked it, but that was all I heard. It will be such fun to hear her play soon! I know she was looking forward to having to practice. </p>
<p>Judy and I had another hour to chat after the children and I said goodbye; they both had to get ready for school. I called Kelly to see how she was doing: she went back to school today after missing most of the past three weeks, and was exhausted when she got home. She is going to try to go again tomorrow and perhaps take Wednesday off. She's still waiting for her appointment with a respirologist. </p>
<p>Good news! Don and Tessa are going to be in Niagara Falls on the 27th of December, so the crew from Toronto, and Doug and I too, will be there for sure! It has been almost a year and a half since we last saw them. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a British detective show, part of a series we enjoy. Doug is doing a little better at seeing it more clearly, although it is more likely that his brain is adjusting to do so. Sub-titled films are out of the question at the moment, but it's good to be back to relaxing for an hour upstairs together in the evenings. </p>
<p>The photos taken while I am on Skype are not high resolution pics but I am so grateful to have these images! </p>
