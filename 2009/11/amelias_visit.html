								<h2>Amelia's Visit</h2>
								<p>It has been too long since Amelia was here with me at home on her own, and we had a lovely two-and-a-half hours together. We picked her up after school at 2:40; Susan had forgotten to tell her that I would be picking her up, but she spotted me through the class window and I got a very big smile, while she held up the sweet paper bag turkey she had made. </p>
<p>I thought perhaps that Amelia might like to bake cookies, something we used to do quite often together on a Saturday morning, but the last time she was here she decided to do other things. This happened again today, as I gave her a choice of things to do, after we had shared some snacks.</p>
<p>She decided that first she wanted to do some of her old favourite activities on the computer. I pulled up the long list of possibilities and Amelia pretty well went at it on her own from there. She did the matching game, watched the falling-girl-on-the-balloons fall over and over, squashed bugs, and even did a turn on the Baby Type sounds that she liked so much when she was little. </p>
<p>Her next choice was to play doctor, actually vet, as she pulled out lots of animals and we sat on the bed, talking as animals, and treating them. Monkey had brambles pulled from his arm, the dog had a bandage removed, a squirrel got a needle, a bear had his blood pressure taken, and the mouse got some tender loving care. We sat on the bed, while I pulled out one animal after another, until they were all taken care of and tucked in. </p>
<p>I suggested we read a book, and Amelia thought we should read it in the bedroom with the animals around us. She went running off to choose a few books, and came back with just one ... the little photo album of Amelia's first two years that Susan had given me as a gift a few years back. We went through it together, page by page, looking at every photo and commenting on most of them. Amelia pointed out a photo where she thought she looked like Finn; she remembered a sweater with horses on it, as Finn wears it now, and we laughed about how she used to stick her lips out in a big kissy pouchy mouth, and send Riku running! I pointed out my favourite hats of hers, and she laughed at the bare belly and boot/shoe shots when she loved to walk around in her Daddy's footwear. It was a really sweet time with her ... just the two of us. </p>
<p>In the car I had told Amelia that I had a video of Riku at his birthday in Japan, blowing out his candles. She said she hadn't made him a card, and asked if she could make one here. We sat together at the table while she wrote him a little note with just a bit of help from me with some of the words. However, she wrote "I miss you" all by herself at the end of the first sentence, and signed it "Love, Amelia" too. There was room for a picture for him too, and I sat beside her as she drew a picture of the two of them. Amelia draws well, starting out in pencil to my surprise, and then colouring in all the details very carefully. She did a great job, and was rushing to finish it off before Kevin arrived. </p>
<p>I am hoping we can get back to our once-a-week visits, and we have four weeks left before I leave for Ontario. </p>
