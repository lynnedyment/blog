								<h2>Jet Leg and the Bay Area Discovery Museum</h2>
								<p>Much to my surprise, Mirei slept in until 9:45 this morning, a fifteen hour jet lag recovery! She awoke at 1A.M. and I joined her in bed, but she slept right through, long after I had left her room. I even managed to get a photo of her and she didn't budge! </p>
<p>It was a perfect San Francisco day; the sun was shining, the weather was warm, no wind, and the sky a beautiful blue, with no clouds. So, after quite a leisurely two hours at home, Mirei and I headed off for her first day's adventure, to the Bay Area Discovery Museum. Half an hour later, with heavier than usual traffic, Mirei was sound asleep! I let her sleep for a while in the car at the museum, but she finally roused with the comings and goings of the other cars. </p>
<p>We had lunch immediately, our usual picnic fare of a grilled cheese sandwich, and filled out with goodies I brought from home. I was surprised that Mirei chose to go to the indoor activity area first, rather than playing outside, but it was quiet and relaxing there today, with fewer people around than usual, so she quite enjoyed people watching at the clay table. </p>
<p>Not much later the craft room opened, and Mirei happily joined in, making a puppet face with a paper plate. It's interesting to see what a people watcher Mirei is! In both places, and perhaps moreso today because she was tired, she often just sits and observes others around her. She loved gluing pink "hair" onto her plate, and added eyebrows and lashes to the face too. </p>
<p>Her next stop was the toddler area. My guess is that she is going to be too tall for this spot next year. I hope not, as she still loves to meander from room to room there, jumping, lying, and relaxing on the water lily ponds, buzzing about the small climbing platform next door, and moving fast between the two. She made me laugh out loud when she spread out her legs over three areas of the place where she can make the frogs' bubbles visible by stepping on them. Too bad she didn't have a middle leg for this, as she managed to really stretch out those legs! </p>
<p>We spent a lot of time there, until I reminded her that the fish stream was outside, and that used up another half hour of our time. Before we left that area, she stopped to use the little chalkboard, and wrote her name, Nana, Riku, and Mommy all by herself. A fellow who works there, and had recognized her from previous visits (even asking where her big brother was!), was amazed. She likes to print too, as Riku does it and she wants to be just like him. All her favourite things were fitted in, ending with climbing on the boat, going through the giant log, climbing up the log steps all by herself, and ringing the bell several times at the top of the hill. </p>
<p>We left just as the museum was closing, at 4 P.M., so there was no time for the rolling pennies table today, but I promised her we would be there earlier next time. She managed to stay awake on the way home, and we stopped at Rainbow for a few groceries. </p>
<p>Mirei was practicing catching a big ball today with both Doug and me, and we did more practicing this evening. She's improving steadily and is very proud of herself!  Later she told me she liked my garden and went outside on her own, riding on the trike for a bit, and taking her babies out for a stroller ride. </p>
<p>We had dinner before the tub tonight; her baby got another hair wash, as did Mirei, and the bubbles were out too during tub time. It was a nice relaxing end to our day, and she was tucked in at 7:40 tonight. </p>
<p>At 10 o'clock Mirei woke up. Even though she is lying quietly, with me beside her for over an hour, it seems that sleep is eluding her, so I am off to join her now, at 11:30. That wee cat nap must have given her some extra mileage! </p>
