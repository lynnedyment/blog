								<h2>A Productive Day at Home, but Missing Mirei</h2>
								<p>Mirei had a breakfast date with her Dad and Mari early this morning. She woke up just before 7, but lay quietly beside me while I came to, and then we had our morning stretch and chat. No rush to get out of bed for something to put in that tummy, so we relaxed and then got up and got her dressed, ready for when Bryn pulled up with Mari at 8 o'clock. He had left a half hour earlier to pick her up, and Mirei was excited about spending time with her. They went off to "Just For You", their Toronto cousins' favourite breakfast spot too, and it sounds as though she liked the beignets as much as they do. Bryn said she was a delightful little dining companion, polite, making conversation, and eating well.</p>
<p>They all came back to the house about 9:15,  and while Bryn did two hours' work upstairs, Mari and Mirei went into her room to play together. I had Mirei's bedding in the wash already, and sat having my breakfast with the Sunday paper while the two had their quiet time together. Mirei came out to collect the coloured pencils as she was showing Mari how she could spell lots of words, and wrote Mari's name out too. We will have to include that in her spelling "tests" from now on. </p>
<p>Just before they left the house at 11, the two of them were in the bathroom with Mirei helping Mari put on her makeup. Yesterday she and Amelia were putting lip gloss on each other, and today Mirei got some practice in putting on eye makeup. She was quite serious about it, and it was sweet to watch. </p>
<p>They left for an oyster bake at the Tomales Bay Oyster Company, a birthday party for a casual friend of Mari's. Bryn thought they would be back about 3:30 but it was closer to 5:30! I had lots I wanted to work on, including tidying off my kitchen counters, and working on my emails and blog entries. </p>
<p>Doug worked really hard on my behalf cropping photos for my blog postings; there have been  lots of photos over the past two days and it was great to have a block of time to work on the postings and get those photos up in them. When I needed a break from the computer, I went back to my counters and was very pleased with all that I accomplished. I took two tea breaks too, reading with my feet up, so all in all lots got done around here.</p>
<p>However, this house was much too quiet! After about two hours I realized how much I am going to miss Mirei's company. She makes me smile and laugh, and I get outside too when she's here! Instead I got through lots of emails, sorted and tossed paper that came back with me from Ontario, and was anticipating Mirei's arrival. </p>
<p>And in she burst, with a big big smile, telling me she patted a cat, and fed it too, and rolled down the grass with lots of children. They had a great day and Bryn filled me in on the rest of it, with lots of photos to show me too. The weather was a little warmer north of Marin, on the coast, which was good, as it was cool enough here that we turned the heat on towards the end of the afternoon. </p>
<p>Mirei had tiny ravioli with pesto tonight and told me "I like pasta and I like pesto!" and ate every bite of it with gusto. She is so good about eating all her veggies too, broccoli and carrots tonight, and then was ready for her tub. </p>
<p>We have been using coconut cream on her skin and how Mirei likes to help put it on herself... on her tummy, chest, and legs tonight, while I covered her arms and back and the tops of her feet. After she brushed her teeth, I put some on her cheeks too. She was all pink and white and smiley and sparkling, looking ever so sweet in her PJs. I took out the camera to snap a few photos and she insisted I take one of her looking sad and one of her looking happy. Funny girl, is our Mirei! </p>
<p>Bryn went off to see a movie with Sean, and Mirei and I snuggled in to read "The Make-Believe Picnic" which she thoroughly enjoyed. The daddy in the book is a bit like her daddy and she liked that he was silly. He pretends the dining room table is a lake, and the stairs are a big hill, and everyone laughs. It's a lovely little story about having to make do with a picnic in the attic when the rain spoils their plans for an outdoor picnic, but I know that Mirei is really looking forward to tomorrow's story: "The Lost Teddy Bear". It's one of my very favourites and I know that she is going to like it too. </p>
<p>Bryn had told me that Mirei was a lovely travelling companion as well; she was on the plane trip over here, and in the back seat of the car, on her own, she sat for almost an hour completely absorbed in looking at all the books she insisted on taking with her. Then she napped for a half hour before they got there. On the way home, at her request, Mari sat in the back seat with her, which meant she stayed awake the entire way home. Thank goodness, as that earlier half-hour nap meant she had trouble falling asleep tonight, despite her very busy day running about in the fresh air. I crept out of the room at 8:15 tonight, but I know that tomorrow she will be back on schedule again. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a one-hour recorded TV show, and I got back to my emailing. Bed at 11 tonight so that I can read my new book. </p>
