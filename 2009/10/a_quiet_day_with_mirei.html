								<h2>A Quieter Day with Mirei</h2>
								<p>Mirei slept eleven and a half hours last night, waking at 7:10 this morning. We stayed in bed for a half hour after Mirei suggested "Let's just snuggle", just as her brother always did. I burrow down and listen to all the morning chatter. Riku liked to read as many books as we could on mornings like this, but Mirei is happy to talk about what we did yesterday, or what her animals are saying. She has been sleeping with a soft yellow and white dog, who sports a bandage from her administrations on Monday, so we talked about how he was coming along before we got up and on with our day. </p>
<p>Mirei snuck quietly down the hallway to check on her Daddy and just as she turned to leave, he growled and in she went to burrow with him for a while. During breakfast, Bryn and Mirei demonstrated a very silly thing they do together. Bryn points his finger at something specific and then Mirei, instead of looking where he is pointing, instead looks at his finger and says "I don't see butterflies ... or books, or whatever. Then they switch and Mirei does the same with Bryn. It is so funny to see and I must tape it sometime soon. Mirei often tells me funny things her dad does, and I think it amuses Bryn to hear me tell it to him later on. He obviously makes a very big impression on this little girl of his, and has passed on his own quirky silly sense of humour too. </p>
<p>We had a quiet morning at home.  Mirei watched a Caillou tape she hadn't seen before, while I took a long shower and tidied up a bit upstairs. Of course I always watch some of the program with her, as she likes company as much as Riku does. It's always fun to hear what they have to say about what's happening on the screen. I love to see her smiling as she watches the interactions between Caillou, his mom and dad, his sister, and his cat Gilbert. </p>
<p>Mirei likes her reading time, just as Riku did, but we always sit in the living room. She tucked a pillow behind both of us today, as we read four books, but decided she would rather share mine that use her own. She chose a new alphabet book today and goes over each page until she knows each new word for the letters. </p>
<p>Between her two breakfast courses we did some ball catching practice again, and what a difference a few days has made. Mirei was able to stand way back by the fridge while I sat in the kitchen area, throwing the ball to her and having her catch it! She did these long catches at least five times in a row, with lots of other good catches along the way, and she was one proud and happy little girl. </p>
<p>Doug went off to join Bryn for lunch at the newly changed (once more) Roosevelt Tamale Parlour, so Mirei and I went off with her trike to the mailbox. I can see what Doug meant about her wanting to do more interesting things with her trike, now that she has mastered the fine art of peddling and steering much much better too. Today she wanted to put one foot up on the back of the trike and use it like a scooter. I bet she would be great at that! But she went two full blocks today so certainly had her exercise peddling more up the slight rise than she did yesterday. </p>
<p>Once Doug was home he sat with Mirei while she wrote out the alphabet again, and I went upstairs with a hot cup of tea and read for twenty minutes. I must put up a photo of her printing as she is very proud of her letters and even circles the nice points on the capital A to show us she has done a good job there. </p>
<p>After that we did a Costco run, followed by a trip to Rainbow for major grocery shopping. Mirei is fun to have along with us, as she behaves very well and quite enjoys the whole experience. </p>
<p>Doug had to stop at Safeway for a few more items, so dropped us off at the newish playground on Bryant Street. Riku had been there in August, but it was Mirei's first time and it was a huge hit.  She spent lots of time in the toddler area, standing on the train calling out "All aboard!" as she did on Sunday at the park, bouncing with some bigger girls on a three seater bouncer (I have no idea what they are called), but then she discovered something new and exciting, and went to work figuring that out. It was a series of round rubber steps suspended by ropes, and she really had to concentrate to hold on to the swinging ropes and moving steps before moving on to the next one. But she just kept at it, doing it over and over again, until by the time Doug joined us, she pretty much had it down pat. I was so impressed with just how determined she was to get it right, and was so sorry I had forgotten to bring my camera along today. I will get back there with her though, as she would have been happy to spend more time. </p>
<p>Bryn was home and not busy working when we arrived, so he and Mirei had some silly fun times together. He put her on top of the fridge, made her howl with laughter while she was eating dessert, practiced ball throwing and catching with her, and was amused by her as she took hold of the door stop and used it as a microphone to sing us a very long complicated made-up song. </p>
<p>Bryn had been chatting with Akane on IM and arranged to have her put Riku on Skype with us. What a treat this was! Mirei was so happy to see Riku, her Baba (Akane's mother, who was visiting), and especially Akane. It was hard for Riku to get a word in edgewise, so Bryn took Mirei off to read for a few minutes so that I could talk to Riku on his own. </p>
<p>They had a typhoon in Japan and he was very excited about it. He slept with Akane last night, and said it was much quieter in the tatami room where she sleeps; I guess the wind must have been howling.</p>
<p> It was wonderful to see and talk to Riku, as it has been too long since we last managed a visit via the computer. He always looks so much older to me, and I love the way he talks and looks right at the camera so I get a good look at him.</p>
<p> I told him I had met Justin at the playground, and we managed to chat for a few minutes before it was time for him to leave for school. He never likes to rush and so said goodbye so he could leave ten minutes earlier than usual. Mirei did come dashing in and said "goodbye sweetie" to him! </p>
<p>Mirei has caught a cold! I noticed her nose running a bit towards dinnertime, although it didn't curb her appetite or her sense of humour one bit. However, with all the antics going on, we were running a little late for tubbing tonight, so skipped it. I knew she wanted to read the next story in our book, and she very much enjoyed hearing about Ben, Helen, their dog Dasher, and the little kitten Graysilk, who was the new member of their family. Once that was over, though, she asked if she could please look at the other pictures in the book and went over last night's story again too. </p>
<p>As we snuggled for a few minutes after turning out the light, Mirei said to me "Nana, I love your clothes, I love your back, I love your curly hair, and I love you very much." When I say "goodnight sweetheart" to her, she comes right back with the phrase for me, and it just makes me want to weep. </p>
<p>My back hurt so much last night when I lay down with her that I moaned out loud, and instantly Mirei put her hand on the small of my back and told me that would make it feel better. And of course it did! Tonight she asked me if my back hurt, and when I told her it did, she asked me to lift up so she could put her hand on it so it would get better. What a sweet thoughtful girl she is. I hope she always remains so sensitive to others. </p>
<p>I walked out at 7:35, with Mirei sound asleep, and after making some popcorn, went upstairs with Doug to watch part one of "Five Days", a five-part BBC drama. It was so good and ended on a real cliff hanger, so I suggested we watch part two as well. I must say that if I didn't have things to do downstairs I would happily have sat and watched part three as well! </p>
