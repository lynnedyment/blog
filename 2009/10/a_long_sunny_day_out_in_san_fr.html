								<h2>A Long Sunny Day in San Francisco</h2>
								<p>Mirei woke at 6:30 this morning, when I woke to go to the bathroom. I told her it was too early to wake up, and so she rolled over and went back to sleep until 7:30! She strolled into the kitchen, rubbing her eyes, and I asked her if she wanted me to snuggle with her. She did, and shut the door, saying we could have some "quiet time together". We stayed in bed until after 8, singing and snuggling and talking more about the ice show yesterday. I think Mirei's favourite part was the girl who cut off her hair "to protect her daddy." Bryn had talked to her after the show about why she did that, and it obviously sunk in. </p>
<p>We had a nice lazy morning playing with Play-Doh (we made lots of sliced cookies today and never did get around to the cherry pie she set out to make), and she told her daddy she was "too busy to wave goodbye". Nonetheless, she did run to the window to blow kisses to him (as she always does here), as he walked to a local caf√© to work. </p>
<p>Susan had invited us to join them at a Hallowe'en get-together with Amelia's old Belvedere nursery school group. It was being held in the little playground across the street from their old apartment building, and included pumpkin carving and a puppet show. We arrived before they did, but Nancy Kittle, a family friend of theirs, was there too, so we got to chat for a few minutes before they arrived. I hadn't seen Nancy since January and we caught up during the few hours that we were there. </p>
<p>Kevin was carrying four pumpkins when they arrived and Mirei and I were the lucky recipients of one of them. I cut off the top and scraped it out, but left it to carve at home. There was so much going on ... the pumpkin show was adorable, and held all of the children's attention for most of it. Kevin and Finn were busy carving a pumpkin or two, and Amelia sat with her little one, concentrating on doing it herself. Susan got caught up with lots of old and new friends and acquaintances, and the time passed quickly. There were plenty of goodies to eat too, from pastas to fruit to desserts, and Mirei filled up on mac' and cheese. Later in the afternoon she tried a little Hallowe'en dessert in a cup, and had a few bites before handing it over to me. </p>
<p>Mirei had the best time just running around and playing with whatever children were available. There were many there who were from the older school group, although there were younger siblings there too. She and Kevin had a few minutes together as well; she was pretending she was the captain of a ship and Kevin was a passenger being blown over by the rough seas. Another dad had taken part in this scenario earlier and how Mirei loved entertaining them both. </p>
<p>A little later she came upon another three-year-old girl, and then another, and soon the trio had taken over the slides and were sliding down in unison, arms in the air, and trying out belly and back sliding too. Mirei was happy just sliding down the conventional way for the most part and so enjoyed all that time with the girls. Their moms came over to take photos, too; it was too cute, and they played together for the longest time. </p>
<p>Once the crowd had thinned, and we had said goodbye to Susan and family at 2 o'clock, Mirei wanted to stay and play. There were far fewer children there once the Belvedere group left, but there was a darling little boy, Lars, with his mom, and so the play slowed down to accommodate this little twenty-one-month old. He shared a ball of his with Mirei and she shared her snacks with him. She followed after him, watching out for him, but also held his hand and just walked with him. Lisa, Lars' mom, and I sat and chatted and watched the two of them interact. It was really sweet, and just before we left a second much younger little boy joined us with his dad. Lars shared a second ball with him, although he was too little to really join in. Mirei was so gentle with Lars, and his mom was smitten with her. At one point Mirei pointed out her "big muscles" to the dad, and insisted he feel them, holding out both arms in the classic pec' display. Of course then he had to show her his muscles so that she could feel them! Lisa was next, and even Lars demonstrated his. Quite the crowd pleaser is this girl! </p>
<p>It was after 3:30 when we left the playground, and I didn't want Mirei to sleep on the way home. She was a trouper and sat drawing picture after picture for me, mostly of pumpkins, all the way home, as well as singing along to the children's tape we have heard a dozen times. Mirei's favourite song on the tape is "This Old Man, he plays one ..." but it doesn't come 'round often enough for her. However, we stretched our sillies out and yawned our sleepies out and did well all the way to Rainbow. She had started to droop by that time, but the stop perked her up. She had a cheese sample, and we found the little doll perched in the rafters, and she chose some vanilla sorbet for dessert. One of the mothers, Stephanie (I believe), from Riku's first grade class, was the cashier next to us; she recognized both Mirei and me and stopped to say hello to us. </p>
<p>Mirei got into the tub right away while I prepared a fried rice dish for dinner. She has taken to selecting just a few of the plastic toys to play with, separating the "boys" from the "girls" (based on some colour scheme only she understands). </p>
<p>She ate dinner, with Bryn sitting with her for the last half of it, while I went upstairs for twenty minutes with a cup of tea and a magazine. Bryn had dashed off to a local sports store when we got home with the car, and while I was upstairs Mirei tried on his new shoes. I discovered the photo Doug had taken after she was tucked into bed. And during her playtime before bed, I found her chatting away in the bathroom on one of her play phones, sitting on a small wooden stool, talking first to Auntie Candy, and then Caillie. I snapped a photo, but did some video recording too.  </p>
<p>Mirei was asleep at 7:20 tonight, after two fun stories she had picked out. One is a pop-up book of animals, each being eaten by a bigger and more ferocious one, and she liked it so much we read it twice. Glenna bought this for Kelly's Bryn when he was a little fellow, and it's still in great shape fourteen years later. </p>
<p>Doug and I went upstairs to watch a documentary on oil, and learned how quickly we are really going to run out of it. One of the surprising things I learned is that many of the experts believe that the children of the children now growing up, the Riku's and Amelia's of the world, may never experience air travel, as it will be available only to those who are very wealthy. </p>
<p>I had such a relaxing day, with lots of sitting, and so felt energized enough to tackle the ironing while we watched. It took me two hours and it's done. Nice to have that off my to-do list, as I really believed I wouldn't do it until after Mirei and Bryn leave, in just four more days. Hard to imagine not having this sunny little girl in my days here soon. </p>
