								<h2>No  Visitors or "Tot Spot" Today</h2>
								<p>Today was a day of disappointment on two counts, and yet it ended well despite them both. We had been expecting a doula mom over with her under-one-year-old this morning, and since yesterday morning, when I told Mirei about it, she had been looking forward to playing with him. Anticipating their arrival at 10:30, we kept busy in the usual way, with breakfast, Mirei writing her alphabet, a cup of hot chocolate in a pink metal cup, and a few Caillou episodes as we waited. But we waited an hour past the time they were due, and then made a quick decision to go off to Berkeley to a fun indoor play area called "Tot Spot". It was too windy for any outdoor activities this morning, so it seemed perfect, and was on my mental list of places to go with Mirei. </p>
<p>It was close enough to lunch time that we decided to have pizza out, a rare treat for us these days. at our favourite spot in Berkeley: "Zachary's". Mirei kept telling me she didn't want pizza today, so I had packed her up a generous snack, with her favourite yogurt included. I sat with her in the back seat, as we both enjoy singing and chatting and looking outside at anything that catches our eyes, and Mirei had her yogurt on the way there. However, she also had a big slice of pizza cut up in small bites, and enjoyed looking at all the posters on the walls, of pizzas, and reading all the letters out to us from them too. </p>
<p>Doug had a dizzy spell this morning, sitting in front of his computer, and on the way to Berkeley he felt another one coming on. They both lasted just a few minutes, but we pulled the car over and I drove into the city. He is a bit stuffy and felt it was an inner ear problem. He dropped Mirei and I off at Tot Spot, parked the car, and by the time he got back to us, Mirei and I had discovered that they are no longer open during weekday afternoons! We were so disappointed, but we had lots of fun chatting with a young woman who worked there, and was on her way home. She admired Mirei's shoes of choice this morning... one pink with flowers, and one navy blue with cross-over straps. What a funny little girl she is, and she was so pleased that someone noticed too! </p>
<p>We played "I spy with my little eye" all the way home, and Grandpa played with us too. It was still a cool overcast day, but we both needed some fresh air. So, we dropped Doug off at home and went to the playground at the top of the hill. I suggested we go to the one with the moving steps she likes so much, but she said she wanted to go to the closer one. I was surprised, but pleased too, as we didn't have a lot of time before getting home for bath time, etc. There were a few children there, and Mirei was a happy girl running around in the too-cool-for-me air! She even wanted her light jacket off. There was lots of time to climb up the slides, and pretend she was a bear in a cage, as she ran all over and down the play structure. All the grownups were huddling up in their jackets and sweaters, suggesting it was time to leave, and so close to 5 o'clock we too headed home. Brrr! </p>
<p>Mirei had her tub before dinner, and then asked for the Play-Doh. She is really enjoying cutting out "ccokies" and doing a great job at pressing them out clearly and cleanly. She does this by going "wiggle, wiggle, wiggle" with not only the cutter in the dough, but with her whole hip area too. It is just so cute that I found myself asking her to do another "wiggle, wiggle, wiggle" to make sure it was cut properly. Tonight she made so many of the little people I told her they might be my brothers and sisters, and so she made enough that we could name everyone from Uncle Ian down to Uncle Don, the "baby". She knows all about my brothers and sisters, and her cousins and uncles and aunts, and it's fun teaching her how they fit into our family. </p>
<p>Tonight Mirei chose two little books to read, and we snuggled as always for the few minutes it took her to fall asleep. These nights will soon be over... </p>
