								<h2>Pennies and Puddles and Hallowe'en Windows</h2>
								<p>It's raining, it's pouring... at last! It started up last night, our first heavy rainfall since last May perhaps, and it was lovely lying in bed listening to it as I drifted off to sleep. Mirei woke just before seven o'clock and after saying good morning, said "Listen Nana! Do you hear something?" Yesterday I had told her there was no mud to play with at the playground because we needed rain to go with the dirt, and so she was quite excited about the possibility of mud today! </p>
<p>Apparently, this is the tail end of the typhoon that hit Japan a few days ago, and given that it was really gusty and pouring rain hard most of the day, I can only imagine what the winds and rain must have been like there. </p>
<p>Doug and Bryn were both out of the house until mid-afternoon, so Mirei and I had a quiet few hours on our own. We both watched part of "Dumbo", with Mirei paying attention to her dolls and with me puttering about here and there, finishing off some chores, both up and downstairs. At one point Mirei packed herself up with her backpack again, her lunch "box", a soft cloth bag and the stroller looking ever so much the part of the very busy mom. </p>
<p>I promised Mirei that after lunch we would decorate the windows, and while pulling out the decals, I came across all the Hallowe'en books too. Mirei was delighted with them, and sat for at least a half hour going through each one thoroughly. By then I had the windows cleaned on the inside, and we spent the next half hour with Mirei carefully placing them where she could easily see them. We sang one of our favourite Hallowe'en songs, and certainly Riku's very favourite one that starts off "It's Hallowe'en, the lamp is lit... " </p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon passed quickly; Mirei used the fallen petals from the tulips as decorations on my stovefront, using lots and lots of pieces of Scotch tape to make sure each one stayed in place. It looks quite lovely! Then she did a "painting"by rubbing the petals against and up and down the paper and she quite enjoyed that too. We got a lot of mileage out of those petals! I didn't get a photo of it fast enough though, as she then went over it with markers and it's hard to see what the original looked like... very soft and delicate. We will try to find more flowers with more colours and do this again. We turned over the page, and did a dot drawing; Mirei started off with one of the "stamper" markers, doing a particular number of stamps, then I would follow with a different stamp but the same number, and so we were filling up our page quite nicely when Bryn walked in. </p>
<p>I wanted to get her outside for a little change, and so she, Doug and I went off to Costco, and then stopped at Safeway and the post office. We found some great puddles in all three places, and Mirei and I jumped in as many as we could, although with her frog puddle boots on she was a little more enthusiastic in her jumping. However, besides these big puddles, Mirei found a penny, and then found another in the car. This always makes her very happy and it reminds me of the few times I dropped pennies on the sidewalk for Riku to "find". </p>
<p>Mirei is learning to spell and tonight at dinner we spelled out a few words using the rubber letters. We're a bit restricted as we have only one of each letter, but it was fun and Mirei was keen. She called out letters from a few of the pages of the books we read today too. I keep thinking how Kelly would love to have this keen little girl in her kindergarten class. The youngest of her pupils are Mirei's age, as they too will turn four before the end of the year. </p>
<p>Mirei found a small table cover today and used it as a fashion accessory, winding it first around her waist, then around her neck, in two different ways, and finally around her head, with a little help from me to get it to stay put. She spent quite a bit of time admiring herself in the kitchen "mirror", the window of the lower oven. Mirei gets warm quickly though and soon had it off and moved on to other activities that kept her cooler. </p>
<p>We booked flights for Ontario today, for both Doug and me, and booked me for Japan as well. We are now waiting to book Doug, as soon as he finds out about some possible dates for classes next month. Nice to have that settled although I am not going to have much time for organizing at either end of the trips to and from Japan and to Ontario, but somehow it all works out. I just have to start making serious lists tomorrow! </p>
<p>At dinner tonight, Mirei brought up for the first time the age old question about death. She asked me if I was going to die one day, and I told her yes, but not for a long long time. She was upset for a minute or two, protesting as children always do, that they don't want us to die. The conversation didn't last long, thank goodness, but I know it will be brought up again sooner or later. </p>
<p>I made a potato omelette for dinner tonight, and Bryn was here with us. He had Mirei laughing so hard; she is such a great appreciative audience for his particular brand of silliness. They are such a funny pair, and along with that sense of humour is Mirei's very loving personality. Everyone gets big impulsive hugs and kisses throughout the day, along with proclamations of her love. Bryn said he will take every bit of all this loving while it lasts. Hard to imagine Mirei being an indifferent teenager one day, but one never knows.  :) </p>
<p>Mirei was asleep at 7:45 tonight, and I went up to watch a taped show, with my feet up. My back is very sore tonight, perhaps because I lifted Mirei a lot today for some reason. It's hard to resist though, as she is a cuddler for sure. And when she knows my back hurts, she is quick to put her tiny hand right on the sore spot at my waist, and often strokes my head, whispering quietly "shhh, it's okay, it's okay." I think she is going to be a wonderful doula one day! She's quick with the words, the pillows behind the back and the concerned expressions too. </p>
