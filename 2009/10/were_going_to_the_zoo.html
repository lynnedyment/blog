								<h2>We're Going to the Zoo!</h2>
								<p>I woke up at 6:30 this morning, and even though I was very quiet, Mirei woke up at the same time and decided she had to go to the bathroom too. I was sure that was it, that she was awake for the day, but I was amazed that just minutes after snuggling back into the duvet, Mirei was breathing quietly and slept for another hour. I dozed on and off, and was watching her sleep when those eyes opened up. She always looks over and smiles, as though questioning whether it's okay to be awake, and today when I answered her "good morning!", she said "That was <strong>fast</strong>!", meaning, I assume, the night. Perhaps she thought it only lasted that one final hour! </p>
<p>Mirei had suggested yesterday that we go to the zoo, but I thought Doug had something going on today that required him having the car. I was wrong, and so the zoo was on after all, much to Mirei's delight. I decided we would spend the morning at home, and head out after lunch, avoiding the need to carry our lunches around the vast zoo grounds. </p>
<p>I had some cards and letters to write, so after Mirei had time with her "babies", and I cleaned up the kitchen, I joined Mirei while she watched "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".  In between watching the bits she had questions about, I got quite a bit accomplished. This worked well and it gave me a chance to put my feet up too, before the busy afternoon got started. </p>
<p>Mirei asked if she could ride her trike this morning, and so Doug took her out, up and down the block again, although Doug said today she was more interested in a more exciting ride, perhaps standing on the seat while he pushed her! Guess she feels she has that pedaling down pat. </p>
<p>We got to the zoo at 1 P.M. and left just after 4. We covered a lot of territory during that time too, and still didn't see the bears, all the Australian animals, or the tigers, so we will go another day. We did see lots, though ... the male lion wandering about, the baby gorilla climbing on a biggish rock, while his mom looked on ... and then disappeared on him, causing him to slide down off the rock head first, scrambling after her. </p>
<p>The giraffes were wonderful to see, as always; Mirei pointed out the zebra, and now knows that male peacocks are the ones with the pretty feathers. Today Mirei was determined to climb on every animal sculpture she came across, and I think I got photos of every one of them! </p>
<p>We went to the farm area, and Mirei got up the courage to feed the rambunctious goats, with some help and security management from Grandpa. She did a great job, though, and for the last two-thirds of the feeding she was keeping her hand nice and steady and not minding their being a little aggressive. Mirei enjoyed watching the tiny chicks, not long ago hatched out, and felt the woolly sheep too. </p>
<p>I think her favourite part of the zoo of all today, though, was watching a tiny alligator, who was sitting on a turtle, and then watched as the zoo keeper picked him up so that the turtles could be fed. She spent a lot of time moving about and peering into the water to see them, and watched an owl for a long time too. We should probably take her once a week while she's here just so she really gets to know her animals. Today she showed so much interest in so many of them. </p>
<p>We all spent some time watching the gophers today; Mirei grinned away as she got to pretend she was one of them. And she seemed to enjoy watching the meercats too, just like her Grandpa, who finds them fascinating. </p>
<p>A special big treat for her today was candy floss, the first time she has asked for it. Before buying it, though, we went into the caf√© so she could eat a yogurt for her mid-afternoon snack, visited the farm area, and then she had the floss. Interestingly, even though she really liked it, it wasn't too long before she handed me back her last piece and said we should save some for another day. It will be interesting to see if she asks for it tomorrow. Riku likes it too, but ate even less of it than Mirei did, before saying he didn't want any more of it. </p>
<p>On the final leg of our day at the zoo, Mirei decided to ham it up. She pulled her arms out of her shirt, and walked the rest of the way out of the area with her shirt up, patting her belly, posing with silly faces, and walking backwards. It was just hilarious and she attracted lots of attention, which just egged her on. What a girl! I think she needs a t-shirt that says this! </p>
<p>I could see that Mirei was close to drifting off in the car on the way there, so we opened our windows up a bit, and did a little game of naming letters and numbers. This kept her busy and happy, and she was active and busy all the time we were at the zoo. On the way home she went back to the paper and pencil drawing and naming letters, and she wasn't even close to drifting off, much to my surprise. </p>
<p>Bryn bought a new skateboard today, and Mirei was so very interested in it. I don't know if this bodes well for the future, what with her desire to stand on her trike at this stage! Bryn put her on it in the kitchen and she grinned away as he scooted her up and down the kitchen area. I got a video of it too, which made her laugh. </p>
<p>Mirei has been playing with Play-Doh a lot during her meals; it's a treat for her to just sit and roll it, press out shapes, and blow out little circles using a hollow tube. It's one of her favourite pastimes and there is lots of it here for her. </p>
<p>Quick tub time after dinner tonight, and then I read her the first of the seven stories from "The Everyday Story Book" that I won when I was in grade one. All of the grandchildren know these stories, and of course their parents too, so I'm glad I remembered to read Mirei "Sally's Lost Shoe" tonight. She enjoyed it very much and we shall continue with the rest of the stories this coming week. </p>
<p>It was a grand day, and the weather was perfect for it as well. Our busy girl was asleep at 7:35 tonight, and I got lots of emails cleared up. </p>
