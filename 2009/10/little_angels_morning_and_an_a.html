								<h2>Little Angels Morning and an Afternoon of Baking</h2>
								<p>Mirei woke at 7 this morning, but wanted to "just snuggle for a while, Nana" before getting out of bed. So we did, and a half hour later it was time to get hustling! Bryn was taking her off for four hours at Little Angels. I was a little concerned that she would decide she didn't want to go, and I wasn't looking forward to her being upset about it. But she came through like a trouper, and showed no hesitation at all about getting there. Breakfast was a little more hurried than usual, but she ate two scrambled eggs, instead of her standard one poached egg, and ate some yogurt as well. Bryn said that she didn't look back when he walked her in, but headed right to the back of the room. </p>
<p>Bryn had suggested that I book an appointment with Valerie, the acupuncturist I see occasionally (but not as often as I should). I intended seeing her right after my fall in May, but I couldn't imagine being able to get up on the treatment table or moving around with any degree of comfort, and then life got busy. So, today was the day, and it was very successful. Valerie worked on all the areas of my middle back that still trouble me, especially if I am not putting my feet up often enough, and after two hours I left her office feeling so much better. That night in bed was the first night (after busy days) that I didn't moan even to myself as I lowered myself down.</p>
<p>I went home for a quick bite to eat, and picked Mirei up at 1:30; I even had to wait a few minutes as she was "working on somethin'." She didn't talk a lot about her day, but I did learn that there is a new teacher there, a man, and that a little boy said something rude to her. "That's not very nice, right Nana?" I don't think it was anything too serious though.  </p>
<p>As soon as we got home, she suggested "let's bake somethin''" and even had a suggestion as to what to bake: gingerbread cookies. Mirei is a baker! We agreed that we wouldn't make gingerbread men, but instead would make smaller cookies in different shapes. So hands washed, aprons on, and we were busy for the next two hours. Not only did we make the gingerbread dough (though will make the cookies tomorrow), but we made date squares too. </p>
<p>Between baking sessions, as we waited for dough and dates to cool, Mirei used her female multi-tasking skills and took care of her baby. This boy baby was not very co-operative about getting dressed, so I took a series of photos of that event, as well as the baking and this, and the next two blog entries will show how busy we were today! </p>
<p>Bryn was home working for the day upstairs and while I prepared dinner, he took Mirei out for the first time to see her on her trike. They were out for a nice long ride, which Mirei thoroughly enjoys. She knows she needs "exercise and some fresh air, right Nana" and this is a fun way for her to get it on busy days. Mirei took a tumble while driving over a bump in the sidewalk, but she came in and told me she didn't hurt and she didn't cry. Her leg was a bit scraped though, as I noticed in the tub later on. </p>
<p>Bryn was home for dinner with us tonight, and we had a stuffed pasta—tiny raviolis—that Mirei has been asking for each time she opened the fridge over the past three days. We had a fresh tomato and fresh mozzarella cheese salad but Mirei claims not to like tomatoes, so had three side veggie dishes instead, and lots of the ravioli. </p>
<p>Mirei was asleep at 7:45 tonight, after reading the third story in our new book. Tonight's story was about Skippy, a little dog who goes into the house next door to his and is on his own there for three days and nights. Mirei is very interested in all the little details and can tell her daddy all about it the next day. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched the next two episodes of our British mini-series. One to go. I was relaxed and tired and didn't get any emailing done today at all. One day... </p>
