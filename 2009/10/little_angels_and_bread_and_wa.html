								<h2>Little Angels and "Flour and Water"</h2>
								<p>Mirei and Bryn both awoke this morning at 7 A.M. I awoke a half hour earlier and came downstairs showered and ready to get this little girl off to her Japanese nursery school program. She has been quite keen about it, and was looking forward to going again this morning. The house was already warm, so off she went in the same little outfit she wore yesterday, knowing she would be plenty warm enough in what was obviously going to be another hot day. </p>
<p>Bryn drove her to school again, pointing out all the old sites she recognizes, and drawing her attention to new ones too, the latest being palm trees. For the past two or three days she has been telling me each time we passed a palm tree, something Bryn told her about on their way to Tomales Bay last Sunday. </p>
<p>Mirei is picking up on new words and expressions so quickly these days, and is very eager to learn the right way to say things, placing her tongue exactly how we tell her to, and repeating a phrase over and over in the few days after she has heard it. </p>
<p>I have started a long list of things that need to be done before my two trips, but had to take care of some phone calls today, and some photos for Gail that she wants to copy. Doug and I went through the pics of their trip here last November, and Doug will get busy cropping those soon. How I would love to have two solid weeks to work just on photos, but instead I take dozens a day and it's hard for Doug to keep up with those these days, never mind get to the much older ones. All in good time though. </p>
<p>I wrote a letter to Riku, and sent off a postcard I had picked up for him from a booth at the Toronto book fair, featuring "Where the Wild Things Are". I know he will like the bookmarks I enclosed with the card too. I have a few more letters that need to be hand written and must try to get to those tomorrow. </p>
<p>Of course my four hours alone here flew by, but I was also looking forward to two hours at the beach with Mirei. I packed up a filling snack for her, and walked in to find her dressed in a princess dress, along with four other little girls, and Mirei not wanting to stop playing! So, there I was with almost an hour and a half on my own. I hadn't had lunch, so walked to a wonderful bakery called Arizmendi, just two blocks up from Mirei's school, ordered a slice of their always tasty pizza — today's flavour was spinach, cheddar cheese, & mushrooms, with garlic oil and parsley — and a big cup of milky tea, and sat very happily for the hour working on Sudoku puzzles. I have been keeping a book of them in the car for such rare occasions as these when I have a few spare minutes. I gave a minute or two thought to how much more I could have gotten done at home, but then just gave it up and relaxed and enjoyed this forced leisure time. </p>
<p>Mirei was a happy little camper when I picked her up, and chatted all the way home. She told me they don't do letters in Japanese school, or numbers, and they don't play games, but they do sing and play with the children. Sounds perfect to me. </p>
<p>We had made plans to go out for pizza tonight, Bryn's treat, to a spot that has been getting rave reviews. However, it is on the other side of town, where parking is often impossible, and so Bryn suggested we eat at another spot that has also been getting great reviews, called "Flour and Water". Bryn has eaten there before and liked it very much, and since it is in the Mission, it wasn't more than a ten-minute drive there. We arrived at 5:05 and there were two couples in the line, for the 5:30 opening. Doug stood and held our place while we went off to find a place to park. Within the two minutes that parking took, there must have been ten more people in the line, and there may well have been twenty-five there by the time the doors opened at 5:30. </p>
<p>Mirei had a little walk up and down the street with Bryn and me while Doug waited, and so she was happy sitting quietly and well behaved during dinner. She drew pictures for Doug and me, nibbled on Acme bread with olive oil, declined the wonderful fall salad and the tiny roasted and perfectly seasoned Brussels sprouts, but thoroughly enjoyed the Margherita pizza. Bryn and I had glasses of a delicious dry red wine as well, and we all shared a single but generous portion of a dark chocolate pots-de-crème-style dessert as well. Doug took Mirei for another walk outside while Bryn and I finished up our wine, and Mirei presented me with a big handful of bougainvillea petals that she had discovered on her walk. It was a fabulous evening out for me, and I enjoyed it so very much. </p>
<p>Mirei was tired, and had been resting her head on Bryn's shoulder just before we went into the restaurant, but was just an absolute pleasure to have at the table with us. She had Bryn and me switch seats halfway through dinner, and gave me lots of hugs and kisses in between the drawings that kept her busy. She also gave me a "Snow White" kiss and we showed it to her Daddy for the first time. This was Mirei's idea yesterday and it makes me laugh. She knows we don't kiss children on the lips in our family, but she just started yesterday on giving me a "Snow White" kiss, which means a very light tender little kiss on my mouth. </p>
<p>Bryn wanted me to catch up on my two blog entries, so volunteered to get Mirei ready for bed and tucked in tonight. And of course, once again I asked her what she should do if she woke up and found herself alone. This time (yes!), the answer was "roll over and go back to sleep.", and then in a quieter voice she said "and cry." She knew this would make us laugh, though, and in fact she hasn't called out for the past week or so. Not to anyone's surprise she was asleep very quickly, just past 7:30.</p>
<p>Bryn and Doug went off to a movie at 8 P.M. and I got busy writing three posts and adding the photos that Doug had done for me today. </p>
<p>Had a nice chat with Kelly during the evening, too, so that was a plus. I should go off to bed soon and get another good night's sleep under my belt. I know I will accomplish more tomorrow if I just do it! </p>
