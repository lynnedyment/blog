								<h2>Not the Day We Expected to Have!</h2>
								<p>I checked my email as soon as I came downstairs today and was happy to have one in from Bryn, saying that Mirei got a ten out of ten as a traveling companion, and that they were at the shuttle stop, waiting for their trip home. Later I heard that Mirei slept only one hour of the eleven hour flight, but was a happy and engaged girl all her waking hours. She didn't even sleep on the shuttle on the way home, which really surprised me! </p>
<p>That was good news to start my day as the rest of it was one of those days that makes you realize that you can make plans and then sit back and watch as they all go awry. I had a few clothing items to buy for birthday/Christmas gifts, and wanted to get them bought immediately so that they could be mailed before leaving for Japan. Doug and I had decided to go to the Vacaville outlet mall this morning, have lunch, spend a few hours there and head home mid-afternoon. The trip took longer than usual, as the Bay bridge has been closed down for repairs since Tuesday, so we took the longer "scenic" route, adding perhaps an extra 3/4 hour to the usual fifty minute trip! </p>
<p>Fifteen minutes from Vacaville, Doug felt another of his "spells" coming on, so we pulled over and I drove the last bit to the mall. We decided we would have lunch right away, giving Doug a little time for this to settle down. He was fine for about half an hour, and then he felt another coming on ... but this time it did not leave. In minutes he was very very pale, felt nauseous, and the room was spinning. He didn't eat another bite, didn't want to leave right away, so I got some tea and we sat for perhaps a half hour. We talked about whether it made sense to try to get to a hospital in Vacaville, not sure if there even was one, but decided it made more sense to get back to the SFGH just a few blocks from home, and one of the best trauma hospitals in the States. It's a teaching hospital and we knew there would be good people there to check him out. Two staff members in the restaurant stood on each side of him and guided him to the car. </p>
<p>Doug closed his eyes all the way home, as opening them made him feel woozy, but he was able to tell me just where we were on that trip ... coming to the end of the small main road we took going home, getting on to the 101, on and off the bridge and the exits and on-ramps. It was a little game that kept him occupied and awake. </p>
<p>We drove right to the ER, and staff came out with a wheelchair to get him inside. When I came back after parking the car, he was undressed, on a gurney, and had already started answering questions about why he was there. So much happened after that ... Doug had an EKG, several visits from different doctors, most of them neurologists, had a CT scan done, and when they discovered that there was a self-healed formerly torn carotid artery, they decided to check that out with an MRI. They ruled out a stroke at the back of the head with that test, and were deciding on whether they should go in and redo that carotid artery. </p>
<p>This all took many many hours, as the ER was filled with people lined up in the hallways, where Doug was as well, but his situation was very controlled and not quite so outwardly dramatic as the drunks, the men who had been beaten up or roughed up or had done the roughing up, as well as the woman who signed herself in after trying to commit suicide, and then spent an hour trying to convince every staff member who walked by to give her clothes back to her. They took them after she dressed herself three times, exposing most of her body to whomever happened to be there while she was doing this. </p>
<p>In the middle of the night, things had quieted down enough that we were given a private room. Doug did quite a lot of dozing in between all the medical visitors, but I found it hard to sleep on the hard chair, with no place for my feet, and all the lights blazing. </p>
<p>Doug continued to feel nauseous and light-headed whenever he was asked to stand or move around at all, so the puzzle was yet to be solved as we approached Hallowe'en. </p>
