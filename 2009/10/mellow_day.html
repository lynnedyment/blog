								<h2>Mellow Day at Home , with the Blue Angels Overhead</h2>
								<p>Mirei woke just after 7 A.M. today, another eleven and a half hours sleep for her. Today we hid under the covers so that Doug could find us, just as Riku did from the time he was a very little guy. And how she giggled, giving away our hiding place instantly! It didn't matter a bit; as she was still delighted at being found. </p>
<p>Days are busy with this little girl, right from the moment she wakes up. She's like me, happy to chat away from the very beginning of her day until the end of it, when I have to remind her that it's time to slow down and relax and get ready to sleep. But it's all systems go when those big brown eyes peer into mine to make sure I am awake. She's incredibly thoughtful, as she lies there quietly beside me until I open my eyes, never waking me. However, as I was with Riku, I am very much aware of those eyes on me, and that face just inches from mine. Such a sweet awakening this is! We have started stretching in the mornings, reaching up to the ceiling with our arms, stretching our legs down as far as we can, and ending with a nice back stretch too. </p>
<p>Mirei enjoyed a poached egg on toast this morning, eating up every bite, and then asked for hot chocolate, as I had. Of course we got out her pink cup for this special treat, and I do hope it's something she will always remember. I bought this sweet set at a farm auction when Kelly was a young girl, and the cups have been used by many children over the years. </p>
<p>Doug was giving a talk in the East Bay, and had to leave at 10:30, Bryn had left at 7 for a meeting in the South Bay, and so Mirei and I were home on our own. We accomplished so much: I vacuumed this level, while Mirei "worked" up on my bed, keeping busy with her cell phone, and running up and down to tend to her babies, and to chat with me,  multi-tasking as women do. Later on, I joined her and did some paper work, so she came downstairs to get her paperwork too. Busy us! </p>
<p>After we had lunch, we sorted out a big stack of cards, getting the pairs together, one pair for each of us at a time. I had another stack of flash cards for numbers, and just for fun pulled those out, and how Mirei loved calling out those numbers to me ... "four plus nine!", "seven plus eight!" and she laughed so hard when she took a turn with me, and I made mistakes. She caught them immediately and gave me that look with her eyes to make sure I really was just teasing. </p>
<p>The Blue Angels were practicing for Fleet Week today and we were lucky enough to see them fly by twice in our big oval bedroom window. Mirei's response was like mine: "Wow!". I saw them in Toronto and never tire of seeing them streaking by, and Mirei didn't mind the noise, thank goodness.</p>
<p>Doug got home in mid-afternoon, so Mirei and I went off to the playground at the top of the hill for an hour and a bit. The sun was warm here, but it was cooler on the hill, though Mirei was happy wandering about, swinging in the swing as high as she has ever asked me to push her, going up and down the enclosed slide and taking great pleasure in not letting me take her photo(!), and playing with some other children, a few of whom were very nervous about the planes, and one child who cried. Mirei always looked up with interest as they were making shapes in the sky and that interested her very much. </p>
<p>I popped Mirei in the tub right away, as Doug and I were going off to a reading tonight, courtesy of a birthday gift for Doug (and I get to be his guest!). I made a "hamburger" stew tonight, one of Mom's recipes, and Mirei ate a huge portion of it. There were lots of veggies in it already, so there were no side dishes for her tonight. </p>
<p>As soon as dinner was over, Mirei printed the alphabet, something we try to do each day. For whatever reason, she decided it would be funny to write the tiniest little letters and I was astounded at how much control she has to do them and yet make them so very clearly too! She thought it was funny too, and grinned each time she did another. She also learned tonight that NO spells "No!", that OK spells "OK", and that HI spells "Hi". The first two are a joke, as I have four big plastic letters on the kitchen wall, and Mirei knows that OK is really OK, but it sure is fun asking her to spell three words and having her do it, with that little face glowing. </p>
<p>Doug had gone off to his T'ai Chi class and came home in time for a very quick bowl of the stew, and Bryn came in just before Doug and was busy eating when we left, after many many laughs between those two! How I love the interaction there. </p>
<p>Mirei was very excited about having her daddy home with her, and was very busy entertaining him with all she had done and seen today. She showed him how she could do the number cards, and he was very impressed with how fast she was! I found out later that he read the first two chapters of the Everyday Storybook to her, leaving us to read the third one tomorrow night. </p>
<p>Our reading/conversation with Nick Hornby and David Eggers was just fantastic. Both of them are very well spoken, entertaining, and friends to boot, so it was a casual fun informative two-way conversation. Doug thought it was the very best of all this particular series he has ever attended, and I certainly enjoyed it as well. </p>
<p>It was a lovely day, from morning 'til evening. I can't imagine my days without this dear little girl in them! Today she asked me why I loved her, and I told her because she was funny, she was kind, and she was thoughtful. Then she asked me to ask her why she loved me(!), and the answer was "because you are smart, you are funny, I like your clothes, and you are always nice." That's a great way to end my day, by remembering this sweet exchange. </p>
