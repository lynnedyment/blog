								<h2>Hallowe'en Was a Non-Event For Us This Year</h2>
								<p>I must be honest and admit that the hours from midnight last night until Doug was released from the hospital about 12:30 P.M. ... 21 hours after he went in, are mostly just a blur. Lots happened, and there were certainly interesting situations going on all around us too, but mostly we just waited while various doctors came and went. Doug's last nurse was a sweet Irish gal and she, along with all the other staff members, was just wonderful. One wonders how they can maintain their cool under such dire circumstances, but except for a little eye-rolling and exchanged glances, they do incredibly well with it all. </p>
<p>I checked to see if the car needed to be moved before 9 A.M. and then went home to wash, brush my teeth, and send out an email to everyone letting them know what was going on here. I also called Susan to let her know that unfortunately we would not be out trick-or-treating with them, as was the plan. I even had our costumes out ready to be ironed, our usual clown outfit for Doug and my witch costume. It's the first year we have missed being out with the children since they were old enough to go, so it was a letdown for sure. </p>
<p>At the end of his time there, Doug was finally assured that they were sure there was nothing to keep him in the hospital. They definitely ruled out stroke and heart-related problems, but want him to see his family doctor next week asap, for a baseline visit, and then a follow up CTA scan in two months on the self-healed carotid artery. </p>
<p>It was a lovely day when the nurse wheeled Doug out to the car. Doug was able to get up all the stairs at the house as there were handholds in all the spots he needed them. It was good to be home, and take a hot shower, but we were both tired out from not sleeping last night. So we had lunch, then I read and fell asleep, went upstairs to watch a taped show and fell asleep again. Doug just pretty well stayed on the sofa for most of the day and ... slept! </p>
<p>He was feeling very disoriented and wasn't able to read, or spend more than a few minutes on the computer. We tried watching a movie, and even had popcorn to eat, but Doug was seeing double so that didn't work either. </p>
<p>We hadn't bought candy to give out as we thought we would be wandering around Belvedere Street, so we turned out all the lights. The door bell didn't ring once and there didn't seem to be any children out on our street at all. No doubt more and more children are going to either private parties, or choosing streets where they don't have to climb 38 steps up to the doorbells! </p>
<p>At 10 o'clock we went up to bed, hoping we would manage to get a few solid hours sleep in a row, despite our too-many naps today! </p>
<p>p.s. The next day, Susan sent a photo of them all dressed up in their wonderful costumes! </p>
