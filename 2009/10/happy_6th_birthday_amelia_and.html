								<h2>Happy Sixth Birthday, Amelia! ... and Gingerbread Cookies, Too!</h2>
								<p>Amelia turned six today and we had made plans to go to "Jim's Restaurant", one of the local Mission Street "greasy spoons" that we have all been going to over the years. </p>
<p>Mirei had awakened at 7 this morning, which gave us lots of time for her to have the first part of her breakfast and to make a card for Amelia. She did a great job on it, working with her tongue sticking out as she concentrated on getting it done to her satisfaction. There were stickers involved as well as printing names, and pictures too, of Amelia, "baby Finn", Susan, and Kevin too. Bryn sat with her and made a colourful  "autumn princess birthday girl" crown for Amelia. </p>
<p>Since Doug was at his T'ai Chi class, Bryn skate-boarded to the restaurant, and Kevin drove over at 10 A.M. to pick up Mirei and me. Kevin got the biggest hug and a kiss from Mirei, who also told him with her big smile, "I like you Kevin!" She sure does, and always has. It was sweet to see them holding hands, crossing the street to the restaurant a few minutes later. </p>
<p>We met up with Susan and the children kitty-corner from where we parked and all the children hugged each other. Bryn was waiting for us, and in a few minutes we were sitting in our usual big horseshoe-shaped booth by the front window. Amelia looked darling in her crown, and Mirei and Amelia had a great time, just chatting away, and at one point putting lip gloss on each other! We had eggs and toast and hash browns, tea and coffee, juice, and presents too for Amelia to open. </p>
<p>I walked home on my own, for my own fresh air and exercise, and Bryn drove Mirei home in Kevin's car. </p>
<p>Mirei asked if we could "bake something", and there was just enough time for us to roll out a small portion of the gingerbread dough and bake cookies, before Susan, Kevin, and the children arrived. It was delightful watching Mirei roll out the dough, press the cutters into it carefully, pull the dough away from the cut areas, and lift them carefully onto the tray. She has had so much practice with Play-Doh that she knew just what to do. She even got to deliver a freshly baked cookie upstairs to her daddy, and one for Grandpa too. And of course she sat down with a glass of vanilla soy milk and a big cookie for herself.  </p>
<p>We finished up just before Susan and the family arrived. They were off to Vancouver this afternoon at 4 o'clock but dropped by at 1:20 with a delicious cheesecake and candles for Amelia to blow out. The children had a little playtime together, and then it was time for hugs and wave-goodbyes from the window, as Bryn drove them all to the airport for their eight-day trip away. </p>
<p>I had some tidying up to do in the kitchen, and took time for a quiet cup of tea too, while Mirei watched Caillou and "worked" with Bryn upstairs, where he was working. </p>
<p>Just before 4, I called up to see if Mirei wanted to go to the playground, and of course she did! It was fairly quiet when we got there, but more and more children came along, and then Oona and Karyn, our downstairs neighbours, came by. Oona is nine months older than Mirei, but over the summer has grown so tall, and has become quite daring too, jumping off the side of the slide! I just cannot imagine Mirei doing this next year, but I suppose there is a good chance she might. They had lots of fun together and with another little girl too, and we all left at 5 o'clock for home. </p>
<p>Mirei wanted her dinner first, so had a big bowl of stew, with custard and strawberries for dessert. Bryn sat with us too, eating some leftovers Susan had brought over, as he has dinner reservations for 10 P.M. with Mari tonight, after an 8 o'clock concert at the Brava Theatre in the Mission. The three of us had fun with the rubber alphabet and number puzzles while she ate. Mirei has them all down pat and we put them in backwards again tonight, just 'cause she can. </p>
<p>Tuck in time at 7:15 with another new story. Mirei now knows that there are seven stories for the seven days of the week, and tonight's story was called "Teddy's Sailboat", my least favourite of all of them, but still a very cute story with a turtle, a butterfly, and a frog all turning down offers from Teddy to sit on his toy sailboat. Finally his friend comes along with a little sailor doll and the story ends happily for all. </p>
<p>Our little one, smelling of coconut cream, which she loves to help me put on after her tub, was asleep at 7:35, Doug and I watched the final episode of our mini-series, and I got to start the sequel to the book I enjoyed so much when I was in Ontario: "Too Many Men". The sequel is called "You Gotta Have Balls", an expression that surely comes from the main character's father. </p>
