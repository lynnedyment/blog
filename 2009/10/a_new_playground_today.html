								<h2>A New Playground Today!</h2>
								<p>Mirei woke just before 7 A.M. again today, so this seems to be her official time for now. Having her asleep by 7:30 continues to be my goal, and it works out well for us. It gives me three and a half solid hours to catch up on emails and write my blog entry, and still have time for a short TV session with Doug if we have something on the go. </p>
<p>I do love waking up beside this girl, as she puts her face very close to mine, and whispers good morning to me, making sure that I am really awake. Then I hear "good morning, sweetheart" or "good morning, sweetie" before we start our now usual stretching routine. And Mirei has started anticipating Grandpa coming in and finding us too, something Riku enjoyed on his once-a-week sleepovers for a few years, right up to his visit here in August too. </p>
<p>Mirei ate a big breakfast today, and then went off for a car drive at 9 with her Dad to pick Mari up and drive her to work. Mari had forgotten her wallet in the car yesterday, and Bryn hoped to buy doughnuts at a place near her office. Mirei told me when they got home that the doughnut place was closed today. It is Columbus Day, and so some shops and the government are not working. </p>
<p>We spent the overcast morning here at home, with lots of activities taking place. Mirei painted, we read <strong>twelve</strong> books in the living room, Mirei recited off the words she knows how to spell and went over the letters of the alphabet in one book she especially likes. She told me she would like "melted cheese with bread" for lunch, a grilled cheese sandwich, so I suggested we go for a trike ride first and then have lunch. She said "that is a good idea. We need exercise and fresh air, right Nana?" She's with the program! </p>
<p>Today she peddled hard and fast right up to the mailbox and insisted on carrying her trike on her own across the road. I managed to get a video of her peddling home, but she ran out of steam a half block away. Doug and Bryn sat down and had grilled cheese sandwiches with her, and after lunch Doug, Mirei, and I headed off to a new spot Doug had found when he was volunteering at a radio station in September. McLaren Park is a huge acreage just on the outskirts of the city, and there are two playgrounds scattered about, tennis courts, a swimming pool, two small lakes, a creek, a marsh, a redwood grove, an amphitheatre, and lots of hiking trails. The property is both flat and hilly, so it's a perfect place for a family outing. There are lots of picnic tables scattered about as well, and I thought how much Riku would have enjoyed this spot. Next time ... </p>
<p>We went to the two playgrounds and Mirei certainly got her exercise in this afternoon. She has become very willing to try almost anything, and so climbed up sloping wide steps to the top of play structures, as well as flat ones, an off-balance tiered set of steps, and a swinging rope set too. She kept herself very busy running up and down, sliding down, and climbing up the slides. Now that she has learned how to do this, she is determined to try it on every new slide she sees, and today she found lots of new ones. </p>
<p>Mirei found flowers, blew out some dandelion seeds with Doug, patted a tiny puppy, who had very sharp tiny teeth(!), and she and Doug found some places on a bridge where they could step and make music. The sun never did come out today, but it wasn't cold, just cool, and perfect for Mirei running about. </p>
<p>Tub time as soon as we got home, followed by "those tiny little pastas again" with peas on the side. This girl loves her pasta and had it with pesto, another favourite flavour. Bryn was with us for dinner and he and Mirei shared lots of laughs at the table. He deliberately changes words so that they are silly, and Mirei instantly picks up on them, and laughs so hard while she corrects him. Then he pretends he didn't hear her correctly, comes out with another silly word or phrase, and sets her off again. I love her laugh and one can't help but laugh along with her. </p>
<p>We finished dinner nice and early tonight, and so there was time for Mirei to become a "bag lady" once more, a favourite pastime, packing herself up with her yellow lunch bag, her pink backpack and a flat Barbie container of paper and stickers, I believe. She has been doing this for a long time, and always reminds me of her cousin Caillie, who is also very fond of stuffing things in bags and carting them about. </p>
<p>There was even time for a second round of painting; she found a bag in the laundry room stuffed with new things to use when painting, and was very happy to sit down and do a second, and quite different painting tonight. This last one is a pastel, very different from her darker one this morning. She is very proud to have them hanging in the kitchen, next to the one that Riku did when he was here.  </p>
<p>Bryn told her if she did her bedtime routine very quickly tonight, that I would read her <strong>two</strong> stories, and she co-operated very well. So, we got to read about "Bingo, the Lost Teddy Bear" (my personal favourite) and also "Mumpsy Goes to Kindergarten" which may be Mirei's. It is a sweet story and I'm so glad she enjoyed them all, as that is the end of the book. She may want to hear them again, though, before she leaves at month's end. </p>
<p>I walked out of her room at 7:35 tonight, although she woke up crying at 9 with her legs both sore and itchy from some really nasty mosquito bites she had when she arrived. A few of them are infected, and even though they seemed to be healing and haven't bothered her, for some reason tonight they flared up. However, after I put some cream on them, she was back to sleep within minutes. Poor wee girl; she is not happy about those mosquitoes and I'm glad the cold weather means the end of them when she gets home again. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a forty-five minute recorded TV show again tonight, and then I got to work on the photos for today. Bedtime already, though; the time just flies by too quickly! </p>
