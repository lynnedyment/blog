								<h2>Cool, Foggy Day, and Two Playgrounds</h2>
								<p>Doug drove Bryn to the airport this morning about 6:40 or so. I heard a door shut, but Mirei was still sleeping soundly and I drifted back to sleep with her until 7:15. Bryn left us a note saying goodbye as we hadn't done so before he and Doug left for the concert last night. Mirei was very pleased to see her name and "Daddy" too, as she could read them herself, and took notice of the hugs and kisses too. </p>
<p>She made me laugh this morning, sitting at the table nibbling away on her requested breakfast "round bread with a hole in it and cheese please." Yup, a bagel with cream cheese coming up, and cut into quarters as requested. That, and the comics, kept her occupied for a full half hour, keeping Grandpa company. </p>
<p>After breakfast, Mirei got out two lots of Play-Doh and we decided we would make a pie and cookies for a party. We both rolled and patted and decorated, and made a wonderful tiny facsimile of a pie, with bottom crust, filled with tiny "cherries", a top crust with slashes added to that, and then Mirei trimmed the edges with a knife. Then I showed her how to crimp the dough and decided, after seeing how much she enjoyed it, that we really must make a cherry pie before she leaves. She could then make some tiny overworked jam tarts, just as I did as a little girl with my grandmother, and eat them all up! </p>
<p>Of course we sang the two baking songs we know as we worked ... "Can you bake a cherry pie, Billy Boy, Billy Boy?" was our first one, followed by "Five currant buns in a baker's shop." I must try to record her singing her few current songs as, like Riku, she sure does love to sing. Once in a while I will sing a particular one, and Mirei pipes up with "Oh! I bemember that one!" </p>
<p>Our intention was to go to Stow Lake today, but the day went from somewhat overcast to downright cloudy, and the temperature seemed to be dropping too. The power went off twice, and stayed off for quite a long time the second time. Mirei was quite intrigued with this, and didn't quite believe that the TV didn't work and she really couldn't watch "The Grinch". She sat upstairs reading while I showered, and then when I finished asked me to see if the lights were working. I was sure they wouldn't be, but she was right, and told me so, and we watched the rest of the movie she had started last night. </p>
<p>After lunch, knowing we had to get out before the weather got worse, she and I went off to a playground we don't often go to, down below the hill where we live. Mirei had actually requested that we go to "the playground with the moving steps", demonstrating with much hip waggling and feet shuffling just exactly what she meant. My intention was to go there, but we ended up going to two different ones instead. There were a few children at the first one, and Mirei generously shared her sand toys with two younger boys, both of whom were thrilled with the two trucks we still carry with us. We sat and had a little picnic snack there, but it was getting really cold and I was ready to leave after about an hour and a quarter. </p>
<p>We stopped in at a Whole Foods market at the bottom of our hill, specifically to buy broccoli spears, something our usual supplier hasn't had in lately, but Mirei spotted some avocados, so we bought 5 on sale for $5, and some tomatoes ("I don't like tomatoes, I only like tomato sauce on pizza and pasta"), and a special treat of a cookie with ice cream bar. </p>
<p>We were going to be passing our regular playground on the way home, and even though it looked as though it might rain at any moment, Mirei said she would like to stop and play for a little bit. There were quite a few children there, too, and at one point Mirei was sitting in the sandbox with two children, again younger than she. After a half hour, a few rain drops fell, and we came home. I don't think it ever did rain any more than that, though. </p>
<p>We immediately washed up and got our aprons on and made icing for the carrot cake. Mirei was right there helping me, mixing the butter and cream cheese together, tasting it, adding the icing sugar, tasting it, and finally adding the vanilla, and turning the bowl, ending with licking the spatula. She helped me spread the icing on the cake, too, and had another little lick at the end. </p>
<p>And then it was time for doing her alphabet, with Doug again, while I had a quick and hot cup of tea in the living room. This is something else I must tape, as it's quite cute to hear the two of them go through the letters and comment on them too.  </p>
<p>A nice long tub time followed, and then dinner at 5:40. I served Mirei some baked fish nuggets, which we also bought today, along with mashed sweet potato, and steamed broccoli. Mirei's comment? "This looks like a Japanese dinner." We had more set meals like this when she first arrived, but lately I have been serving more casserole-style dishes, such as homemade mac' and cheese, "hamburger" stew, Mexican casserole, potato omelette, and ravioli, always with the veggies on a side plate. Interesting how she notices these little things. </p>
<p>She is picking up on lots of my speech mannerisms and I'm sure Bryn is going to be very aware of them once they get home again. I laugh when I hear her saying, when she can't find her wallet, for instance — she loses it constantly(!) — "That's strange." I usually say "weird", actually, but knowing it bugs Bryn have been trying to use a different word. And of course he's right, it's never weird or strange that something has gone missing, but is where we last put it, but it feels so much better to think that the universe at large is somehow involved. </p>
<p>Mirei chose two books tonight from the bookcase in the living room. She took her time choosing, and then approached me with them saying "Oh, I never read these books before!" I'm sure she has but so long ago she has forgotten. I sent so many books to Japan with them when they moved, but there are still enough there to keep the children happy. Finn and I often sit and ready together too, so it makes sense not to give them all away. </p>
<p>Susan, Kevin, and the children arrived home tonight from Vancouver; Doug picked them up at 6:30. I am sorry they are coming home to such cold weather, as we had a few beautiful sunny days and of course a huge rainstorm too, but perhaps the weather will change. I'm still looking forward to a few beach days! </p>
<p>Off I go to bed. Finn may be visiting tomorrow morning, and I have a few things to do before he arrives.</p>
<p>p.s. Akane sent out a photo of Riku taken on this day, and I just had to add it to this entry too. Such a lovely photo of our too-far-away boy. </p>
