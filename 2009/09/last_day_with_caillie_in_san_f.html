								<h2>Last Day with Caillie in San Francisco ... For This Trip</h2>
								<p>This will be a short blog entry tonight, as Caillie and I are flying to Toronto tomorrow, leaving the house at 9:30. Except for a short trip out of the house earlier in the day, we spent the entire day indoors. This isn't what we usually do, but I have had zero time on my own in months to get caught up with things around the house, so that added on top of the packing and organizing meant no excursions today. </p>
<p>However, Caillie had one more thing on her list to do: a late breakfast at "Just For You". It has been a favourite brunch spot for both Caillie and Bryn for a few years now, and so off we went at 10:45 and had a grand meal ... an order of beignets, hot from the fryer, and liberally dusted with icing sugar. Even though Caillie seems to be grimacing in the photo, she's not at all ... I just caught her at an awkward moment, as she ate two of the three tender treats. Then came her order of buttermilk pancakes, although she couldn't finish them off and brought them home to eat for breakfast tomorrow. I had my usual there, too ... two eggs over medium, home fries, whole wheat homemade toast, and tea.</p>
<p>Then it was off to Noe Valley for my haircut. Bing was available immediately, thank goodness, and we had a nice chat while she cut my hair. Now she has met three of my grandchildren! Caillie went off on her own to the Noe Valley bakery, hoping to find a chocolate-covered coconut macaroon, but with no luck. However, she found a big chocolate cupcake that appealed to her, an eclair she thought she might enjoy, and a lemon tart for Bryn, which she insisted she could get home in one piece for him, despite my suggestion that I save her all that trouble, and just have it myself with my tea. We shall see who was right tomorrow night! </p>
<p>And then it was home. Nothing too exciting followed ... laundry, loads of emails, while Caillie did some crafts, wrote in her journal, called her best friend in Toronto for a long chat, a few chats with Kelly for both of us, tidying and organizing for me, changing the bedding, clearing my desk top of dozens of photos for my blog entries, etc., etc. The time flew by, and as always, I wish I had "just one more day" for all of this!  </p>
<p>Caillie likes to play with my camera. She can tell me how to do things I had no idea about, such as putting up a photo on my screen that shows up when I open the camera. And how to change the colours, and the clarity, and so many other bits of information that I didn't have a clue about. She just clicks away, doing all sorts of crazy stuff, and today she took photos of herself, and some truly awful ones of me (thank goodness I know how to delete photos myself!), so that kept her busy for a while. The first photo is a self-portrait she did, and I like it that she has my camera in hand. </p>
<p>Doug went off to his T'ai Chi class and made two stops for us on the way home ... to Rainbow Groceries to pick up sourdough bread for the children in Toronto, and to Taqueria Can-CÃºn to pick up burritos for him and Caillie, a last burrito for Caillie until next March, when the whole family will be here for spring break. The way this year has raced by, this will be happening in no time flat! </p>
<p>Bed at 10:30 tonight, just to give myself a good night's sleep <strong>and</strong> an early start tomorrow. </p>
<p>p.s. By the way, all this food that Caillie ate was spread out over the course of the day. She actually has very good eating habits, with lots of fruit and healthy food in her diet! </p>
