								<h2>Central PEI: From Sunnyside, to Anne of Green Gables Country, to Charlottetown, and "Home"</h2>
								<p>Doug woke me this morning at 7:30 to get started on our day, a sunny one! We had some fruit in our room, and Doug added one of his fruit scones to his meal. And we were off for a road tour of the central part of this beautiful island. </p>
<p>We headed due east today, with me snapping photos left, right, and centre, often from the car windows, as the lush green well-tended plots of land just amaze me. All the fields seem to be unplanted as yet, despite lovely warm days; the soil is so red, and there isn't a rock in sight.We were constantly astounded at what perfect lawns people maintain here; weeds are obviously just not allowed. </p>
<p>Everyone seems to have a huge parcel of land, even when the homes are quite modest, but for the most part the homes are really big, wooden or aluminum siding, and always well maintained.It was picture perfect all the way up to the northern coast, where we drove as close to the water as the road took us. </p>
<p>We would have liked to take a peek at Lucy Montgomery's home (aka Anne of Green Gables home), but we weren't interested in going on the tour, and so we will wait until the next time we visit there — we hope to do so! — and walk around the grounds after closing time as one of the couples from the motel suggested yesterday. Instead we drove through a Provincial Park, and unknowingly drove close by the spot where Sandy and her family have rented a cottage for many years. </p>
<p>North Rustico is a very pretty town with a harbour, and we parked the car and went for a walk along the boardwalk; there were sculptures with explanations about the ancient Indian tribes who lived there over 3,000 years ago, as well as sea life and bird sculptures. We took lots of photos of the picturesque wooden sheds beside the harbour and meandered about looking at the boats. </p>
<p>Sandy had told us about one of her favourite places to eat, so we headed south for the PEI Preserve Company for lunch at their "Cafe on the Clyde". It was a busy spot, but we were lucky enough to get a window seat beside the red-coloured Clyde River. Doug had a PEI lobster quiche with a garden salad, and I had Maritime fish cakes (haddock, onions, and potatoes) with a Caesar salad. Sandy had suggested that we save room for the raspberry cream cheese pie, which we did, and I enjoyed a full pot of tea with it too. Yum! </p>
<p>We headed for Charlottetown after taking some photos outside the restaurant in their lovely garden, but stopped first at the Cow Creamery, a huge, local (to the Martimes), and very busy ice cream shop. Reader's Digest voted them as having the best ice cream in Canada. I was too full for a scoop, but had a taste of Doug's. From there we drove down to the harbour area of Charlottetown and walked around snapping a few photos of the older wooden homes there, and peeking into a few of the touristy shops.</p>
<p>We drove home slowly, stopping to take a few scenic photos, including some of an old Canoe Cove school built in 1830.</p>
<p>I think Sandy had told us there was a good spot for lobster rolls in Summerside called "Sharky's"; we had passed by it on our way out of town this morning, so that was our dinner destination tonight. We arrived at 6:30, and it was a good thing, since they close up at 7 P.M., as most places do in this area! We were astounded at this, but it wasn't at all busy, and we were the last customers in the place. I had fish and chips, better than the ones at Eva's last night, and Doug thoroughly enjoyed his very generously filled lobster roll. </p>
<p>Home for emails, reading, and relaxing. </p>
