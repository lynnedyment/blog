								<h2>The Gardening Crew Arrives!</h2>
								<p>My garden has been sorely neglected for too long. There was a time, a <strong>long</strong> time ago, when it was quite pristine with newly planted annuals, carefully watered all through the summer, and nary a weed in sight. Once the grandchildren arrived, it was fun and easy to go out and weed while they played, found bugs, "helped" me sweep, and move the debris about. Eventually, though, the more diligent gardening was replaced with playgrounds and adventures away from the house. So, over the past couple of years especially, it has just been swept up, kept somewhat tidy, and as a result, slowly but surely, the more persistent weeds took over. </p>
<p>Susan loves to garden, and over the years has come by and spent full mornings out there with the children and me tidying it up. Once I was back from Japan in May with my "bad" back, and unable to do a thing out there — no bending, no stretching, no leaning, made it impossible to get at the three-foot(!) weeds in one area — Susan took it upon herself to get it back in order. It really was a jungle out there, after six weeks in Japan, and busy rainy wintry months before that. </p>
<p>Susan knew how much it bothered me to see it in such tough shape. So, not only did she do a lot of clipping and weed pulling when I first got home, planting flower pots for me at the front of the house, she also came over with Finn while I was in PEI to add to the flower pots, and do some more work with Finn. How did I get so lucky? </p>
<p>Today I suggested she drop both children off in the morning with me, and head out for some quiet and alone time, but instead she thought it would be fun to garden with us. My back is now almost back to normal, and so the four of us spent over an hour and a half sweeping, breaking branches to fit into the city composting bucket, and weeding and clipping. Susan did the back-breaking pulling of the thickest weeds and clipping off the tough branches, but the children kept at it the entire time with us too. They have their own gardening gloves here, and Amelia was thrilled to be allowed to use the adult snippers. Finn was not pleased about his safety children's scissors but he resigned himself to his fate. Now I have a full composting container, well compressed, after Doug stood in it, tromping it all down, and there is another huge mound waiting for next week's pick-up.  </p>
<p>And, as if this weren't enough, Susan insisted on bringing lunch in for us! The children and I went upstairs and played until Susan called us down for big yummy sandwiches, and a box full of the most wonderful desserts: a perfect lemon slice, the chewiest, most luscious brownies, and some blondies too, yet to be savoured. What a perfect three hours this was! Thank you Susan! </p>
