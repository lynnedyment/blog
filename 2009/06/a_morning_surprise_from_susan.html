								<h2>Finn and a Gardener Arrive!</h2>
								<p>I had asked Susan on Monday if Finn could visit again today, and called this morning to make sure he would be here. The answer was "yes", but Susan said she would be here too, to plant my flower pots at the front of the house! They were in a dreadful state, with completely dead flowers in one pot, weeds poking out from around a geranium in another, and a couple of empty pots as well. What a gal! I was delighted, and handed over the basket of gardening tools to her. </p>
<p>It's a gorgeous sunny warm day today, and Finn wanted to go into the garden with me. So, off we went, brooms in hand, and worked away. If I swept the deck, then so did Finn. When I moved on to the brick patio, Finn was right beside me. And when I reached up to the windows to knock down the dried up spider webs, Finn tried his best to do the same. We got a lot done, the two of us! </p>
<p>Miraculously, it seemed to me, I woke this morning with no pain, and no need to eat immediately so that I could take a Motrin! I didn't do any bending, but Finn was happy to pick up the big sticks to put in the city compost bin, and to try to pull some weeds too. Susan, finished at the front, and pulled a few weeds in the garden, before coming into the house with Finn. I had made him a poached egg and toast, but he wasn't interested in anything but the grapes and strawberries we popped into him. </p>
<p>He had discovered the big noisy Tonka truck today, and sat figuring out how all the bits work. "What this do?", over and over he asked, as there were lots of buttons! It's a noisy machine, and Amelia didn't like it one bit, always covering her ears when Riku was playing with it. But the noise doesn't bother Finn at all. He was reluctant to leave, so I told him he could take it home with him. This pleased him no end! </p>
<p>I admired my newly-filled flower pots and promised Susan I would pick up the extra few I need to fill them in. Finn turned back on their way to their car and said something to me ... Susan said he had said "I love you Nana." Music to my ears! I love him too, and stood waving goodbye as they drove by the house. </p>
