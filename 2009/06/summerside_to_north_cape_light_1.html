								<h2>Summerside to North Cape Lighthouse and Return</h2>
								<p>I woke at 9 A.M. today (!) to the sound of Doug showering; what a good long deep sleep I had! The motel owners serve a continental breakfast in their lounge during off season and today is the last day for it. We were hungry, and ready to get started on our tour of the island, so I popped in and out of shower as quickly as possible, and we headed off in the drizzle for a bite to eat. We were so glad we did, as we met a lovely couple from Edmonton, and a gal from Kelowna, and sat chatting as we ate yogurt and delicious muffins, with juice and/or tea. No one was in a big rush, since the rain got heavier, so there was time to listen to what the others had done and seen and recommended. </p>
<p>By 11 A.M. we were out the door, with our eventual goal being the North Cape lighthouse at the northwestern end of this piece of the island. We didn't get far before stopping though! Our motto when in small towns is "never pass up a new bakery", and there was one about a three-minute drive from the motel. We were somewhat disappointed in this first one, though, as there was nothing especially enticing to me, although Doug found some fruit scones that he will eat for breakfast and afternoon snacks when he is peckish. </p>
<p>We got back in the car, heading up the western portion of the island, following the North Cape Coastal Drive. There were decorated road signs that pointed the way for us, but we found them very confusing. At one point, we ended up too far east, and headed back to the road we should have stayed on. But we got lost a second time, and turned around when we hit the very end of a road that turned to dirt, ending at Egmont Bay, not where we wanted to be! Back on the main road once more, we figured out where we were going wrong.</p>
<p>So, here's the deal. Yes, they post signs, lovely colourful signs, telling you your turn is coming up. Then that's it! They don't have a sign at the actual turning point, and we found out that what we were expected to do was quickly look down the roads to our right or left to see if we could spot the continuation sign! Sometimes it would be the first road, just yards ahead, but other times it's a couple of roads down. It's sort of like a treasure hunt, and we felt pretty darned good after that, having figured out how the game worked. </p>
<p>It was raining gently, and then less gently as we drove on, but it was fun passing signs along the way for Alaska, Brooklyn, and Norway, all place names here. Sandy had told us about a good spot for lunch along that road, and it was easy to spot the big sign at the "G & E" restaurant in Unionvale. The place was huge, almost empty, and dark, and obviously a spot the locals like, as there was one table full of people the waitress seemed to know. Doug had his very first lobster roll, something he was looking forward to, and I had a grilled cheese sandwich with pickles. </p>
<p>Our next stop was at O'Leary, home of the Potato Museum, Interpretive Centre, and Community Museum, all rolled into one. We enjoyed it so much more than we thought we would. It is very well put together, with lots of photos and documentation for all the facts. Something we didn't know was that Russians grow the most potatoes in the world (but not for french fries!), China is next, with half that amount, and Canada is last on the list! Even the Brits grow more potatoes that we do. </p>
<p>There was a room full of period furniture, which I especially enjoyed. I took my time wandering about, looking at the old baby buggies, cribs, antique quilts, china, beds, chairs, etc. and even found the name of a Dyment — Curtis, out of Springfield — in a book of local boys who had served in WWI. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Doug was exploring and spent a lot of time checking out the first iron lung he has ever seen. At one point the local doctor had owned one, and a replica of his office had been constructed there as well. </p>
<p>A few years ago, through my Ancestry website, a PEI Dyment had contacted me via email to see if Doug was from that same family of two brothers who left Somerset, England, in 1833, bound for Canada. Doug's ancestor, John, and his wife Mary, went to Dundas in Ontario, and his brother Humphrey, with his wife Elizabeth, left to farm in PEI. A week before we left on this trip, I emailed Bayfield Dyment, and told him we would be in the area. He kindly wrote back, suggesting we meet, and since he works at the Home Hardware store in O'Leary, we decided to connect there on our first day. </p>
<p>He was gracious and very friendly, and we stood in the back room chatting with him for a while. Curtis Dyment, the fellow named in the museum book, was his grandfather, and served in both world wars. We planned to get together again later in the week. </p>
<p>From O'Leary we headed northwest up Hwy. 2. It was just pouring by that time, and the windshield wipers were having a hard time keeping up with the it all. However, the island is green, green, green, and so very beautiful. I wanted to take photos but it was just too wet, so we just had to admire what we could from the windows of the car. The red soil, ready for planting, is such a contrast from the green fields, and it all looked just grand ... all countryside, with tiny little villages along the way. There are only two cities in PEI — Charlottetown, and Summerside — and Doug feels that the latter should probably be called a large town. </p>
<p>We arrived at North Cape lighthouse in a downpour! There were a couple of tall white wind generators off the side of the road as we drove up to it, and they looked quite ghostly in the heavy fog. We couldn't even walk along the short path to the lighthouse as we would have been drenched, and muddy to boot! We stopped in at the information building, alone with just one clerk, and after Doug managed to snap a couple of photos, from the protection of the porch, we headed home again. </p>
<p>We didn't loiter on the way home, but headed right into Summerside for dinner at "Eva's", a spot recommended to us by the owner of the motel. We lucked out, as it was Friday night and they had a fish and chip special on. The menu was quite limited for me, but the fish (haddock) was delicious, if heavily battered, while Doug chose scallops and chips. We also had a choice of soup, juice, or rainbow cake with it. Doug had a bowl of seafood chowder, which he quite enjoyed, and I had tomato juice. </p>
<p>We stopped at the nearby grocery store for grapes and bananas, but had to carefully dodge the deep puddles. The lone clerk called out "You made it!" to everyone entering the store. Some of the nearby streets at the lower end of town, were flooded with inches of water.</p>
<p>Happy to be back in our cozy room, we were all set for some computer time, but there were problems with software updates being downloaded, and that didn't get finished up until after 11 P.M., bedtime for both of us. We're hoping for a dry day tomorrow!  </p>
