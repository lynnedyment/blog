								<h2>Monday Morning with Finn ... and Tulips Plus</h2>
								<p>It has been a long time since Finn was here with me, more than two months! I was looking forward to having him putter about the house again, and Susan was happy to go off for groceries and run errands while he played at Nana and Grandpa's house. He came in wearing a Toronto Maple Leafs zip-up jacket, which he refused to take off, and the cutest little flattish driving cap with a brim, looking quite Irish to me. I must get a photo of him in it! </p>
<p>Finn has a little cold and is jet-lagged, and since it was foggy and chilly outside, we spent all of the two-plus hours in the house today, rare for us. But, Finn was very happy wandering about. There were baskets of toys to empty, dolls to walk in their stroller, balls to roll, dishes to empty onto the floor from the little play stove, drawers to empty of their plastic utensils, push toys to push, sweeping to be done, and more quiet time sitting on the floor in the small bedroom, playing with the basket full of cars. </p>
<p>I was in the kitchen while he was in there, and every once in a while he would call out to me "Nana, I am in here!" and I would thank him for telling me. I went in at one point to ask him if he would like porridge; he merely nodded his head, engrossed with the cars. Then I asked if he wanted strawberries in it, and he nodded again. So, I asked if he would like blueberries too, and he shook his head no. Doug put him in his seat at the table for me, and he ate every single bite of it! </p>
<p>Finn is asking lots of questions ... "What this do?", "What this for?" He is speaking so well and repeats anything I don't catch for me until I do understand. We sang too, with Raffi on in the background. Finn likes to dance, and once in a while stops to move to the beat. Adorable! </p>
<p>Susan came in, bearing, as always, some wonderful treats: fresh hot tamales, and Belgian chocolate pudding, one of Doug's favourite desserts of late! Susan had given us some before they left for Toronto and Doug was one happy camper. He mentioned to her how much he liked it, Susan remembered, of course, and now there is a whole tub of it for us to share. Yum! And there was a lovely bouquet of bright yellow tulips for me too. </p>
<p>Finn waved from the car window, after a nice little kiss goodbye. </p>
