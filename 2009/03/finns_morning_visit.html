								<h2>Finn's Morning Visit</h2>
								<p>The doorbell rang just after 9:30 and Finn was in Susan's arms, smiling, and immediately asked for "Grandpa?". Doug was showering, but it didn't take long for him to get busy once we had waved to Susan from the living room window. </p>
<p>I had such a fun time with him; he wanted to go outside when he first arrived so we were in the garden for an hour while we swept, I pulled weeds, and he helped put all the long branches into the compost container. Such a big helper! </p>
<p>He also rode and pushed the various toys around the back yard, grunting as he lifted them up and over into the patio area, and then doing it all over again when it was time for the next one. It got a little chilly, so we came in, I filled up the sink with warm water, and lots of plastic dishes and a sail boat, and he had a grand ol' time, especially loving the faucet with the spray on it. </p>
<p>Then he moved on to the noisemakers, a huge hit right now, as he "asks" me to open the door to the laundry room, and hauls out the container that holds them all. He likes to spread them all out, and blow, and shake, and bang away at each and every one of them. </p>
<p>For his early lunch, I made him a big bowl of porridge with blueberries and he ate it down so quickly. I think he was anxious to get back to playing! He happily pulled all of the plastic cutlery out of the little kitchen set, moved on to the computer with the program that makes great sounds when he punches the keys, and finally pulled out some cars and trucks which kept him busy until Susan arrived. We even managed to read two stories on the sofa before Susan came for him at noon.</p>
<p>Susan never comes back empty handed, and today she came with four bunches of tightly closed yellow daffodils for me, and two packages of my veggie "bacon". Later on Susan wrote to say that Finn had slept soundly on the way home, so all the fresh air and busy morning helped with that, I like to think! </p>
<p>I spent the afternoon posting items on freecycle that I want out of my house. I was <strong>very</strong> successful and had twelve items ready at the front door for pick up over the next three days. How I enjoy clearing out the clutter, and it's even better when someone else is so thankful for having it all! </p>
