								<h2>Finally, a Gorgeous Ocean Beach Day, and a Reunion for Riku</h2>
								<p>Even though we have been to Linda Mar beach twice, and Riku and I had made an attempt for a picnic at Ocean Beach a couple of weeks ago, we just have not had that perfect day there we all love so much. After our very hot day yesterday, and night too(!) â€” very unusual here, I had a feeling today was the day. And it was! Caillie and Riku watched a bit of Cinderella this morning, while eating part of their breakfast in front of the TV, and I packed up our lunches and snacks for our day. </p>
<p>Amelia was home from school, not feeling well, so we made arrangements to meet there. Traffic was slow, I had to stop for gas, there was construction after that to wind through, but finally there we were! It was just the perfect day, with lots of sun, cooler air at the water, and no wind, always the big hurdle with this beach. Caillie lay on the blanket on her own, while Susan, Finn, Riku, Amelia, and I wandered down the beach. Amelia had a nice big bucket full of shells already, and she helped Riku add to his bucket. Finn meandered along as well, enjoying himself, and we headed back to the central part of the beach after Susan stepped on a bee, and got badly stung. </p>
<p>We had our lunch, after which Caillie joined the children down at the water's edge. Susan had brought along a couple of water guns, so they were in use, although when they are filled from the edge of the water, they are also filled with sand. Caillie got really soaked, but was a very good sport about it, even if she was the favourite target. I took lots of photos, of course, as beach photos with the children are among my favourites. </p>
<p>Susan, Amelia, and Finn went back to the far end of the beach for a walk and exploration, giving Caillie and Riku some time alone in the water ... and for more photos of the two of them. We're down to our last day with Riku. </p>
<p>We got home just in time to have a quick drink, splash our faces, and go off to Starr King, (Riku's school here until this past March), to meet up with teachers and former classmates. Caillie stayed home on her own to shower off the salt water. </p>
<p>Doug dropped Riku and me off at the school, and he had such a lovely reunion. We first went to see his grade one teacher, Ms. Tong, and happily gave her as big a hug as he got from her, along with her lovely big smile.</p>
<p>Leaving her to getting her class ready for dismissal, we walked down the hall and spotted some of the children from his class last year, now in grade two. The teacher didn't know Riku, but had been told by the principal that we would be stopping in. His old classmates gathered 'round him, giving him hugs, holding his hands, and asking him lots of questions.</p>
<p>As we were walking down the opposite end of the hall, on our way outside, I noticed some other classmates, with a new teacher as well, and even though Riku was a little shy about going back to stand in the door of that room, he did, and got another chorus of "Hi Riku!". I am sorry I didn't get photos of these children too, but the teacher didn't seem quite so user-friendly. </p>
<p>Some parents of these former classmates spotted us as we walked downstairs to the courtyard, and stopped to say hello to Riku too, patting him on the head, and asking a few questions. Riku is quite shy about these situations until they are underway, and then he is just fine with it all and happy.</p>
<p>Outside we spotted Ms. To, his kindergarten teacher coming out with her class, and Riku went running up to her with no hesitation at all. She was obviously just as pleased to see him and enveloped him in a huge hug, and a big smile.</p>
<p>Once the children had been collected by their parents, Ms. Chang, his English teacher in kindergarten, came running up to embrace him in a, yes, big hug!  At one point all three teachers were there, asking him lots of questions, patting him, hugging him again, and all of them told him how much they missed him, and how tall he was! It was adorable, and it was just great that he was here in the city just as school was back in session, to see these familiar faces.</p>
<p>Riku and I walked home down our familiar route. He stopped to give "his" little round tree a hug, and to comment that it needed some water. Then we walked down the 132 steps we had walked down so many times before, holding hands and counting as we we did so. It was so hot, and it seemed a perfect time for Caillie and him to finish watching their movie, with the fan blowing on them, while I got dinner ready. </p>
<p>About three weeks ago, Riku had asked if we could have "that dinner where you put the bread in the hot cheese on a stick" ... cheese fondue! I had no memory of Riku enjoying it so much; we always have it on Christmas Day, so he had tucked that away in his mind until now. So, we decided we would have it the last night of his stay here, with Caillie. Bryn was joining us as well, so it was perfect. Caillie said she wasn't crazy about it, but would try again (Kelly and Gregg now serve it on Christmas Eve or up in the Manitoulin sometime during their stay there). She liked it and had it for dinner, instead of something else, so I was very pleased about this. It really is a family traditional meal for us. </p>
<p>The evening was our usual one, with Riku tubbed first, then time with Caillie, on the computer tonight with the drawing program, and then two books before tuck-in at 8 P.M.. Doug and Bryn had gone off to a movie, Caillie and I had two games of cards with our tea, and then had some quiet time on our own for the last bit of the evening. </p>
