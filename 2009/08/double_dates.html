								<h2>Double Playdates</h2>
								<p>Riku had double playdates today, and he enjoyed both so much. We were out the door at 9:45, waiting in the car, so that we could follow Susan, Amelia, and Finn to the Coyote Point Museum, just past the airport. The house was very cool, with the fog hanging low over the city, but not long after the children started running around outside, off came their jackets. </p>
<p>The museum is just a wonderful spot for children, and grown-ups too. We started in the "discovery lab", a huge hit with the children, as there were lots of hands-on exhibits that kept them all busy for the longest time. There is an aviary, where we were about three feet from a very brave blue heron. The docent showed the children where other birds were as well, not so out in the open as the heron. The wildlife habitat was a hit too, with indoor and outdoor habitats containing dozens of native creatures that can't be released into the wild for one reason or another. We saw rattlesnakes, a badger ... much larger than I expected it to be(!), frogs, a porcupine, and river otters. We didn't see the coyotes today, but shall on our next trip. Upstairs was a beautiful area, called the environmental hall, with peek-a-boo windows, a place to make clay creatures, lots of informational panels, interesting enough that Amelia and Riku kept calling to each other to show what they had discovered. </p>
<p>We could have stayed on longer, exploring, but the children were hungry and so off we went to find a shady picnic area. Susan had brought along a yummy sandwich for me, and chips for all of us. Riku had his first cucumber and cream cheese sandwich, and even though he didn't think he was going to like it, he ate every bite. I packed along lots of fruit too, and the minute the children finished, they found a fabulous tree to climb. Amelia was the first one up, and after watching for a few minutes Riku clambered after her. It was the first time I had seen him climb a tree, and on the way home he confirmed that by saying "I climbed my very first tree today!" Finn tried, too, and no doubt by next year he'll be sitting beside his sister. </p>
<p>The nearby playground was great, and we spent about an hour there, so the children had plenty of running-around time. We heard there has been a second, and much larger, playground built on the grounds, so the next time we will find that one. As we were heading for the picnic tables, Riku said he would like to go back as we didn't see it all, or spend as much time on some things, and I have promised that we will go with Caillie. We didn't get to the beach or the hiking trails either. As Susan and the children were in the store, Riku rushed me upstairs and pointed out a wooded area that he wants to see the next time too. It was fun to have a new spot to explore, and thanks to Susan we had a great time doing so. </p>
<p>This morning, before leaving, I confirmed that Riku could have a playdate with Sophie, one of the children from his preschool "Little Angels". He and Sophie haven't spent much time together but get along well. She and her parents stayed at Akane's and Bryn's for two days this summer, and so the children had one long afternoon together then too. So, Susan led the way to that part of town and I dropped Riku off at 1:45. He and Sophie rang the doorbell here at 5:15, so he had a nice long playtime with her, too. </p>
<p>I ran the tub immediately, and got Riku's dinner on the table while he relaxed and played in the bath. Since he seems to be awaking just before 6:30 each morning I have decided he can use an extra half hour sleep, so tonight he was asleep at 7:30. Shall see how this goes; with the busy days ahead with Caillie, though, it will likely work out just fine. </p>
