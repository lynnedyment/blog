								<h2>Water,  , Scooters, Carrots, and ... Caillie Arrives!</h2>
								<p>Riku had a new swimming instructor today, and he had such a fun and successful lesson. He always enjoys it, but today he was really looking forward to his time in the water. She had him do so much swimming, albeit with his water wings on, but he was more confident than I had seen him, and kept telling her to move further back, and still further. He also put his head right under the water for the first time, and swam across the pool dipping his head down, and then up, over and over again. He was so excited when he finished and so was I! </p>
<p>We were on our own today, and drove right to Susan's for a playdate with the children. They played in the house for a bit, and then we headed out with Finn on his tricycle (with a long handle, pushed by Susan), Amelia on her bicycle, with <strong>no</strong> training wheels!. and Riku trying out a scooter for the first time. Once Susan told him it was easier if his pushing foot stayed close to the foot on the board, he actually got his feet both off the ground a few times. </p>
<p>We walked/rode over to a playground I haven't been to before. All the children did lots of running around and climbing, before we made our way down a winding path to a lovely little garden area with butterflies and lots of flowers. Riku sat on a hay bale at one point, being a storyteller, which was fun to hear. I wish I had thought to record it! </p>
<p>Susan treated to ice cream on the way home. Riku always says he is not "a big fan of ice cream" but he ate about half of his chocolate cookie crumb cone before handing it over to me. Before saying goodbye, we went into the tiny back yard at Susan's, and the children picked some tiny tiny carrots. Riku was over the moon with permission to take a dozen of them with us. </p>
<p> We were home about 4:30, and he immediately went into the bathroom, filled the sink with water, put out a clean facecloth beside the sink, and washed and nipped the ends off. He suggested we have them for dinner, which we did. </p>
<p>We were in time to hear from Doug that Caillie was an hour late leaving Toronto, due to the worst storm Kelly can ever remember! Later we learned that a tornado had touched down in a couple of places near Toronto, so we were lucky that Caillie was able to get out when she did. </p>
<p>Riku and I had the evening at home together, as Doug was at his class and Bryn was over with Kevin for dinner and bedtime, while Susan went out to a movie and dinner with friends, a rare event these days.</p>
<p>It wasn't a quiet evening, though, as Riku had me laughing so hard, and I had him laughing too. He was in just such a funny mood ... singing a Japanese song, but just one line, loudly and with a very <strong>deep</strong> voice, and then trying to teach it to me, funnier still! </p>
<p>Our dinner was a long leisurely one, thanks to all the fun we were having, and I got rave reviews about the breaded fish, the sweet potatoes, and of course his lightly steamed carrots, which he pronounced "delicious"! </p>
<p>We added another "room" to our house in heaven, one filled with dogs and cats, all friendly. I'm sure this topic won't continue for long, but he certainly is thinking about it a lot right now, and it's fun to see what new things he comes up with. He phoned Bryn to say goodnight to him, and was enthusiastic and described his day in such glowing terms: riding the scooter, doing so well at his swimming class, and of course anticipating Caillie's visit tomorrow. And Bryn got to hear about the fish he had enjoyed, and how he would like to have that on his birthday too one day.</p>
<p>I had hoped to have him asleep at 7:30, as I have a feeling he will be up bright and early tomorrow, and Riku really rushed through his nightly routine ... teeth, bathroom, pulling down his duvet, and arranging the pillows so that we were at least in bed at that time. He was telling me to "be quick, Nana; we can do it. I know we can!" and then was happily sitting in the middle of his bed just as the hand on the clock reached that six on the bottom! We finished up the poems in the new Shel Silverstein book, which also pleased him, and he was asleep at 7:55. </p>
<p>I was pretty tired, from the fresh air and exercise I guess, so sat and read for a bit, and then filled in the time before picking Caillie up by adding some photos to the family tree on Doug's side from a fellow who has added them to his site. </p>
<p>I went to the airport for Caillie, leaving at 10:20 for her 10:45 arrival time, but had to wait a half hour before she came from a different direction than usual with a United gal who brought her to me. That first sight of her was astounding as she is taller than I am now! Later Kelly told me to take a look at the size of her shoes ... size 10! Kelly is sure she is going to be taller than her before long. </p>
<p>She is just lovely and looked perky and cheerful with her big smile and warm hug. She chatted all the way home about the friendly woman she met on the plane, about being hungry in Chicago, during her hour and a half wait there, but being told she would get something to eat on her next flight, which of course she did not ... and lots of other details ... the movie she sort of watched, how many chapters she read in her book, etc.  </p>
<p>So, she got ready for bed, I made her toast with cheese, and off she went to sleep. </p>
<p>It was 1 P.M. when I turned out my light ... where the time went, I have no idea but I did read longer than usual, for some reason. Lovely to go to bed with two of my grandchildren here! </p>
