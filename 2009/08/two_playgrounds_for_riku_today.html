								<h2>Two Playgrounds for Riku Today</h2>
								<p>Riku and I have an understanding ... that if he wakens before 7 A.M. he will stay in his bed downstairs until that time, and then he's allowed to come up to waken me. He usually just crawls into bed with me, and I waken before he says a word. He's been great about doing this since he arrived. I have a monitor set up, though, as often I am awake by 6:30 and when I hear him moving about in his room, I come downstairs to snuggle and read with him. This morning though he came up at 6:30! I was very surprised and he whispered to me that <strong>his</strong> read 7 o'clock. Hmmm. Odd. Less than ten minutes later though, as we lay quietly not talking, he again whispered to me that he had actually moved the hands of the clock himself, and that he was sorry he did that, and that he wouldn't do it ever again. I was so proud of him for 'fessing up, and told him so. Tonight at tuck-in time he told me he would see me at 7 o'clock tomorrow morning. </p>
<p>We had so hoped for a late morning and long afternoon at Ocean Beach today, but that fog was so thick this morning we couldn't see the tiniest hint of Sutro Tower. The fog wasn't moving either, so we decided to go to the playground on the hill again, just to get out this morning, hoping that one of his old school friends was there. No such luck, but the playground was filled with mostly babies and on to perhaps five-year-olds. He and I played a little bit of badminton, but for the most part Riku played with all the little ones. </p>
<p>One very young boy took a real shine to Riku and wanted to play badminton with him, so Riku spent the longest time with him, showing him how to try to hit the ball. At one point he was surrounded by five or six children, all waiting for a turn. </p>
<p>During the time we were there, two moms came up to me at separate times to tell me how patient and gentle Riku was with their children. He truly is, and it seems to come naturally to him too, this bond he has with them. And one of the dads there played with Riku and a few of the other children too, chasing them and making them all squeal. Riku didn't want the morning to end. </p>
<p>After a later than usual lunch at home (Riku snacked on fruit and cheese and crackers at the playground), we were off to join Susan, Amelia, and Finn at the "blue" playground at Golden Gate Park. Parking was just terrible and we had to drive for quite a bit before we lucked out with someone leaving. </p>
<p>The children all had a great time on the play structure for a long time, then played hide and seek in the "forest" area, and spent a lot of time with a fabulous "rocket launcher" that Susan had with her. It was so much fun that soon there was a whole collection of boys wanting to take turns too. Amelia and Riku gave up waiting so long for their turn again and went back to climbing. </p>
<p>Finn is just a remarkably capable little climber. Like Amelia, he has no fear at all, and like her is careful too, but I was still astounded at just how dexterous he is, and how he is able to figure out for himself how to get over and/or around any situation on the tall structure they were playing on. </p>
<p>Amelia proudly showed me how she can swing across the monkey bars, skipping every other one of them! She is amazing too, and has been from the time she was such a little girl. Her hands were sore from having done this over and over again today. </p>
<p>It was still foggy, although that playground is quite protected, as we found out when we moved through a tunnel to the music concourse for the children to sit and have their snacks. I was too cold almost instantly, but Amelia, looking just as cute as can be with a new haircut (with bangs!), and Riku were very happy to just run around with Finn until it was time to leave. </p>
<p>Riku still had his rash this morning, and even though the itching seems to have pretty much stopped, the rash itself has spread. It's a strange rash, as on his arms it is quite red and fine, covering them, and yet this morning he had actual individual bumps on the fronts and backs of his legs. Tonight there were some on his feet, and later tonight on his chest and shoulders. I called the doctor in the afternoon and he called back tonight, suggesting an antihistamine, and a visit to the office if it doesn't clear up pretty much in the next day. </p>
<p>We had a great evening together. He was in the tub as soon as we got home, and ate a big dinner while he filled a page with all the letters of the alphabet, numbers to 20, and as many of the characters on the keyboard as he remembered. We played Xs and Os too, and I taught him "Sprouts" tonight. Bryn showed up as Riku was finishing his dinner, and they had some time together too. </p>
<p>Bryn went off to buy some antihistamine for Riku, which he took just before bedtime. I hope this has disappeared by morning, but somehow I don't think it's going to. The doctor thought it sounded like a contact rash, although he really hadn't played anywhere yesterday that was more than shortly mown grass. </p>
<p>Bedtime was a little later tonight, but I am hoping he sleeps until 7 tomorrow. It's a swimming day and a busy night here tomorrow night too. </p>
