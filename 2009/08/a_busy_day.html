								<h2>A Busy Day For All</h2>
								<p>What a busy day for Riku this ended up being! It started off slowly, with a long snuggle in bed, and with Grandpa finding him under the blankets, a favourite activity from when Riku was just two years old. We both hide under the cover, Doug goes off hmm-m-ming out loud about where Riku could be. Riku giggles away, but not too loudly, and then breaks in to such huge gales of laughter when Doug "discovers" him. </p>
<p>I had sent Akane an email yesterday letting her know that Riku was hoping to talk with her; it didn't work out for yesterday but when we finally came into the kitchen at 7:30, there was a message waiting from Akane on Skype. I rang through right away and Riku had a long chat with her and some time with his Uncle Masu as well. It is fun to hear him speak only in Japanese, except for the odd English word. He proudly showed off his Lego plane and showed them both the new house set too, not yet completed. </p>
<p>Akane had her hair cut yesterday, and now instead of down her back to her bottom it is about shoulder length. I just saw it briefly but it looks great on her. Riku noticed right away, and commented on it too. </p>
<p>While he was chatting, I cut the fresh pineapple up so that Riku could have it with his usual strawberries and banana as requested. He had some time with Bryn at the table, and  did his two daily drawings before we headed upstairs for him to watch Pingu, and for me to shower. </p>
<p>There is no swimming class today or tomorrow, so he and Doug went off to the Exploratorium at 11 A.M., taking along a picnic lunch with them. I expected they would be gone for perhaps two or two and a half hours, but they were away for three and a half hours! Riku spent a long time at a ball table, with the balls spinning around like the pennies do at the BADM. Funny that held his interest for so long, but he was enthusiastic about the giant bubbles too, and had fun at a sand drawing table too. </p>
<p>I had packed a picnic lunch for them, which they ate in the car before going to the library and then on to a playground downtown, which they hadn't been to before. Riku was hoping to get one or two more "Find Waldo" books at the main branch, but apparently they are in great demand. However, he has a nice stack of new books to go through. </p>
<p>I got through a huge number of emails today, and did some tidying up. The house looks fine considering how little time I am spending on it, but it was great to get a few extra things done too. I also just sat, with a hot cup of tea, and completed two Sudoku puzzles. I felt so much better about having caught up with the emails that were causing me to feel most guilty about, and even though there are lots more to do, I was very happy with what I accomplished in all. </p>
<p>I hadn't packed any fruit for Riku at lunch, not expecting them to be away for so long, so Riku sat down for a snack when they came in at 3:30, and then we got busy making that carrot cake we had planned to do yesterday. It was as much fun as always. Riku is very confident about his baking skills now, remembering how to flatten off the dry ingredients with the flat side of a knife, and cracking eggs easily, although still not liking the gooey whites on his hands. We make a good team as he does a great job at adding and stirring, which gives me time to put everything away and do some washing up. Riku is funny and makes me laugh, reminding me more and more of his cousin Bryn with the faces he pulls and the poses he puts on for me. </p>
<p>Just as we were finishing up the cake, Riku suggested we make corn soup for dinner. Hmm, no fresh corn, so he decided we should make some other kind of soup. And eat it in the dining room. A fancy dinner. And we could serve wine to Grandpa, and his Dad, and me too. When I told him that Grandpa didn't drink wine, and that his Dad might prefer beer, he decided we would all have water instead. We have a little socialite on our hands. He does love a gathering of kindred folk, does our boy! I did tell him that we would pick up some fresh corn and make it again soon. </p>
<p>Doug had picked up some breaded fish especially for Riku yesterday, and so he had that for dinner, along with some small Yukon Gold potatoes, and mixed veggies. He ate every bite of the two wedges of fish first, then the potatoes with butter, and finally the veggies. </p>
<p>Just as we were finishing up dinner, two friends of Bryn's—Renaud and Tina—arrived at the door. They live in Paris, France, and are visiting the Bay area for a bit. Both men started talking business so Riku took over entertaining Tina, suggesting they find Waldo together. She was just great with him, really looking along with Riku, and they were very successful. Riku asked for a magnifying glass at one point, to make sure they really had found Waldo's girlfriend. I left them visiting, and had tea in the kitchen, working on another puzzle. A little while later, Riku suggested they go in the dining room and look at his latest Lego project and the two of them sat there finding pieces, which Riku put together. </p>
<p>They finished off their time together with Riku showing both Tina and Renaud his prowess on the computer. He calls it his "blog" although he also tells people that it isn't really his blog. He's very happy with company, old or new, and it shows. He's just comfortable with adults in a way that many children aren't. There isn't even a moment of being hesitant with them, feeling them out. He just assumes they are all good and interesting people and goes from there. I love his social skills! </p>
<p>And it is hilarious to hear all his new English expressions as he talks to them ... "It's not easy, you know; it's hard work!" Bryn has noticed how much his English has improved, although he is sounding very much like his Nana in his expressions. It really is funny to hear it all coming out of him ... "It's just adorable!" or "Isn't that the cutest thing you ever saw?" </p>
<p>No tub tonight, as they all went off for dinner together at 7:30, but Riku was asleep at 8:15, a tired but happy boy for sure. </p>
<p>Off I go ... hoping to get a few more emails written tonight. </p>
