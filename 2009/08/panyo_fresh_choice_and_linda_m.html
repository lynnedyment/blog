								<h2>"Ponyo", "Fresh Choice", and Linda Mar</h2>
								<p>I awoke at 5:50 this morning, and decided to sneak downstairs and crawl into bed with Riku. Often when he has someone in with him, he will sleep longer, but it seems now his body is used to waking at 6:30, as even though I was dozing quietly beside him, he wakened at his usual time. That was just fine, though, as Doug had picked up five Judith Viorst books from the library last night, and we snuggled in bed reading all of them. It was lovely, as we haven't done this many books in the morning for a long time. He liked each and every one of them, and even though he thought he wasn't going to like "The Tenth Good Thing about Barney" (the few and small illustrations were all in black and white), he ended up loving the story, as I knew he would. It had all of his favourite elements in it: a great story, some sad parts, some happy parts, perfect illustrations (once he knew the story), and lots to talk about afterward too. </p>
<p>Bryn sat at the table with Riku for breakfast, and the two of them did some drawing together. Riku has been very good about drawing his two pictures for school each morning before getting on with his day. Caillie is pleased to sit and draw alongside Riku as well, which makes him very happy.</p>
<p>Caillie slept later today than she has since arriving, and came stumbling out of her room at 10 o'clock. I should have wakened her, as we had an early start today, but she was a trouper and even managed to get a shower and eat a quick breakfast before we left the house at 10:40! </p>
<p>We've all been looking forward to seeing this new Japanese film, called Ponyo, and had decided to combine it with lunch out as well. Panyo was delightful, and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. Riku sat on the edge of his chair for about 80% of the movie, and Doug was either nudging me, or me him, as we watched Riku's face lit up while he watched it. He and Caillie both loved the underwater scenes, and the characters, especially Ponyo, were just perfect. </p>
<p>Ten minutes after the movie ended, we were lined up with trays at the ready, for lunch at Fresh Choice, on Caillie's list. She enjoyed it as much as always, and ate three of her favourite corn muffins (they're mine too, and I believe Kelly's as well), as well as lots of good fresh food. Riku chose an assortment of vegetables for his plate, ate every bite of it, and liked a chocolate brownie muffin, much to my surprise. Caillie and Doug both love the soft serve ice cream with caramel sauce, and Riku found cherry jello, topping it off with toasted coconut sprinkles. I always eat such a huge assorted salad plus a baked potato with all the fixings, and so never want dinner that evening. </p>
<p>Caillie, Riku, and I were taking our time finishing up, and taking lots of photos of each other too. Caillie took a few of Riku and me, a rare event, and one or two turned out quite well. Riku really hammed it up for some of them, which kept us all laughing. </p>
<p>We were not all that far from the beach ("Linda Mar") that we went to yesterday, so drove a little further down the coast, and spent an hour there. It was a little windier than yesterday, though, so Caillie bundled herself up in two blankets, protecting herself from the wind, while Riku did his usual scouring of the beach, looking for anything of interest. He's quite happy to wander off on his own, or settle down a little further along from the rest of us, having some quiet time, lying in the sand, and poking about with a stick. I joined him after a while and we went looking together. He found two heart-shaped rocks, and I brought the little one home for myself, at his request; Doug built a little stone structure, which I liked a lot. </p>
<p>Usual evening ... Doug went off to his class, Riku had a long tub time, and he and Caillie started watching "Chicken Run", which arrived from Netflix in the mail today. I made vegetable fried rice for dinner tonight, and allowed them to eat it in front of the TV for a special treat. </p>
<p>After the video was half over, I brought them down to do some drawing at the table, and Bryn showed up just at that point, spending the evening at home. Before bedtime, Riku and Caillie sat at the computer so that she could show him more of the options he has with the drawing program he is so fond of right now. It was fun to see the two of them doing this, as she is patient and he learns quickly. </p>
<p>Caillie was thrilled that Bryn was home tonight,  as she was hoping we would have a chance to play "Spades" with him, which we did. I selected some photos for my blog entry, but was too tired to do anything more than that. I went up to bed at 10:30, but wish I had had the energy to answer a few emails.</p>
