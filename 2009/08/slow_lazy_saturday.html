								<h2>Sociable  Saturday</h2>
								<p>The only plans we had for today was an afternoon outing for Riku with Mari. But of course plans change and it was a fun and busier day for him than we anticipated. </p>
<p>First thing this morning, after we had some snuggling time in our bed upstairs, Riku watched a couple of Caillou segments; he told me the other day he didn't like them anymore (wanting to watch a Japanese action movie for the second or third time), but he had a grin on his face every time I peeked in on him. He almost always has his fruit bowl upstairs while I shower, and it was lovely to see that little smile while he watches something so typically Canadian. </p>
<p>Riku did two drawings for his school homework after breakfast today, he spent a little bit of time using the new drawing program on my computer, and the morning drifted by in a very leisurely manner.</p>
<p>Bryn had sent out an email yesterday to Riku's classmates' parents from Starr King, letting them know that Riku was in town and would be going to the get-together at a playground tomorrow morning. One of the children, Skyler, Riku's "crush" from school here, isn't going tomorrow but her mom suggested a playdate for today instead. Riku was a little reluctant, and said he really wanted to play with Kai instead, so a compromise was reached. Riku and Bryn walked over to the playground near Kai's home, and left a phone message saying they would be there for an hour and a bit. And to Riku's delight, Kai was there and they spent that time together. </p>
<p>I had lunch started when they arrived home just after 11:30, so there was time for a snuggle for Riku with his dad, who had his stomach gurgles listened to while lying there together. Riku, Bryn, and I sat at the table and chatted while Riku slowly ate his lunch. Riku doesn't like to rush while he is eating and we reassured him he had lots of time before Skylar arrived. </p>
<p>This is the first playdate for these children, and I think Riku wasn't sure what they would do together, but it went very well. First they went out and blew some bubbles from the mixture we made up yesterday; they took turns using the can and the wand and both made some big bubbles and tried to catch each other's as they drifted away. </p>
<p>Then they decided they wanted to go to the playground on top of the hill, so off we went. We took the badminton rackets with us, and they spent quite a long time doing that, although it was hot; at some point they got into the shade under the playground structure. They were just sitting talking, and I managed to get a few photos of them. Riku, more and more now, wants to "pose" for the photos, and is constantly striking weird and funny poses. Skylar thought this was very funny, and she copied him on one of them, but mostly smiled at his antics; I'm sure she won his heart again with this reinforcement of his talents! </p>
<p>And just as suddenly as they wanted to go to the playground, they decided they wanted to come back to the house! It's only a five-minute drive, so back we came, and they ran around the garden until it was time for Bryn to take Skylar home.</p>
<p>Oh, I overhead an amusing conversation on the way home. Riku learned some time ago about sperm and the egg, and how the sperm that reaches the egg first is the winner. I showed him a few photos of this, and often in magazines there will be a great photo of the squiggly little guys too. He finds it totally fascinating: here are bits of the conversation. "Do you know about sperm, Skylar? There are thousands of them and they are all trying to reach the egg. This is a serious race. Whoever gets to the egg first is the winner! Did you know that? And we are the winners 'cause we are alive. The losers all die, so we are lucky. But we were the fastest! Sometimes two or three all get there at the same time, so then there is more than just one baby born." I'm not sure how much Sklyar knew, but she knows more now. I did offer one more bit of information today though, and made sure he knew the sperm come from the men and the egg is in the woman.  </p>
<p>When Bryn returned home, Mari still hadn't called, so Riku and I continued to read on the sofa, going over each item on each page of the volcano book he borrowed. I'm amazed at what he remembers and what he asks; I was reading as quickly as I could to answer his questions! Riku went to the bookcase to see if he could find "The Little Prince" but came back instead with a Waldo book. We searched for Waldo for the longest time, but finally just gave up and concentrated on all the funny things we could find on each page. </p>
<p>About 3:15, Brent, Mikela, and Quentin came over to await Mari's call, and Riku was just delighted to see Quentin. He ran to his room and brought out the big basket of small cars, Bryn brought out the smaller basket containing his own wooden cars, from when he was a little guy, and Riku decided he needed a fire station and an airport too! Quentin is a sweet little guy, very interested in everything, and watched Riku closely as they played together. At one point Riku clasped Quentin's face between his hands, so very sweet with him. </p>
<p>At 4 P.M., they all headed out to a playground together and the plan was to meet Mari there, and then after a bit they all went out for sushi, to a new place in the Mission. </p>
<p>Doug and I had dinner and worked on a difficult Sudoku puzzle; with tough ones like this one, I just sit and listen to how Doug makes decisions about where the numbers go! At 6:30, Bryn walked in saying Mari and Riku would be along in ten minutes. It took them an extra twenty minutes, and it turned out it was because Mari let Riku take a <strong>lot</strong> of photos on her cell phone; she thinks maybe a hundred of them! </p>
<p>He obviously had a great time, and in the tub told me that I would really have liked the sushi as there was no meat, just delicious soup with tofu, but not so much tofu, and "salad" "'cause salads are really good for you." I'm sure he meant there were greens in the soup. He described another dish to me as well, but used Japanese words so even though he was enthusiastic about it, and thought I would be too, I have no idea what it was. </p>
<p>He was given a few minutes to show Mari the drawing program on the computer, which he demonstrated to her very well. I am so amazed at how quickly he has learned to use all the various "tools" in this program! I also told him that Mari could read one Shel Silverstein poem to him, so that was fun for them both. It was a bit of a nonsense verse, and Riku had to help with a couple of the words, which was fun to see. </p>
<p>We said goodbye to everyone... Bryn drove Mari to a friend's home, and then he and Doug went out to a movie. Riku and I read a few more pages of poems, and he was asleep at 8:10 tonight, not bad considering we had a later tub start and more distractions for him too. But, a busy day and a relaxing tub meant he drifted off very quickly. </p>
<p>I called Gail, IM'd with Kelly who had such a great day in West Vancouver, showing Gregg all the familiar places she knew growing up, and ending with a delicious dinner out, and a walk around Robson Street before bed for her. </p>
<p>All's well in my world! </p>
