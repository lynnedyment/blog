								<h2>An Unhurried Day and a Cook in the House</h2>
								<p>Today was a perfect day all 'round. The sun was shining and the day warm from the moment we woke up; Sutro Tower was clearly visible, which is always a good sign from Riku's point of view (it means it could be an Ocean Beach day), and we had nothing on our agenda but the Bay Area Discovery Museum in Marin County. </p>
<p>Riku had French toast for his "second" breakfast with Bryn, and drew a robot picture at the table before getting on with his day. I would like nothing more than a picture a day, but it doesn't always happen. </p>
<p>We didn't have to rush to get out of the house, and so he had time to look at some magazines while I packed up a few snacks. He also helped me make my bed this morning, smoothing out his side of it very carefully, and placing the pillows in exactly the same way I did on my side. Riku likes to be given little chores to do, and later today he helped out too.</p>
<p>Before we left, Riku asked for a bowl of pineapple and strawberries, with "sprinkles" on them, meaning the crushed flax seeds. He really really likes this, and told me he was going to ask for this at home in Japan too. </p>
<p>We spent four hours at the museum today, and it could not have been better. I didn't once have to suggest that we move on to something else, knowing we had lots of time to just meander. Of course he headed straight for the boat and found lots of other children interested in pretending they were sinking, or that they had spotted sharks and whales. </p>
<p>Riku wanted to eat our lunch outside at the picnic tables today. It's often too cool and/or windy out there, but the weather co-operated today. While I was waiting for our snacks and beverages, Riku had to wash his hands, and for the first time ever I let him go off to the restroom on his own. We had just been there, and he was fine with leaving me in line, returning shortly, and happy with his independence. </p>
<p>He ate a great lunch, and I bought him a bag of "Pirate Booty" as always for the ride home. </p>
<p>We meandered everywhere ... up to ring the bell, through the twig house maze, back to the boat, and today spent quite a bit of time in the craft area where he made a butterfly for the kitchen window. He window-painted too, as there were no other children there when we first went in. It is usually so crowded that he hadn't bothered with it the last couple of times we were there. </p>
<p>They had a wonderful exhibit in the big hall, of the lives of Chinese children, put together by the Boston Museum. There were hands-on exhibits, and buttons to push to listen in English, Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish. Riku chose the Chinese every time, and in the "language" area, repeated all the words as he heard them, except for one very long sentence. He gathered together pretend Chinese food for me in the kitchen area, and we saw several videos of the children introducing their parents, and watched them cooking & planting rice, and sitting down for a family meal. There was also a little Chinese theatre stage set up, and Riku donned a costume, wrapping it around himself so that he could appear as a scary figure alongside the two little girls all done up in the pretty costumes they had put on. This was so much fun and we spent a good deal of time in that area. </p>
<p>Once we had finished, Riku decided it was time to leave for home. Of course we stopped in at the gift shop, where he chose ten pieces of shiny "jewels" in a small velvet bag, Instead of watching the three pennies I gave him for the spinning circle spin down and into the base, he let them all go, one by one, caught them, and put those in the bag too! He sat happily in the back seat, eating his cheese popcorn, finishing off the grapes, and most of the cherries we had taken along for snacks. </p>
<p>We arrived home at 4:15 and I decided to make a cream soup with the asparagus Susan had left for us. As I snapped the first stalk, I thought Riku might enjoy helping, and I was so glad I asked. He was a big help to me, snapping all the stalks just right, then trimming off the ends for the garnish, and cutting the remaining stalks into one inch pieces. He  was very careful with the knife and I left him to it, after watching him make the first few cuts. When that was all done he got up on a chair, stirring the veggies for ten minutes, and then carefully stirring again, once the hot milk was added. He's very patient when doing this step, much to my surprise.There was only a half recipe, but Bryn, Riku, and I all had a bowl, and Riku asked for more of the steamed tops to be added to his bowl. He ate every single bite, and told me after dinner that he wants to help me with dinner every night. I shall try to make sure I make dishes that give him something to do; the world can use more men who like to cook! </p>
<p>Riku had his tub, spent some time reading in the living room, and then asked for another bowl of fruit with flax seeds. We were in bed reading Shel Silverstein at 7:45. He had a busy active day and was asleep shortly after 8, after asking me what our plans were for tomorrow. I think if Sutro Tower is visible in the morning, we might just head out for an Ocean Beach day. </p>
<p>Bryn spent the evening at home with us, working, and heading off to bed early. I'm off too! </p>
<p>Oh, nice surprise in the fridge this morning, as last night Soo gave Bryn a very large portion of a tofu and fresh vegetable dish that I was always very fond of. She is coming over next week to make some special dishes for Bryn and Riku (likely a meatball clay pot dish), and some vegetarian potstickers for us too. Lucky us! </p>
