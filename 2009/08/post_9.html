								<h2>NOT an Ocean Beach Day!</h2>
								<p>Riku's swimming lesson today wasn't until 3:30, and so we had a perfect day planned for us. A quiet early morning at home, and then off we would go to Ocean Beach for some sand time and a picnic lunch. The weather seemed to be co-operating as the fog was lifting nicely from the time we woke until we left. Way back on Fulton Avenue, I could see white caps, not a good sign at all, and I was right. We pluckily made our way to the beach anyway, with sand toys and our lunch, but we had to huddle near the wall, or get too much sand blown our way, and after a not-very-comfortable few bites, we moved down a bit to play. But we only lasted about a half hour, and Riku suggested we go for a milkshake instead! </p>
<p>Even there we didn't have any luck, at least not our plan to sit and look at the beach from the cozy booths at Louis' diner. It was very busy and they have a $10 minimum spending limit on the booths when they are busy. Their "cash only" policy did us in, and so we ordered one vanilla shake to go, which Riku and I shared on our way to the lovely calm non-windy little lake just up the road a bit. We had been there twice before and Riku was happy to just walk along the pathways, counting the wildlife ... mostly ducks and squirrels today, and admiring the huge dragon flies hovering above the water. </p>
<p>I had forgotten my camera for the first time this trip, so missed some lovely shots. We were home at 2:30, time for a leisurely hearty snack for Riku before his class. Bryn had ordered a couple of Lego kits for Riku and they arrived today! It couldn't have been better timing, as he had time to get started on the plane kit before we left for his lesson.</p>
<p>Josh was his instructor again today, and they had a good time, ending the session by blowing water from the noodles on one of the other teachers. We came right home today, no stop for doughnuts, but time for searching for Waldo with Doug, a long warm tub, and then dinner and Lego building right up to bedtime at 7:20. </p>
<p>We had time for lots of stories, and yet Riku had a little trouble falling asleep tonight. I had hoped he would have an extra fifteen minutes or so, but I just told him to relax and not worry about falling asleep, and walked out the door at the usual 8 P.M. </p>
<p>I was very tired tonight, much more so than usual, but of course didn't want to give up the time to catch up on emails, and some family tree work too. I think it might have had something to do with my tasty glass of hard cider from Nanaimo too, as I was soooo relaxed. </p>
