								<h2>Bubbles, Badminton, and a Playdate</h2>
								<p>Riku came up into our room at 7 A.M. today, on the nose. Later I asked him when he woke, and he said "at 6:30." I asked him what he did with the extra half hour and was told "I read, like you told me too, and then I tidied up a bit." That would be Riku! </p>
<p>I had a "recipe" for super bubbles that I had cut from the paper ages ago, and this morning that was our plan. Riku measured and gently stirred the mixture together in my largest bowl, and then he, Doug, and I went out to see how it worked. It was a bit tricky as there was a breeze blowing, which immediately took the bubble away, but we made up a second batch, adding more corn syrup and that made a huge difference. Doug and Riku both managed to get large bubbles in the air, although Riku at first had much more fun breaking them than making them himself. After I had taken some photos, I tried my hand at it, with the tin can as a "wand", and managed to get some very big and long bubbles in the air. Riku was delighted with the whole process and no doubt we shall do this again. </p>
<p>Once again we were hoping for an Ocean Beach day, as we could see Sutro Tower clearly when we woke up. However, I prefer going out right after lunch, as I can get a few things done in the morning, while Riku draws, and enjoys a quiet few hours after breakfast. However, we may have to rethink this, as we have yet to get to the beach! The fog came rolling in just after noon today. </p>
<p>After lunch, Riku decided that instead of driving to Stow Lake (plan number two), he wanted to go back to the playground on the hill, mostly to see if there were any friends there. Except for one child, we were the only ones there at first, but it was fun anyway. Riku swung for a bit, and then we played badminton for a long time. He took a break to play on the climbing structures, then came over to me, lay down on the bench with his head in my lap, and his hat over his eyes for a few minutes, chatting away, and then we blew some bubbles. I had taken along two small containers and the wind just picked these tiny ones up and blew them away. Back to the badminton practice, and Riku was very pleased, as he managed to hit back the birdies three times to me! He did better than I for sure. </p>
<p>Home for a fifteen-minute break, then he and Doug walked over for an hour and a half visit with Kai at his home. They played with Lego, and Riku had a great time; he and Doug walked back home together, but once here he told me that he wishes he had his own Lego here. </p>
<p>He drew two pictures for his Japanese homework requirements after dinner. Riku has been drawing regularly in a book that I bought for him in Nanaimo, and has done lots of those already, but now we need to have him concentrate on filling up 24-plus pages for his teacher. </p>
<p>Dinner, tub, a little computer time with the drawing program, and tucked in and asleep just before 8 P.M. tonight. </p>
<p>I had a long chat with one of my doula moms while Riku was at Kai's, and we made arrangements for her to come for a visit on Monday after Riku's swimming class. I'm sure he will be delighted to have a seven-month-old little fellow to coo over. </p>
