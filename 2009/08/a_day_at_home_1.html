								<h2>A Day at Home, Bubbles and Balls</h2>
								<p>Despite our best intentions, and with the exception of Riku's swimming lesson at 12:30, we ended up spending the entire day at 1361! We even had an exceptionally lazy morning: Riku had asked before bedtime last night if he could paint, and I told him he could in the morning. The minute he came up to our room, at 7:10 today, he whispered to me, asking if he could paint right away. And I gave him the answer I often get from him when I ask him a question this trip "Of course!" We came right down and he got to it, painting a big, bright, colourful, and very simple drawing. Sure brightened up my kitchen! </p>
<p>Riku ate breakfast with his dad this morning, and they had a little relaxing time together before we went to the window to wave goodbye to Bryn. Riku decides each morning which portion of a video he is going to watch while I shower, and I usually watch a bit of it with him after I finish. Today he chose "The Wizard of Oz", the original version and Doug was just coming out of the shower as I got it started. He sat with Riku "for just a little while" but ended up watching the entire movie with him! </p>
<p>The city was covered in fog this morning and we kept looking out the window, watching the city slowly emerge. By the time we left for Riku's class the day was perfect, with sunny blue skies and no wind. </p>
<p>Riku had his first male swimming instructor today; on the way in, he told me he hoped he had Jessica today (he's had her twice), but decided once we were there and saw just two teachers, that he would like to have the man. He was very pleased when he called Riku's name, and they had a good lesson, with lots of smiles. At the very end of the class, he and Riku were blowing water at each other through tubes, and we could hear Riku laughing from the other side of the pool. </p>
<p>Today Riku said he would like a Krispy Kreme doughnut, and he finished off his sandwich before we got there. He chose the same small iced doughnuts with sprinkles and ate one of them after finishing up more lunch at home. That was when he decided that he wanted to just stay home. I was packing up snacks and water for the beach trip, but he was certain about his decision. An hour later, after I got a few little chores done, I suggested we go to the playground at the top of the hill. It was quite warm out and there is always a lovely breeze there, and lots of children too, but again he said he wanted to just stay put. </p>
<p>We were expecting Soo over tonight to cook pot stickers and a hot pot for a small crowd of people ... Brent, Michela, Quentin, and Mari ... and I asked Riku to help me tidy up a bit. There was sand in the hallway from the playground yesterday and Riku maneuvered the vacuum cleaner nicely down the hall and around the corner to get all that picked up. When I took over, he decided on his own to tidy up around his desk in the kitchen, moving his backpack to his room, and even tidying out his treasure box from under his bed. At one point I found him setting the table with placemats, but I told him we would more likely just be snacking on the food as it was made, and not sitting down all at once. </p>
<p>Once we finished up, we went into the garden to sweep up a bit. Riku had been out for a bit, blowing bubbles with the big bowl of bubble mixture I had left on the table. He was blowing huge bubbles today, and multi-bubbles too, and suggested I get the camera out and try to get a photo of some of them. I did it, too, as the mixture was thicker and lasted longer today once the bubble was off the wand. One of the things he really wanted me to capture was him with a "caught" bubble on the wand, and I did it. Whew! </p>
<p>Then, as promised, we played with a ball and "catcher" set I had bought in Nanaimo. We've been doing lots of catching and throwing, as well as playing badminton, and I can see such a big improvement each time we play. And how he loves it! He will call out "You should have gotten that one!" or say "Oh, too bad, you just missed it" at other times. It's sheer pleasure to have this time with him, as there is lots of laughing going on, and lots of give and take too. He will often run for the ball even if I miss it. </p>
<p>Bryn was home at 5 P.M. and called Soo to say he was on his way to pick her up. Oops! Miscommunication, as she had changed the day to tomorrow. Bryn had to get busy calling and emailing everyone to let them know, and cancelling his dinner at Susan and Kevin's tomorrow night. I had mentioned to Bryn that Riku has a class tomorrow again, making up for a class he was to have taken a week from Friday, when they will be away. Poor Riku! He burst into tears saying he didn't want to take lessons every day, and then burst into tears again when he learned that no one was coming over for dinner tonight either! He was really upset and it took some time to calm him down. I could tell how disappointed he was about both events. He sat on my lap for the longest time, sobbing away, until he finally settled down and decided to have his tub. </p>
<p>Oh, his rash was much improved this morning, although had not disappeared completely. I spoke with Dr. Kelly this morning, who said we could give it one more day and see if it was much improved before deciding to bring him in. He would have seen him this morning, but Riku hadn't been scratching it since the night before last. Fingers crossed that it goes away completely by tomorrow. </p>
<p>We had a lovely dinner together, as we played so many paper games ... our own version of Xs and Os, which we played yesterday, then Riku remembered that we hadn't played "Hangman" this trip, so we had a few goes at that too. I did really badly at it ... one of his words was "Dyment" and I never did guess it. Riku even gave me a chance at a second noose set-up, but to no avail. I lost my head! </p>
<p>Two funny things tonight from Riku. Just as he finished dinner, I asked him what he would like for dessert and the choices were his second tiny doughnut or some fruit. He chose the fruit saying "I don't think I should have a doughnut before bedtime. I will save it for tomorrow." His eyes lit up though when he saw my chocolate covered coconut ice cream bar, and I offered him a bite. He said that he didn't think it was a good idea to have that either, but he might have some tomorrow instead. What he wanted and got was a "big bowl of strawberries." </p>
<p>While he was finishing those up, he got down from the table and started looking through Doug's basket where he keeps his stack of reading material. I asked Riku what he was looking for and this was his answer "Oh, I think I am growing up quickly now because I read magazines, and I work on my blog."! He didn't spend much time on the computer at all today, drew perhaps for ten minutes, but he did fill out one of the forms again on the colouring site, asking me again for his email address which he carefully hunt and pecked out. It was rikudyment@gmail.com and he is getting used to typing it now. What a funny little guy he is! </p>
