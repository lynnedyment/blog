								<h2>Swimming, Guests, and the Playground</h2>
								<p>Riku was awake very early this morning. I have the monitor on in my room, and heard little rustling sounds at 6:10 today. It was obvious that Riku was awake, so downstairs I went and saw his face peeking out at me, with a big smile, as I came toward him. We got a nice stack of books out, and he sat looking through them while I got his fruit bowl ready. I don't know how much longer Riku will be happy cuddling up reading, but I hope for a long time yet: it's such a wonderful way to start our day. </p>
<p>Bryn had breakfast with Riku today, and then Riku watched some rarely-viewed short-story versions of two classic Hans Christian Anderson tales. I had a quick shower and we made up the bed together as has become a habit. Riku knows exactly how to place the three pillows on the side that he makes up.</p>
<p>I had to vacuum the carpet on the main floor this morning, just briefly, as there was lots of sand, including some from the various playground excursions. Riku happened to pick up one of the sofa cushions while I was in the living room, and we decided the base of the sofa seat could use a good cleaning too. I left Riku to do that while I continued on with the laundry, and he did a very thorough job of it too. He's a great little helper. </p>
<p>We were taking Kevin's car in to be serviced this morning, so off we went to do that. It was already hot out there, and if we hadn't had swimming today, and a guest coming over later, this would have been <strong>the</strong> day, at last. Riku said later on that tomorrow we <strong>would</strong> go to Ocean Beach, even if it was foggy. We're both ready for this! </p>
<p>This was Riku's third swimming lesson today, and for the first time there was not a word of protest. And he had such a successful lesson too! He dog-paddled alone for the very first time, and I wish I had been able to catch the big proud smile on his face as he paddled toward us. The instructor had asked him to swim to the rail nearest to us, but he turned and swam even further! He floated as well, although it was hard to see if the teacher was supporting him in any spot from where we were sitting. However, Bryn had asked me to sign him up for more lessons, if they were available, and so he now has five more scheduled in the next ten days. </p>
<p>We headed right home for lunch, before one of my doula moms arrived with her seven-month-old son, Daniel. I have only seen photos of him since the day after he was born; it has been hard for us to schedule a visit, and since Natallia is starting back to college next week this was our only chance. Riku and I had some quiet time before they arrived, though, which was great, as he was ready to give his attention to the baby. He's very gentle with little ones, and was happy to keep him amused. We put Daniel in his favourite position, on his tummy, and in front of the mirror on the bottom of the hearth, so he could see himself. He's darling; looks like his mommy, and is getting ready to push himself up into a crawling position. </p>
<p>Before we parted, Natallia gave me a lovely colourful tablecloth and matching napkins from her homeland, Russia. We plan to get together in October so she can meet Mirei too. By that time Daniel will be crawling and will have cut his first teeth, too. </p>
<p>We had tea and a snack and after a while all walked over to the playground so that Riku could play with Kai. They ran around, Riku spent some time flirting with Emi, Kai's one-and-a-half-year-old sister, and he did some climbing. </p>
<p>Natallia and Daniel left before we reached the house, and I popped Riku into the tub as soon as he had looked at the two new books Bryn had ordered, from a series that Susan introduced to us called "Eye Witness Books". These two are on insects and amphibians and the minute his tub was finished he was at the table going through one page after another, with lots of questions, and lots of answers too. He had initially been sorry that his Lego hadn't arrived, but after starting to go through the first one he said "Why did I say I didn't want these books? They're <strong>fabulous</strong>, his latest favourite word. </p>
<p>Bryn surprised us by showing up just as Riku was finishing his dinner. We were looking at the insect book, and Riku and Bryn continued looking through it, and then Riku told him about his swimming lesson. He also started scratching at his arms and legs, and has some kind of an allergic reaction to something he thinks he got at the playground when running through the longish grass. He thought perhaps they were insect bites, but it looks more like a fine rash. I hope the aloe gel I put on it helps. It did seem to cool it down (his skin was quite red and hot to the touch too) as he had stopped scratching at bedtime. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep before 8 o'clock tonight, just by minutes, but I do hope he sleeps in a little later tomorrow. It's a free day for us, though, with no commitments, so here's hoping for an Ocean Beach day!  </p>
