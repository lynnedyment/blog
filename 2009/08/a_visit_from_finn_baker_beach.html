								<h2>A Visit With Finn, Baker Beach, and "Sea Glass"</h2>
								<p>Riku and I had a long snuggle in bed this morning. I was awake and at the computer the day before when he woke at 8:30, and he told me that from now on, he wanted me to stay in bed in the morning so he could come up and snuggle with me. We giggle and he tells me his dreams, and asks about mine, and then he asks, "What's the plan for today?" </p>
<p>He had his fruit bowl in our bed, while I showered, and after the second part of his breakfast he went outside to crack open a geode I had bought for him in Nanaimo. It was hard! He used Doug's hammer and knocked away at it, until he finally put it on the bricks and whacked it really hard. Finally it broke into lots of pieces; I think he was disappointed not to have one large crystal emerge, but the bits were fun too, especially after he washed all the gritty stuff away and had a look at them all outside. </p>
<p>Amelia had a sleepover last night, and Kevin had a few errands to run, so I volunteered to have the children here this morning, while Susan and Kevin got ready for their week at a farm, starting tomorrow. However, Amelia and her guest were busy for the morning and early afternoon, so Kevin dropped Finn off to play with Riku. Riku was thrilled, as he had been asking if he could have them visit, and was quite happy that Finn made it over ... except when Finn broke his log building. However, he was quickly reassured that Grandpa and his dad could rebuild it all, exactly the same, and then he proceeded to show Finn how to build structures. Finn had a great time, and it was very cute to watch them. </p>
<p>They also went outside for a while, sweeping and digging, then upstairs where Riku got out the sit-on train for Finn, and puttered about downstairs too, pulling toys out of the big basket in the laundry room. They had lunch together, and then Finn followed Doug upstairs and spent a while there. When Doug came down, Finn followed him, and then asked Doug, bending over and asking very clearly in a hard-to-resist voice "Grandpa, do you want to go upstairs with me again"? How could he resist such a query? So up they went and Riku had a little time on his own for drawing. </p>
<p>We had made plans with Susan and Kevin and the children to meet up at Baker's Beach in the afternoon, and although it never did get as warm and sunny as I had hoped for, we packed up and left about two o'clock . </p>
<p>Amelia and Riku walked with Doug and me down to the far end of the beach, searching for "sea glass", Amelia's latest passion. You have to have sharp eyes to find the tiny tiny bits of coloured glass, with smooth edges caused by rolling and tumbling about in the sea. I have only ever seen quite large pieces, but even the biggest bits we found today were minuscule. That didn't curb the children's enthusiasm for looking, though, and soon Bryn and Kevin joined in the search too. There were a couple of orange pieces, a lot of green, a few white ones, and Amelia found the only blue one! She and Riku carefully tucked the treasures into the pockets of their kangaroo jackets, although at the end of the day Riku handed all his over to Amelia, but one. He told me she was collecting them, and he wasn't, but it will be fun to look for more of these at Ocean Beach one day. </p>
<p>Finn happily trundled about the beach, the two dads watched over the children and chatted, Doug spent a lot of time with the children when they were still in searching mode, and I sat and took photos once we gave up looking for more glass. </p>
<p>Susan and I had packed up some snacks, so we had cheese and crackers, cherries, Fig Newtons, and various flavours of potato chips. It all hit the spot, although Susan and I would have liked a big thermos of tea, which neither of us thought of beforehand. </p>
<p>We left close to 5 P.M., with Bryn accompanying Susan and family for dinner at a 60s Mexican-style restaurant. Riku was anxious to watch a movie he had borrowed from Amelia, and so after a nice deep warm tub, he was sitting up in bed set to eat his dinner there as Bryn had promised he could. Doug kept him company while I made dinner, and I sat with them while Riku ate. They stopped just a half hour short of the end of the movie, but Riku was fine with that. He knew ahead of time that it was going to be time for bed before it ended, and accepted it gracefully. </p>
<p>He was asleep at 8:30 tonight; I cleaned up the kitchen, wrote up my blog entry, answered a few emails, went through some photos for tomorrow, and went to bed at 11:30.</p>
