								<h2>A Funeral, Two Beaches, and Two Magicians</h2>
								<p>'twas a lovely day today, even though it started off on a sad note. Sparkley and Bill, the two goldfish from Sacramento, passed on to the great ocean in the sky during the night. One wasn't looking good at all when we went to bed last night, so I had changed the water and separated them into two different bowls, but it didn't help. We had a little funeral service, Ã  la "The Tenth Good Thing about Barney" (a Judith Viorst book my children loved as children). Caillie, Riku, and I all thought of something kind or good to say about the fish, and then gently slipped them, one at a time, into the toilet. We had a second ceremony for the second one, trying to come up with different things to say as we let this one go on his/her way. </p>
<p>The rest of the day was much happier, as Caillie, Riku, and I had a picnic lunch at a rocky little beach, somewhat sheltered from the wind, tucked in front of a big rock. We were at a beach not too far from Riku's swimming lesson and perhaps we will go again on Wednesday, after his final swimming lesson. As the wind picked up, a local told us that just five or six minutes down the highway was a large sandy beach; the sun was likely out there, as the fog was lifting, and it's usually warmer. </p>
<p>So we gathered up our blankets and picnic boxes, and drove off to a beach further south. We had good directions, as there was a Taco Bell at the front of the huge parking lot. Another fellow told us the locals call it Taco Bell beach, and that stuck well enough that now I can't remember the actual name for it. It was still windy, but we agreed for Riku's sake that we would stay for fifteen minutes, and ended up enjoying it for more than an hour and a half. </p>
<p>Caillie and Riku drew their names in the sand, and we sat and watched the high waves and the surfers. As always, Riku was as happy as a clam sitting and lying in the sand, digging holes, and filling them in again. We all had such a great time, as there was lots to see, including a large flock of pelicans that seemed happy to be at this particular beach too. </p>
<p>On the way back to the car we stopped in for a snack, a cheese and bean burrito for Riku, and a seven layer burrito for Caillie. I had ordered one earlier, as I hadn't packed myself a sandwich, not intending to be out long enough to be hungry after my big breakfast. </p>
<p>Riku got into a warm tub as soon as we got home, Doug went off to the library, and Caillie learned some new card tricks on the computer. She has been showing me some wonderful card tricks, one that she learned when she was just four years old, and now with a renewed interest in learning more, I am seeing lots more. </p>
<p>I read Riku a book Doug picked up this afternoon, called "Monster Goose", a parody of the "Mother Goose" verses, and even though Riku initially did not like the illustrations, by the end of the book he quite enjoyed the way they were done. He was asleep at 7:55, and Caillie was ready to show Doug her card tricks once he had eaten. He gave her a few tips, and showed her a couple more, promising to teach her the best one before she leaves. </p>
<p>Card time followed, but both Hans and Kelly called to chat in between, so I did a little tidying up and was ready when she finished up. She showed me one last trick (she's good at them too!), and went off to read, while I went through photos for the blog, and wrote up the last one. Bedtime late for me again, but with lots done too! </p>
