								<h2>A Full Fun Day!</h2>
								<p>I had just enough time to read a story to Riku in bed this morning, while he ate his fruit, before he and Bryn left at 7:20 for breakfast at Jim's Restaurant with Mari. Riku loves hash browns and has been eating them since he was a little guy at this "greasy spoon" on Mission Street. Mari came back to the house for a minute for final goodbyes, and then she and Bryn headed off to walk to the bus stop. </p>
<p>Today is the day we had set aside for a long leisurely visit to the Coyote Point Museum. Riku had enjoyed it all so much last week, when we were there with Susan and the children, and we decided Caillie and Doug would like it too. I packed up a big picnic lunch and we were off. There really is so much to do and see there, and we all had a great time. Caillie and Riku did all the hands-on fun parts first, with the vortex and flying foam parts and more, and then strolled around the large area upstairs with so many interesting displays. Riku and Caillie lingered over these, calling to each other to come to see what they had found. </p>
<p>The animal section was next and Riku couldn't wait to show Doug and Caillie the huge yellow banana slug he discovered last week. We did manage to spot the coyote this time, although he was sleeping, much to Riku's disappointment. There was lots to see, though ... otters at feeding time, snakes, frogs, butterflies, birds, sleeping porcupines and badgers. </p>
<p>Right at noon, Riku announced he was hungry and wanted to eat right then! So we went back to the same picnic area as last time, mostly so that Riku and Caillie could climb the same tree he climbed last week. Everyone was hungry and we enjoyed our lunches first, and then Riku and Caillie did some climbing. There was still more to see inside the museum, though, so back we went, and Riku spotted the coyote, wide awake and standing up looking right out at us! We were all very excited, and managed to get some good photos of him. </p>
<p>We had heard there was a big new playground on the grounds, so we drove toward the entry gate, and discovered "Magic Kingdom", a lovely top-notch playground with a huge enclosed twisty slide, built into a massive play structure. There were also swings, and regular slides, and <br />
"creatures" to climb on and in. It was too hot for Doug and me, but Caillie and Riku had a great time and Riku particularly did not want to leave.</p>
<p>There was a beach nearby and that appealed to me, so we walked toward the water, through a huge flock of Canada Geese (Riku now knows how big and green their BMs are!), but realized we couldn't get to the beach without walking too far in the heat. Riku begged for more time at the playground, Doug and I found a shady tree just outside the play area, and eventually it was time to leave for home, and a playdate with Ian for Riku. </p>
<p>Caillie finished her book yesterday, so she and Doug went to the library on 24th Street, coming home with two new books for her to read. I'm sure she won't get through both of them, but it doesn't hurt to have a spare. Later in the evening she read bits of one to Kelly, and it sounded like a perfect book for her. </p>
<p>Ian's parents picked Riku up at 4:20 and dropped him back home, after more playground time at a local spot. They had a great time together, and Bryn arrived home just in time to have a chat with Wendy, Ian's mom, before saying goodbye. </p>
<p>I popped Riku right into the tub, and finished off making a dinner I knew Riku and Caillie would enjoy ... fresh corn chowder, with two pieces of Riku's favourite fish fillets, and sides of veggies for them both. I also made a lemon pudding cake, an old favourite from when Kelly and Bryn were little. Caillie liked it very much, but Riku not so much. Instead he had a bowl of fresh pineapple, and we saved a dish of the pudding for Bryn, who liked it very much. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep at 7:45 tonight, leaving Caillie and me time for two games of cards, before she went off with her new book to read while I got in some time on the computer.  </p>
<p>Hot hot night here! We have the fan going in our bedroom for the first time this month. </p>
