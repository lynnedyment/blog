								<h2>Starr King Picnic for Riku ... and Movie Day!</h2>
								<p>Bryn and Riku left the house promptly at 10 A.M. for a summer get-together for the Mandarin students at Starr King. Riku was hoping to see more of his former classmates, but only three of them, all girls (Sasha, Daisy, and Skylar), were there, and they obviously had fun as they got home more than a half hour later than it was to have ended. </p>
<p>It was a hot sunny day out there, although it was nice and cool here in the house, so I was totally unaware of it. Kelly called from Vancouver and we had a nice long chat, a rarity these days, about all that she and Gregg had seen and were planning to see in the next two days. They drove to say hello to a former neighbour, and Kelly has plans to meet up with one of my Vancouver friends tomorrow. </p>
<p>Bryn and Riku arrived home, hot and sweaty, at 12:40. Riku had his share of sunshine and heat, as had Bryn, so we decided to go off to see "Up" together. Riku just missed out by days seeing it in March. </p>
<p>Doug had taken the bus to the Four Star Theatre to see a double feature, leaving us with the car. We drove off to the Kabuki very soon after Riku had a bite to eat, and then filled up on popcorn at the theatre. Riku and I liked it more than Bryn did; Bryn thought the old man in the movie was grumpier than he should have been, given that he was such a likeable fellow all of his life. Life can take its tolls, though, and by the end he was back to his old kind self. </p>
<p>We stopped in at a big Japanese bookstore after the movie for a very thick magazine for Riku, and spotted some mochi on a stick, as well as some sticky soy delicacies, which Riku promptly ate. He sat in front of a replica of a famous Osaka castle while eating them. </p>
<p>Riku had a nice long relaxing tub before dinner tonight, a good idea on these hot days: it cools him down enough that he enjoys his dinner more. After he got his PJs on, Riku showed me a yellow metal ring he had found with his Dad, I believe. I was telling him what one did with a ring on a wedding day, saying "With this ring, I thee wed." and slipping it on his finger. He took it off and held my hand, slipping it on my ring finger and saying "With this ring, I will love you forever." Riku has such a tender heart. </p>
<p>I made up a bowl of noodles with lots of veggies in it for his dinner, which he ate while perusing his magazine.He has been declining dessert these past few days, nixing both custard and fresh fruit. I think he is just eating a lot with dinner and then realizing that he is full. </p>
<p>I put the timer on so that Riku could have fifteen minutes on the computer with his drawing program, but surprisingly he shut if off after five minutes and came and joined me on the chesterfield. I had been sorting through any of the books in the living room that might still be of interest to Riku, and so we sat and read a half dozen he hadn't seen or heard for many months. </p>
<p>I hoped to have him in bed a half hour earlier than usual, but somehow the time disappeared,and I walked out his door just after 8 o'clock as usual.</p>
<p>Bryn was just dashing out the door to see one of Doug's afternoon movies, which he especially enjoyed. It was a Japanese film ("Departures"), and won the Oscar for "Best Foreign Language Film." Bryn suggested that I join him and less than one minute later we were in the car and off to the movies! We both enjoyed it very much, although Doug was quite weepy during parts of it, and I wasn't. We all thought the acting of the entire cast was wonderful, and it was a very interesting foreign culture story. I always have questions after a movie like this, though... </p>
<p>Home at 11 P.M. and too tired to do anything but head for bed. The movie was a nice last-minute decision, though, and I'm glad I went for it. An evening movie is a rare event for me these last couple of years! </p>
