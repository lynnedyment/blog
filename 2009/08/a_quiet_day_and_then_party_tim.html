								<h2>A Quiet Day and Then ... Party Time!</h2>
								<p>Riku had his swimming lesson booked for noon today, so we spent a quiet morning at home. Bryn didn't have to go dashing off to work, so he and Riku sat at the table together eating breakfast and I joined Riku later on. He was drawing while I read the paper, and he asks the same question... "What's happening?" So we talk about wars, and fires, and good people and bad people. While I showered Riku watched the end of the "Dumbo" video, and then the rest of the morning flew by. He rediscovered his wooden box filled with lots of shells, so he cleared and cleaned that out, admiring his favourites again. He asked me to please never get rid of that box with the shells as it is very special for him, but he wants it at my house. </p>
<p>We sat and looked for Waldo together before lunch too, a very favourite pastime just now. </p>
<p>Today Riku's instructor was Taryn, and he decided that she was his favourite so far. He always finishes off with a huge smile, as he comes out of the pool, but we can often hear him chatting in the pool too. </p>
<p>I caught sight of a fish and chips shop yesterday, and so today Doug walked over and put in an order to go. We came right home, and Riku really loved the fish. He made lots of comments about how good it was, and we all enjoyed it. The fries were good but Riku was happy with just the fish, and asked if we could have that again really soon.  </p>
<p>It was too foggy again for Ocean Beach but gorgeous here, so Riku suggested a trip to the playground at the top of the hill again. It was very quiet, to our surprise, but we wanted to play badminton anyway, so that was fine. Eventually another boy showed up, and he and Riku played for a bit, but Riku really just me to hit the birdie to him, to give him a better chance of returning it. I suggested going to another playground too, where we didn't have to worry so much about hitting the ball so hard, but after the hour there, Riku was ready for something else. </p>
<p>We decided to have a gelato at the old spot on 22nd Street, and that was a hit for sure. He chose chocolate, to my surprise (not vanilla or coconut) and we sat outside checking out the big steeple on the nearby Chinese temple on the corner, and watching the world go by. We had driven along Mission Street at one point, and Riku commented about how noisy and busy it was, and he doesn't like that so much. He likes things a little more quiet, unless they are people he knows and is involved with, as proved the point later on! </p>
<p>Riku was delighted to find some mail for him waiting at home, a postcard from Auntie Kelly from Vancouver. Before getting back to his shells, he read the whole card on his own. </p>
<p>Tonight is the night that Soo came over to cook dumplings and a meatball dish for some of Bryn's friends... Sean, Judy, Bern, Brent, Mykela, and Quentin. Earlier in the day I wasn't sure if anyone was coming but Soo, but that changed thank goodness, as Riku was so disappointed last night. Bryn and Soo arrived at 6 P.M. and the others drifted in after that. Sean arrived first and Riku was so pleased to have him to himself for a bit; he showed his some whale shots he has on his "favourites" list, and that he can now access without any help. He did insist that we gather 'round to ooh and ahh over the photos. "Isn't that just <strong>gorgeous</strong>?", and "Aren't sunsets sooo beautiful?", Riku commented, also making sure to ask each of us which was our favourite photo. I liked one with a full moon and lots of blue in the sky, and Riku agreed "that is a beautiful one!" </p>
<p>Sean suggested that he and Riku sit at the table and draw, so they did that, and eventually we had six chairs around the little kitchen table, with everyone drawing. It was lots of fun and Riku was in his glory for the entire evening.He loves adult company, and is in his element. Meanwhile, Soo was busy at the counter making dozens of potstickers, none sadly were vegetarian. She brought along the meatball dish that Bryn had requested, and everyone sat at the dining room table, eating happily. Bryn dashed out for some beer, Riku joined in at the table, although he had eaten his dinner, and had his tub, before everyone arrived. </p>
<p>It was a very late night for Riku. At 9:10 I told him he had to say goodnight to everyone, and then he said "How about a picture of everyone first?" Is this my grandchild? Yes! It was such fun that he suggested it, and we got two really fabulous photos of everyone but Bryn! We should have done one before Brent, Mykela, and Quentin left too, but we will no doubt be together again before Bryn and Riku leave. </p>
<p>Riku settled down very quickly, after hugging everyone goodbye. He could hear them in the hallway, but after two Shel Silverstein poems, he was right into our bedtime routine, and he fell asleep with his arm wrapped around my neck. </p>
