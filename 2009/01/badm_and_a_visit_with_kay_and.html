								<h2>BADM and a Visit with Kay and Greg</h2>
								<p>Mirei and I had plans to go to the BADM this morning. Akane had made plans to meet up with her friend Greg and his mother; they were going out for lunch and to run some errands. Just as I was putting Mirei into the car seat, Greg and his mom, Kay, pulled up in front. So, Mirei and I stopped to say goodbye. Kay is a little tiny dumpling of a woman, very vivacious and full of energy. That was obvious immediately. </p>
<p>After a quick chat we all went our separate ways. Of course Mirei had a great time, as she always does. We started off in the toddler zone so she could buzz around like a bee, lounge on the water bed, and climb the play structure with the other children. Then it was lunch time, followed by lots of time painting on the mirrored wall. It wasn't too busy, so Mirei was very happy not to be crowded in as is often the case. And she also had lots of space at the magic sand table. She does like to watch the other children, though, so was happy to be joined by two other little girls. </p>
<p>We had our picnic lunch outside on the deck, and then it was time to climb in and around the boat, climb the hill to ring the bell, and explore the cave and the sandy digging area too. </p>
<p>Akane, Greg, and Kay had just arrived home too, and I invited them to come up for tea. Kay was delighted, I think, and it meant that Riku had some time with them too. Kay drew with the children and had them draw for her. They found her fascinating, as did I, but I went off to bath them and get them ready for bed, leaving Bryn and Akane some quiet time with them. Greg read them a book in the living room before they went off to bed for their tuck-in time stories. </p>
<p>They had decided to order pizza in from "Little Star", so Greg and Bryn went off to pick up their order while I settled in for a long talk with Kay about her fascinating life ... as the beloved child of a father who gave his daughter a very different lifestyle than any of her friends in Japan: she drove his car, acted as his chauffeur, and went along on business trips with him. After the war, he arranged for her to go to an art college in Montr√©al, where she met the Russian student she married. Kay is quite the storyteller, with lots of detail and animation accompanying the stories, and I enjoyed every minute of it. I was happy to ask her lots of questions, as she was very happy sharing her life with me. </p>
<p>We all ate dinner together, and they stayed on much later than Greg had guessed they would. I do hope to meet with Kay again, although she now lives in Tokyo so that's not likely to happen. Kay doesn't use the computer either, so we're not likely to keep in touch. It was such a fun day for me, from start to finish! </p>
