								<h2><a href="/2009/01/january_1st_2009.html">January 1st, 2009</a></h2>
								<p>That's the first time I have typed the new year in, and Riku beat me to it, coming to our room at 7:15, with icy feet!... brrrr!, to hand me his latest drawing, done earlier, with Riku 2009 printed at the top. Mirei joined us in bed too, but she was snuggly warm in her sleepers. It took a long time for those feet of Riku's to thaw; he needs some cozy slippers! </p>
<p>The whole crew here at 1361 gathered for brunch, along with Soo, for a Chinese brunch at 10:30. The children came in our car, but then went off with their parents, aunt, uncle, Soo, and Doug to a Chinese grocery store while I waited for our table. I had twenty minutes on my own, and made a list of fourteen New Year's resolutions. There may be more, but I have covered all the basic things I would like to change, or add to this new year.</p>
<p>Bryn treated us to the delicious meal, and I enjoyed every bite of the four different tofu/tofu skin dishes I ate. Yum!</p>
<p>The children are so happy to have their aunt and uncle with them, and so they sat beside them during the meal, but it was awfully nice to have Riku come to sit on my lap partway through the meal too. I'm happy they're happy, but I miss my little moments with them nonetheless.  </p>
<p>Strange day today, as I didn't have the children outside today for the usual running around/fresh air that I always fit it. Bryn, Akane, and Ayako went over to the apartment to do some clearing/packing up, while Masu stayed here with the children. He was great with them, and they enjoyed their time with him, watching a movie on his computer, building with Riku, and snuggling with Mirei. Riku enjoys his "alone" time too, and when Mirei was with Masu, he built and rearranged his Lego figures in his room. </p>
<p>I took some time to read in my room on my own while the children were occupied, and then got busy unpacking bags of various things that Bryn brought over in several trips. This house is bursting at the seams, but it will all be taken care of over the next few weeks. </p>
<p>There was time for a longish chat with Kelly, some photo time on the computer, and wading through the photos on Doug's computer which will be blog photos soon. </p>
<p>Tub time for the children at 4:30... more play time, dinner time, and then Mirei opened a baby doll from Doug and me... she still hasn't opened birthday gifts from the family.  We hope to do this really soon... and stop her somehow from thinking she will be four when she does! </p>
<p>I got to snuggle and read with Riku in a chair in the living room, Christmas tree softly glowing, as Mirei had trouble falling asleep tonight. I ended up lying with him on the sofa, and he wondered if we could sleep there all night for a special treat. He fell asleep so quickly, looking so sweet, and so much younger than six (I could see that baby face in him tonight);  I would have loved to have done his bidding, but it's just too narrow for two of us. </p>
<p>Such a shame, as Mirei kicks out in the early morning, waking him too early, not a fun way for anyone to start their day. Mirei wakens earlier too, knowing that Riku is right there in the bed with her, and she is ready to get on with her day before Riku is. </p>
<p>Quiet evening for me, as Akane, Bryn, Masu, and Ayako left for dinner at 8:30, returning two hours later, and Doug went up to bed at 9:45 to read. I wrote to Uncle Frank, checked my Facebook messages, and headed up to bed myself just before 11 o'clock.  </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/01/obama_patrizia_and_family_and.html">Obama!, Patrizia and Family, and Ocean Beach... What a Day!</a></h2>
								<p>Today started off as a very eventful one, as Barack Obama was sworn in as President of the United States of America. Doug listened to his acceptance speech on the radio as he drove Mirei to Little Angels, and Riku and I watched it on Doug's computer as we waited for Doug's return. Riku was totally involved in the whole procedure, asking me to point out President Bush, and showing great interest in the bodyguards, the bands ("I like the music!") and later on wanting to know all about Ted Kennedy and his collapse... why did it happen, what happened, how he was, was he going to die, etc. etc. </p>
<p>Today one of my doula moms, her husband, and one-year-old child are moving to Italy, Patrizia's original home. A young woman, Cara, who co-doula-ed with me for Patrizia's birth was a few minutes late picking me up to visit with Patrizia and Ehecatl, as she too wanted to see Obama's speech. We spent an hour and a half admiring Ehecatl's new walking skills(!), and catching up with our lives. We will all be staying in touch, as Cara too is off for some adventures, to Pakistan, and Denmark, after an interview in Connecticut for a nurse/midwifery position. It was hard to say goodbye at 10:30, but emails and Skype will be a huge plus, especially watching Ehecatl grow and change. </p>
<p>Riku and I picked Mirei up at school at 1 o'clock and headed out to Ocean Beach. It could not have been a more perfect January day for the beach... warm enough that the children could take off their slacks and run in and out of the water... at the edge... and yet not so warm that we worried about getting too much sun. We had arranged to meet Susan and the children there, and not too long after we got settled in the damp sand area, Amelia ran down the beach to join us. Finn was sleeping in the car, with Susan reading, and I took dozens and dozens of photos of the children playing in the mud holes nicely provided by the tide today, and just having a blast! </p>
<p>Susan and Finn joined us, and he had some time in the mud too. We stayed an hour later than I intended to, but it was just too hard to leave. It really was the best day of the week! </p>
<p>Riku did his piano practice while I had a cup of hot tea, Mirei played quietly in the room, and then after that came tub time for them both, dinner ( homemade mac' and cheese and veggies), and a few pages of English homework for Riku. At 6:15, Mirei said "I am tired. I want to go to bed now" and refused to eat another bite. She was asleep within five minutes, or less(!), of my turning out the light. </p>
<p>Bryn tucked Riku in, after Riku read to him, and Riku got to hear two new books sent out by Kelly and Gregg, one of which was meant for Mirei I learned the next morning. Bryn fell asleep with him, not intentionally, and I gave up trying to waken him after four attempts to do so. I went through a ton of photos from the past few days... I'm way behind in my blog photos! </p>
<p>I am off to sleep with Mirei, a rare event, as she has been sleeping with her Daddy except for the first two nights of Akane's time away.  </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/01/mirei_catches_up_on_the_latest.html">Mirei Catches up on the Latest News, My Helper, A Crissy Field Trip, and Pregnant? Riku!</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei slept in until 7:45 this morning! Riku and I had lots of time to just relax after he woke at 6:45; he had his fruit bowl and drew, I packed his lunch, and then Bryn and Mirei joined him at the table. Doug walked Riku to school this morning, which meant I could have a longer than usual leisurely shower once they left. However, I was still in my dressing gown at one point, while Mirei was eating and she looked over at me and said, "You need to get dressed Missy."(!) This made me laugh out loud so hard, as she sounded just like me! </p>
<p>I joined her at the table, and we read the paper together. Riku too likes to do this on days he is not in school, and always asks "What's happening?" Mirei just takes a section of the paper, and struggles with the size of it, as she maneuvers it around to check out everything of interest on the page. Today, of course, Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, were on the front page, so she paid more attention than usual to the cover story. </p>
<p>Mirei was happy to watch Caillou while I showered but once I was out, even though I had the hair dryer going, she asked me to leave the bathroom door open. She's a little nervous about being upstairs "on her own", as it seems the big Buddha statue unnerves her a little. I showed it to her and patted his flat belly, and touched it, and that seemed to help a bit, but still... that open door just reassures her that little bit for her comfort level. </p>
<p>After I showered and dressed, we went downstairs and got to work in the kitchen, with Mirei once again helping me with the dishwasher, loading this day. She really wants to do it alone, and if I show her how a cup or bowl goes, she insists on taking it out and doing it herself. "There you go!" says Mirei! </p>
<p>Doug left at 9:30 to join Riku's class and the kindergarten one (Ms. To's, his former teacher) at Crissy Field, near the Golden Gate Bridge. They explored and counted birds, and observed, all with clip boards to write down their numbers and observations. I had packed a lunch for them both, which they ate inside, with two Rangers telling them lots of interesting bits about what they were seeing. Riku told Doug he wanted to go back on the weekend, so we shall do this, as I haven't been to this area either. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mirei and I headed off on the bus at 11:30 to join them an hour later at a pediatric dermatologist. Riku has had bumps on his bottom for far too long and despite seeing two doctors about it, and having them clear up somewhat both times, they just won't go away completely. Mirei enjoyed the bus trips (we had to transfer once) very much and sat on the window side asking lots of questions. Just as we got off the bus, we spotted Doug and Riku in the car; we waited while they parked and I wish I had had my camera ready to take a photo of the two children running towards each other once they spotted each other on the street. Adorable! </p>
<p>Riku's appointment lasted an hour, and he had to get into a hospital gown for the first time ever. There was a mirror in the room, so he made good use of it, checking himself out. At one point he pushed his tummy way way out and leaned back, looking as pregnant as could be. And then he posed again, saying he pushed the baby out really fast(!) and showed me his flat tummy. If only that did the trick! </p>
<p>Riku saw two doctors, one a young intern, before seeing the specialist, and it was confirmed that he has a type of wart problem, very common, and as the eczema around it had cleared up, thanks to the diligent treatment over the past week or so of more frequent usage of a stronger cortisone, the area looked good except for these now small and dry red bumps. They painted on a treatment, which was painless, and he will develop an immune reaction to them, so we won't see them again. There is a good chance that Mirei had them last summer, and she too is now immune. Whew! They all checked out his skin and remarked on how clear and soft it was, with no signs of eczema at all. </p>
<p>Riku had some playing time with Mirei once we got home, and then Mirei joined me on the bed (I made myself a hot cup of tea), while Riku played the piano for a half hour. He learned a fun exercise at school that he can play from heart, which he knows I like to hear each time. Then it was tub time, and then dinner. Riku had asked me for "mac and cheese, the kind you gave us when Mirei and I watched TV" and somehow I thought he meant a frozen "Amy's" I had bought once a while back. So, I made up a homemade macaroni and cheese, done on the stovetop from scratch, that I thought would be just the ticket. He was so disappointed, telling me that wasn't what he meant, but the one I had given them just two days ago, from a box of organic macaroni mix down with orange cheddar, and not the white cheddar I usually buy! However, he ate it and I'm sure that gave him the energy he needed to get through the few pages of Chinese homework he had left to do! </p>
<p>Riku was tucked in and asleep by 7:30, almost an hour after his sister, who was out like a light once more. She actually said at the table that she was tired and wanted to go to bed, and that was at 6:15! Mirei is sleeping twelve plus hours these days! </p>
<p>Bryn left at 6:30 for dinner at Brent's to celebrate a co-worker's birthday, arriving home just as I was ready to head for bed, more tired than usual for some reason.  </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/01/badm_and_a_visit_with_kay_and.html">BADM and a Visit with Kay and Greg</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei and I had plans to go to the BADM this morning. Akane had made plans to meet up with her friend Greg and his mother; they were going out for lunch and to run some errands. Just as I was putting Mirei into the car seat, Greg and his mom, Kay, pulled up in front. So, Mirei and I stopped to say goodbye. Kay is a little tiny dumpling of a woman, very vivacious and full of energy. That was obvious immediately. </p>
<p>After a quick chat we all went our separate ways. Of course Mirei had a great time, as she always does. We started off in the toddler zone so she could buzz around like a bee, lounge on the water bed, and climb the play structure with the other children. Then it was lunch time, followed by lots of time painting on the mirrored wall. It wasn't too busy, so Mirei was very happy not to be crowded in as is often the case. And she also had lots of space at the magic sand table. She does like to watch the other children, though, so was happy to be joined by two other little girls. </p>
<p>We had our picnic lunch outside on the deck, and then it was time to climb in and around the boat, climb the hill to ring the bell, and explore the cave and the sandy digging area too. </p>
<p>Akane, Greg, and Kay had just arrived home too, and I invited them to come up for tea. Kay was delighted, I think, and it meant that Riku had some time with them too. Kay drew with the children and had them draw for her. They found her fascinating, as did I, but I went off to bath them and get them ready for bed, leaving Bryn and Akane some quiet time with them. Greg read them a book in the living room before they went off to bed for their tuck-in time stories. </p>
<p>They had decided to order pizza in from "Little Star", so Greg and Bryn went off to pick up their order while I settled in for a long talk with Kay about her fascinating life ... as the beloved child of a father who gave his daughter a very different lifestyle than any of her friends in Japan: she drove his car, acted as his chauffeur, and went along on business trips with him. After the war, he arranged for her to go to an art college in Montréal, where she met the Russian student she married. Kay is quite the storyteller, with lots of detail and animation accompanying the stories, and I enjoyed every minute of it. I was happy to ask her lots of questions, as she was very happy sharing her life with me. </p>
<p>We all ate dinner together, and they stayed on much later than Greg had guessed they would. I do hope to meet with Kay again, although she now lives in Tokyo so that's not likely to happen. Kay doesn't use the computer either, so we're not likely to keep in touch. It was such a fun day for me, from start to finish! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/01/off_to_the_zoo_today_with_mire.html">Off to the Zoo Today with Mirei</a></h2>
								<p>It was another sunny cold morning here; Bryn called from his cell phone to let us know it was brisk out, so Riku wore a scarf to school, and knowing it would warm up later on, I wore it home. Birds were singing loudly on the street above us, and Riku and I had a long conversation about birds in trees. I told him how we had a very big tree outside our bedroom window when I was growing up, and how my sisters and I would lie in bed listening to all of them singing. </p>
<p>There were birds flitting here and there on our way up the hills; we listened to them, and admired the little laurel tree once more that is Riku's favourite. I pointed out my favourite purple flowers and before we knew it we were at school, arriving just as the bell rang. </p>
<p>I had promised Mirei we would go to the zoo today, so after eating breakfast and "reading" the paper with Mirei, I packed up a lunch for her, and off we went with Grandpa. On the way there, not long after leaving the house, Mirei put her head to one side of her car seat and said "I'm tired." I was teasing her and said "No, don't go to sleep! We are going to the zoo. Open your blue eyes!" to which she said "I have brown eyes, but I'm tired." A minute later she yawned, and then said again "I am tired. See, I just yawned."! We laughed, as we had never heard that from her before. The sun was in Mirei's eyes, which doesn't help with keeping her eyes open, but she didn't nap after all, and we were at the zoo in twenty minutes. </p>
<p>I had a jacket and scarf ready for Mirei, and had added a second top to her skimpy little one, but of course Mirei rejected the extra layers, and was perfectly comfortable without them. This child is like her cousin Caillie and just does not feel the cold like the rest of us. Even Riku and Bryn will dress more warmly than their sisters. </p>
<p>We had a grand time at the zoo, heading first to the meercats and groundhog area, where Mirei and one of the groundhogs took stock of each other. </p>
<p>Then it was off to the barnyard. Even though Mirei quite likes the idea of sheep and goats, she doesn't any of them sneaking up behind her, or surprising her with a gentle butt of the head either. She makes sure that either Grandpa or me is right there to rescue her, but loves to pat them and/or brush them if they stand nice and still. </p>
<p>Mirei just ran and ran and ran today, spending much of her time racing ahead of us and calling out "I winned" until she learned to say "I won!" instead. We went through two tunnels and she made huge whooping noises, along with us, just for the sheer thrill of hearing her voice come booming back at her. She stopped long enough to admire the giraffes, and to feel sorry for the lone gorilla out on his own today. </p>
<p>Mirei is her Nana's child in that she is almost as much interested in watching and listening to the humans as watching the animals! She always takes a good look at whatever creature is close by, and then turns to stare at the other people doing the same thing. It's funny to see, and we often have to take her hand to get her moving along to the next group... of people! </p>
<p>We ended our two and a half hours here today with a ride on the carousel, with a promise to go on again the next time. Akane had picked Riku up from school today, so he was standing at the top of the stairs and ready with big hugs for us all when we reached the landing. They had a snack together before Riku went up to do his piano practicing, and Mirei joined them for a bit while I had a hot cup of tea. </p>
<p>Riku had two letters in the mail today, thank you cards from Bryn and Caillie for the book marks he made for them at Christmas. He sat reading them both, delighted to have them and he learned to use the letter opener as well. There is no homework for Riku this week, such a pleasure(!), and so the children sat and drew, and then had tub time with me watching, while Akane made dinner. </p>
<p>Doug and I left at 6:15 for a book reading at "M is for Mystery" in San Mateo. Doug commented on the way there that he could hardly believe we were actually going out together in the evening, and he was right... it has been a long time since we have done so! I enjoyed sitting and working on my calendar before the reading, and even though I enjoyed the reading very much, I could feel how tired I was. At home I would have been buzzing about, or working on the computer, but just sitting quietly made me realize just how good it was to just sit. </p>
<p>I answered a few emails when I got home, but heated up my bed buddies and headed for bed at 10 o'clock with plans to have the light out at 10:30, which I did! </p>
