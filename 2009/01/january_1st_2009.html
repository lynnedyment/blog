								<h2>January 1st, 2009</h2>
								<p>That's the first time I have typed the new year in, and Riku beat me to it, coming to our room at 7:15, with icy feet!... brrrr!, to hand me his latest drawing, done earlier, with Riku 2009 printed at the top. Mirei joined us in bed too, but she was snuggly warm in her sleepers. It took a long time for those feet of Riku's to thaw; he needs some cozy slippers! </p>
<p>The whole crew here at 1361 gathered for brunch, along with Soo, for a Chinese brunch at 10:30. The children came in our car, but then went off with their parents, aunt, uncle, Soo, and Doug to a Chinese grocery store while I waited for our table. I had twenty minutes on my own, and made a list of fourteen New Year's resolutions. There may be more, but I have covered all the basic things I would like to change, or add to this new year.</p>
<p>Bryn treated us to the delicious meal, and I enjoyed every bite of the four different tofu/tofu skin dishes I ate. Yum!</p>
<p>The children are so happy to have their aunt and uncle with them, and so they sat beside them during the meal, but it was awfully nice to have Riku come to sit on my lap partway through the meal too. I'm happy they're happy, but I miss my little moments with them nonetheless.  </p>
<p>Strange day today, as I didn't have the children outside today for the usual running around/fresh air that I always fit it. Bryn, Akane, and Ayako went over to the apartment to do some clearing/packing up, while Masu stayed here with the children. He was great with them, and they enjoyed their time with him, watching a movie on his computer, building with Riku, and snuggling with Mirei. Riku enjoys his "alone" time too, and when Mirei was with Masu, he built and rearranged his Lego figures in his room. </p>
<p>I took some time to read in my room on my own while the children were occupied, and then got busy unpacking bags of various things that Bryn brought over in several trips. This house is bursting at the seams, but it will all be taken care of over the next few weeks. </p>
<p>There was time for a longish chat with Kelly, some photo time on the computer, and wading through the photos on Doug's computer which will be blog photos soon. </p>
<p>Tub time for the children at 4:30... more play time, dinner time, and then Mirei opened a baby doll from Doug and me... she still hasn't opened birthday gifts from the family.  We hope to do this really soon... and stop her somehow from thinking she will be four when she does! </p>
<p>I got to snuggle and read with Riku in a chair in the living room, Christmas tree softly glowing, as Mirei had trouble falling asleep tonight. I ended up lying with him on the sofa, and he wondered if we could sleep there all night for a special treat. He fell asleep so quickly, looking so sweet, and so much younger than six (I could see that baby face in him tonight);  I would have loved to have done his bidding, but it's just too narrow for two of us. </p>
<p>Such a shame, as Mirei kicks out in the early morning, waking him too early, not a fun way for anyone to start their day. Mirei wakens earlier too, knowing that Riku is right there in the bed with her, and she is ready to get on with her day before Riku is. </p>
<p>Quiet evening for me, as Akane, Bryn, Masu, and Ayako left for dinner at 8:30, returning two hours later, and Doug went up to bed at 9:45 to read. I wrote to Uncle Frank, checked my Facebook messages, and headed up to bed myself just before 11 o'clock.  </p>
