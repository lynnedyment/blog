								<h2>Off to the Zoo Today with Mirei</h2>
								<p>It was another sunny cold morning here; Bryn called from his cell phone to let us know it was brisk out, so Riku wore a scarf to school, and knowing it would warm up later on, I wore it home. Birds were singing loudly on the street above us, and Riku and I had a long conversation about birds in trees. I told him how we had a very big tree outside our bedroom window when I was growing up, and how my sisters and I would lie in bed listening to all of them singing. </p>
<p>There were birds flitting here and there on our way up the hills; we listened to them, and admired the little laurel tree once more that is Riku's favourite. I pointed out my favourite purple flowers and before we knew it we were at school, arriving just as the bell rang. </p>
<p>I had promised Mirei we would go to the zoo today, so after eating breakfast and "reading" the paper with Mirei, I packed up a lunch for her, and off we went with Grandpa. On the way there, not long after leaving the house, Mirei put her head to one side of her car seat and said "I'm tired." I was teasing her and said "No, don't go to sleep! We are going to the zoo. Open your blue eyes!" to which she said "I have brown eyes, but I'm tired." A minute later she yawned, and then said again "I am tired. See, I just yawned."! We laughed, as we had never heard that from her before. The sun was in Mirei's eyes, which doesn't help with keeping her eyes open, but she didn't nap after all, and we were at the zoo in twenty minutes. </p>
<p>I had a jacket and scarf ready for Mirei, and had added a second top to her skimpy little one, but of course Mirei rejected the extra layers, and was perfectly comfortable without them. This child is like her cousin Caillie and just does not feel the cold like the rest of us. Even Riku and Bryn will dress more warmly than their sisters. </p>
<p>We had a grand time at the zoo, heading first to the meercats and groundhog area, where Mirei and one of the groundhogs took stock of each other. </p>
<p>Then it was off to the barnyard. Even though Mirei quite likes the idea of sheep and goats, she doesn't any of them sneaking up behind her, or surprising her with a gentle butt of the head either. She makes sure that either Grandpa or me is right there to rescue her, but loves to pat them and/or brush them if they stand nice and still. </p>
<p>Mirei just ran and ran and ran today, spending much of her time racing ahead of us and calling out "I winned" until she learned to say "I won!" instead. We went through two tunnels and she made huge whooping noises, along with us, just for the sheer thrill of hearing her voice come booming back at her. She stopped long enough to admire the giraffes, and to feel sorry for the lone gorilla out on his own today. </p>
<p>Mirei is her Nana's child in that she is almost as much interested in watching and listening to the humans as watching the animals! She always takes a good look at whatever creature is close by, and then turns to stare at the other people doing the same thing. It's funny to see, and we often have to take her hand to get her moving along to the next group... of people! </p>
<p>We ended our two and a half hours here today with a ride on the carousel, with a promise to go on again the next time. Akane had picked Riku up from school today, so he was standing at the top of the stairs and ready with big hugs for us all when we reached the landing. They had a snack together before Riku went up to do his piano practicing, and Mirei joined them for a bit while I had a hot cup of tea. </p>
<p>Riku had two letters in the mail today, thank you cards from Bryn and Caillie for the book marks he made for them at Christmas. He sat reading them both, delighted to have them and he learned to use the letter opener as well. There is no homework for Riku this week, such a pleasure(!), and so the children sat and drew, and then had tub time with me watching, while Akane made dinner. </p>
<p>Doug and I left at 6:15 for a book reading at "M is for Mystery" in San Mateo. Doug commented on the way there that he could hardly believe we were actually going out together in the evening, and he was right... it has been a long time since we have done so! I enjoyed sitting and working on my calendar before the reading, and even though I enjoyed the reading very much, I could feel how tired I was. At home I would have been buzzing about, or working on the computer, but just sitting quietly made me realize just how good it was to just sit. </p>
<p>I answered a few emails when I got home, but heated up my bed buddies and headed for bed at 10 o'clock with plans to have the light out at 10:30, which I did! </p>
