								<h2>Mirei Catches up on the Latest News, My Helper, A Crissy Field Trip, and Pregnant? Riku!</h2>
								<p>Mirei slept in until 7:45 this morning! Riku and I had lots of time to just relax after he woke at 6:45; he had his fruit bowl and drew, I packed his lunch, and then Bryn and Mirei joined him at the table. Doug walked Riku to school this morning, which meant I could have a longer than usual leisurely shower once they left. However, I was still in my dressing gown at one point, while Mirei was eating and she looked over at me and said, "You need to get dressed Missy."(!) This made me laugh out loud so hard, as she sounded just like me! </p>
<p>I joined her at the table, and we read the paper together. Riku too likes to do this on days he is not in school, and always asks "What's happening?" Mirei just takes a section of the paper, and struggles with the size of it, as she maneuvers it around to check out everything of interest on the page. Today, of course, Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, were on the front page, so she paid more attention than usual to the cover story. </p>
<p>Mirei was happy to watch Caillou while I showered but once I was out, even though I had the hair dryer going, she asked me to leave the bathroom door open. She's a little nervous about being upstairs "on her own", as it seems the big Buddha statue unnerves her a little. I showed it to her and patted his flat belly, and touched it, and that seemed to help a bit, but still... that open door just reassures her that little bit for her comfort level. </p>
<p>After I showered and dressed, we went downstairs and got to work in the kitchen, with Mirei once again helping me with the dishwasher, loading this day. She really wants to do it alone, and if I show her how a cup or bowl goes, she insists on taking it out and doing it herself. "There you go!" says Mirei! </p>
<p>Doug left at 9:30 to join Riku's class and the kindergarten one (Ms. To's, his former teacher) at Crissy Field, near the Golden Gate Bridge. They explored and counted birds, and observed, all with clip boards to write down their numbers and observations. I had packed a lunch for them both, which they ate inside, with two Rangers telling them lots of interesting bits about what they were seeing. Riku told Doug he wanted to go back on the weekend, so we shall do this, as I haven't been to this area either. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mirei and I headed off on the bus at 11:30 to join them an hour later at a pediatric dermatologist. Riku has had bumps on his bottom for far too long and despite seeing two doctors about it, and having them clear up somewhat both times, they just won't go away completely. Mirei enjoyed the bus trips (we had to transfer once) very much and sat on the window side asking lots of questions. Just as we got off the bus, we spotted Doug and Riku in the car; we waited while they parked and I wish I had had my camera ready to take a photo of the two children running towards each other once they spotted each other on the street. Adorable! </p>
<p>Riku's appointment lasted an hour, and he had to get into a hospital gown for the first time ever. There was a mirror in the room, so he made good use of it, checking himself out. At one point he pushed his tummy way way out and leaned back, looking as pregnant as could be. And then he posed again, saying he pushed the baby out really fast(!) and showed me his flat tummy. If only that did the trick! </p>
<p>Riku saw two doctors, one a young intern, before seeing the specialist, and it was confirmed that he has a type of wart problem, very common, and as the eczema around it had cleared up, thanks to the diligent treatment over the past week or so of more frequent usage of a stronger cortisone, the area looked good except for these now small and dry red bumps. They painted on a treatment, which was painless, and he will develop an immune reaction to them, so we won't see them again. There is a good chance that Mirei had them last summer, and she too is now immune. Whew! They all checked out his skin and remarked on how clear and soft it was, with no signs of eczema at all. </p>
<p>Riku had some playing time with Mirei once we got home, and then Mirei joined me on the bed (I made myself a hot cup of tea), while Riku played the piano for a half hour. He learned a fun exercise at school that he can play from heart, which he knows I like to hear each time. Then it was tub time, and then dinner. Riku had asked me for "mac and cheese, the kind you gave us when Mirei and I watched TV" and somehow I thought he meant a frozen "Amy's" I had bought once a while back. So, I made up a homemade macaroni and cheese, done on the stovetop from scratch, that I thought would be just the ticket. He was so disappointed, telling me that wasn't what he meant, but the one I had given them just two days ago, from a box of organic macaroni mix down with orange cheddar, and not the white cheddar I usually buy! However, he ate it and I'm sure that gave him the energy he needed to get through the few pages of Chinese homework he had left to do! </p>
<p>Riku was tucked in and asleep by 7:30, almost an hour after his sister, who was out like a light once more. She actually said at the table that she was tired and wanted to go to bed, and that was at 6:15! Mirei is sleeping twelve plus hours these days! </p>
<p>Bryn left at 6:30 for dinner at Brent's to celebrate a co-worker's birthday, arriving home just as I was ready to head for bed, more tired than usual for some reason.  </p>
