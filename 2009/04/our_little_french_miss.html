								<h2>Our Little French Miss!</h2>
								<p>My days are settling into a routine, with the mornings helping with the children as they prepare for their school day, and then my walk to school with Riku, my walk home, and some puttering about the house. Akane is off taking Mirei to school, and usually stays out for most of the day. Bryn is working, we have some breakfast, he washes the dishes and I dry them, and the morning slips by. </p>
<p>I took a photo of Riku and his classmates being walked to the crosswalk today. Riku spotted me and gave me a big smile. We hold hands and chat all the way home. He doesn't talk about school so much, but about what he wants to do or what he was thinking about. It's hard to get any information out of his about what he does with his time there! </p>
<p>We do pass some interesting houses on the way home, and over the course of my time here, I will include some of them in my blogs. Today we passed a shrine outside a house, and Riku quite liked the little apron-like cloth covering most of it. </p>
<p>Riku is always ready for lunch, even after eating his little cheese cracker snacks (brought from San Francisco) on the way home. Then he's ready for some quiet time in the house for a while. Today that didn't last long and he was most anxious to get to the playground. Bryn and Akane had gone out for a noodle lunch, so I did up the few dishes, made myself a small thermos of tea, and off we went. It's hot in the afternoon, and Riku had his new hat on to keep the sun off his face. Our usual bench was busy with moms and toddlers so we chose a bench at the side of the play area today, a good spot for Riku to watch the baseball players, rescue a couple of balls for them, and water the dry bushes with a bottle he found. He had some big drinks of water, went down the slide a few times, and picked me some wild flowers. </p>
<p>He had a piano lesson scheduled for 4:30 today, a try-out session to see if it would be a good fit between him and the teacher. So, Bryn and I left the house to pick Mirei up from her Ecole Francais today. It was my first time on the bus here, and the drive further south into Kyoto was interesting, with the usual mixes of ugly new buildings tucked behind tiny wooden structures, lots of overhead wiring, beautiful blossoming cherry trees in varying hues of pink/white, and a lot of Caucasian tourists here for those blooms. It's about a five minute walk to the bus stop, and we had to wait five minutes for the bus, but we arrived at the school at five minutes past four, despite our having left a bit late. </p>
<p>I had heard so much about Mirei's handsome male teacher, and he is indeed. Mirei came out onto the porch smiling her big smile and Bryn had some time to talk to him about their routine. It's a busy day with playtime, outdoor play, painting/drawing, and a one hour nap following lunch. They do waken the children at 2, but that hour makes it hard for Mirei to settle in as early as she should. Akane had told us she would be hungry when she got out, so we stopped in at "Petit PÃ¢tisserie" for a snack for her. She chose a round "pizza" and amazed us both with how quickly she ate it at the bus stop! </p>
<p>Of course she gets much attention on the bus, as she is so vocal, very inquisitive, and not always the quietest little girl. Women especially respond to her though in a very positive way, smiling at her, and a few of them spoke to her as well. The bus was crowded, but a kind woman offered us her seat, which meant Mirei could see out the window and comment on ever so many things. There was a woman sitting next to us, who asked where we were from. I told her Mirei was born in Japan but had been living in SF until last month. She volunteered that her daughter lives in Washington, and that she had been there to see the cherry blossoms in that city last year. Another daughter is pregnant and living nearby and she is most anxious to be a grandmother. </p>
<p>Tonight while Mirei was sitting on my bed, playing with her dolls, I heard her counting in French to them ... un, deux, trois. </p>
<p>Riku's piano lesson went very well and he will be going for classes every Thursday right after school. He liked the teacher, and seemed happy about his class. </p>
<p>It was late by the time they got home, so Akane made udon noodles with veggies and fish cake for the children, I tubbed them both, and Riku was sound asleep at 7:45, after one chapter.  I woke at 8:10, having decided to just lie beside him for a minute, but awoke thinking it must be an hour later. I like these long lazy days! </p>
<p>Akane tucked in Mirei, and that was the last we saw of her for the night! We could hear Mirei chattering away just as she did for Bryn the night before, when he fell asleep with her! </p>
<p>Eventually, Bryn and I did the dishes, and after answering just a couple of emails, I decided to work on my family tree for a while. It was very relaxing and I happily turned in to read at 10:30.</p>
