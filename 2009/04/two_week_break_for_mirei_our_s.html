								<h2>Two Week Break for Mirei, Our Snowman Woman, Space, and Black Holes!</h2>
								<p>It's Monday and the first week day off for Mirei since I arrived. We will have lots of hours to spend together, and I am a little worried about how to fill in the hours without my usual array of things we did in San Francisco. We were lucky and I know it with so many fun and interesting playgrounds close by, Mirei's favourite Bay Area Discovery Museum, and the beaches. And Mirei was always happy playing with anything at all i the back garden too, riding her tricycle, picking up rocks, helping me weed and sweep, etc. etc. </p>
<p>However, it's the first day and it was fun just not having to say a quick goodbye to her as I dashed out the door with Riku! After eating the third portion of her breakfast with a video playing (a rare treat for her... she watched Caillou in German!, the only language Akane could find of the particular Caillou episode Mirei decided she wanted to watch), off we went for a walk to the local shopping area. </p>
<p>After checking out the slowly filling pea pods, we were lucky enough to spot our favourite "local", the woman we now call the "snowman" lady, because of the snowmen marching around her skirt. Today, however, she was wearing a long skirt made up of crocheted squares. Quite the colorful character! She kindly allowed me to take a photo of her with Mirei. We were out for a full hour, heading home before the rain hit. We made it, but the clothes on the line got wet and then dry again when the sun came out later. </p>
<p>Akane made a curry dish for Mirei today, and Mirei got right to work polishing it off, enjoying every bite of it. And then Akane sat down at the table with her own bowl of noodles and veggies, and that looked much more appealing to Miss Mirei. I took a series of photos showing every step of this funny scenario... Mirei peering into Akane's bowl, looking sad at her own bowl, smiling her big smile when the trade was made, enjoying the new dish, and then going through the whole routine again until she was back to her own curry. What a character she is! </p>
<p>Riku was home long enough to do his piano practice, have a snack, and so do some spelling with Bryn before leaving with Akane for a doctor's appointment. Mirei and I decided to walk with them for two blocks, and then continue on, but this little girl just burst into tears when she saw them turn off in a different direction. She was tired, and it showed, as she sat right down in the middle of the "sidewalk" refusing to move. Her nose was running, but she wouldn't let me wipe it, she went "boneless" on me, and just cried and cried. Eventually she agreed to let me carry her home, and was her perky happy self in no time. </p>
<p>Riku has a sinus infection and was given some antibiotics and a one-a-day allergy tablet. He and Mirei had a little time together and spent some time pretending that Riku was showing Mirei something on a computer at "Grandpa's house". </p>
<p>Tub time right after dinner, and then an early bed for them both. Akane had bought Riku a book about space, written in Japanese, so we had a good look at that before he was tucked in. </p>
