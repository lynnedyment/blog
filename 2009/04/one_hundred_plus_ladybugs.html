								<h2>One Hundred Plus Ladybugs!</h2>
								<p>Yup, that's right! Even though there wasn't much dew today, the ladybugs were out in full force. Riku was counting them as fast as he could, as we moved along that last long stretch, but really hit the big time when we discovered them cozily hidden in the curve of a metal barrier that divides the road and sidewalk on the lane into the school. They were mostly congregated near the ends, and when it became obvious that we didn't have time to count them all we decided "over a hundred" in total was a good, if low, estimate. Happy boy! </p>
<p>The principal of the school is often at the gate to meet and greet the students that come in from our direction. He seems to be a very kind and gentle man, and has a big smile and cheery "good morning" for all of us. He always makes an extra comment to the younger children too, and Riku likes him very much. Today, since there were no children directly behind us, I asked if I could take Riku's photo with him; he agreed immediately and knelt down beside Riku, resulting in a very sweet pic;. </p>
<p>I had a little emailing time after my breakfast, before Akane got home from her morning trip to Mirei's school, and then did some unpacking and moving of boxes. There have been two in the dining room since the last big sorting through, and today I was determined to have no boxes left on this floor. Getting one huge box mostly unpacked and sorted in the current "storage room", really a fourth bedroom, was worth doing, as slowly but surely that room is looking bigger and emptier. </p>
<p>Bryn walked over to a favourite cafe to work for two hours this morning; he finds he gets more done without an Internet connection, and he likes to get out of the house too, and see a little bit of the world in his neighbourhood. </p>
<p>I have had two long narrow but quite thick wooden boards leaning against the wall in my room, along with two wooden bases in another spot. These came from an alteration shop that Akane knew of, and when they were renovating she got what used to be the "table" the owner worked on. The idea was to use it all for a coffee table in the living room, so I asked her if we could see if that was going to work. We fiddled around with it for a bit, and after Bryn got home, we all had the hot stir-fried lunch Akane prepared for us, Bryn did some more fiddling and came up with a very reasonable solution. It's stable, it's interesting, and it's functional too! I like old wood, and think it looks great. Now there is a place to put up our feet and a spot for a cup of tea. </p>
<p>Riku's piano lesson was today after school, so Akane went off to meet him. I know he was looking forward to walking home without a grown-up today, but I had forgotten to remind him about his lesson when I left him this morning. They were walking in the house, just as I walked out to pick up Mirei. </p>
<p>It's such a treat to see that sunny little face. She looks so little compared to the really big kids who go there, right up to high school age. There she was wearing her pink backpack, her sweet flowered pink jacket, clutching a small bag, just bursting to show me what was in it ... three bakery treats from a little girl in her class! The teacher had a newly planted bulb, just showing green above the top of the tall plastic cup it was in, ready to hand to her, and another teacher, or perhaps an aide, handed her a painting/pasting/cutting page she had done. Such a lot of fun projects for her. </p>
<p>As usual, we stopped in to buy her pizza round, caught the bus almost immediately, and sat side by side on the back seat of the bus again, but sadly did not see our "friend" or have any interesting interactions with anyone today. There was lots to see out the window though, and she was totally fascinated with the shaven head of the man in front of us! He obviously didn't speak any English or he would have been reacting to some of her comments! </p>
<p>Akane was cooking dinner when we walked in, but Mirei had to show her and daddy all her schoolwork, and tell them about her painting. And then she had to do her homework. Really! She knew she had to do it, and insisted on doing it <strong>now</strong>! Mirei is an old hand at this particular exercise; she has to trace over the letters of six different words, but instead of Japanese words, as they were at "Little Angels", they are French words. I took lots of photos of her working her way through them, and it's too cute for words. </p>
<p>We had a delicious cabbage and veg' stir-fry for dinner, mine with tofu, and the others with sausage. Riku is always happy with fruit for dessert and tonight had strawberries and pineapple, while our girl with the very sweet tooth had ice cream on a stick with chocolate bits in it. Riku had done his English spelling words with Bryn while we were out, and played the piano while his dad videoed him. Lovely.</p>
<p>Tub time, reading time for Mirei with Bryn, and Riku with me ... and he was sound asleep at 7:30 tonight. </p>
<p>It's 9:30. Bryn went to bed at 9, with his alarm set for 2:45 A.M.! Akane must have fallen asleep with Mirei, and I am going to go through some photos for the second time today before I too head off to bed. </p>
<p>p.s. The landscape photo shows Riku's school on the far left side with the playground surrounded by high fencing. I hadn't noticed the rock wall before near the front of the gardens, and quite liked it.</p>
