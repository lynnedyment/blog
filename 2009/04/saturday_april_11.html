								<h2>At Home</h2>
								<p>Ah, Saturday! Riku got to spend his early morning in his very favourite way, snuggled up reading beside me. He is such a reader and if we aren't reading together he is going through his books on his own. Mirei joined us in bed too, and we had a lovely slow beginning to our day. After breakfast, Riku and Akane headed out for an Chinese evaluation class for Riku. He spent one and a half school years, plus summer school last year, working hard on that language. He's good at it, has a good ear, and enjoyed learning it, so it would be a shame for him to lose it at this stage. It seems there may be one boy in his class, as they seem to be at the same level. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mirei was keeping busy around the house, using her Daddy as a table at one point, doing a puzzle, and we read some books together. She loves to "do my homework" too, and draw and colour so our time passed quickly. I hung up some laundry, a "chore" that isn't a chore at all; I enjoy it all... hanging up the clothes in the tiny back yard, watching them blow in the light breeze, and bringing them in to fold, smelling that nothing-like-it long remembered smell. </p>
<p>While Mirei was busy, I kept her company in the dining/living area, sorting out many boxes, amalgamating them into specific boxes... storage, the children's toys/games/craft items that they use every day, a box of wrapping materials, and a box for storage. That made a big difference as we are now down to just four boxes in the room for now, hidden somewhat behind the table, and have two surfaces clear in the rooms too, so that the Easter bunny will have an easier time hiding things tomorrow. </p>
<p>Akane made a lovely lunch for us all, and Mirei showed off her chopstick skills for us again. Akane's sister, Ayako, was arriving for a two short day/one night visit with us, and the children were so happy when she arrived! And she came bearing two sweet baskets for Easter, filled with candy treats. They are just perfect for our Easter setting. </p>
<p>Bryn and I walked to a row of shops about ten minutes away tops, to pick up some butter, and ran into the owners of the restaurant we went to last night. Their little boy, four years old, was very open and sweet, shaking hands with us, and speaking very politely to us. He has a very cute baby sister too, and later on we spotted the wife again, across the street from us, and greeted each other again. </p>
<p>Outside the grocery store, Bryn spotted a takoyaki stand. There were lots of these scattered here and there (think chip wagons in Ontario) but the first I had seen here. Takoyaki are battered octopus, the size of a golf ball, and they make them fresh while their customers wait for them to be rolled in the molds, deftly using chopsticks, and once there is sauce poured over them, they are boxed up. Akane, Ayako, and Bryn had a nice snack of them. </p>
<p>Ayako drove here from Sakai,  so off she went with Akane to buy metal shelving for the kitchen. This will be a huge help in organizing that room too, so slowly but surely the house is becoming home. It feels like it already to all of them. They picked up lots of groceries too, bulky items more difficult to carry home or in the bicycle basket. Having a car sure is handy, but it's amazing how well they manage without one here. There are lots of little shops, as well as bigger grocery stores within walking distance of the house, and some more available just a short bus or bike ride away. </p>
<p>The children and I went off to the playground for an hour plus; there were the usual crowd of children playing in both the upper and lower areas, although it was really hot there today, and no shade at all anywhere. Thank goodness there is a water tap, so the children can drink up when they are hot. </p>
<p>The rest of the day flew by! We coloured Easter eggs together before dinner and it was as much fun as always. Ayako had never done so before, and took her time decorating just one egg. The children enjoy it so much, and took their dipping seriously, and doing such a great job with their eggs. Riku worked fast and so he did my egg too, while I kept busy taking photos. We were very proud of our lovely eggs! </p>
<p>We suggested that Akane and Ayako go out for dinner and have the evening on their own, so I tubbed the children, Bryn figured out how to heat up the store-bought pizza despite the Japanese written directions, and cooked lots of veggies for the children as well. We were astounded at how much they ate... three pieces plus lots of veggies for Mirei, and four slices for Riku. Now they are not the big American slices but it still seemed a lot on their plates. </p>
<p>Bryn tucked in Mirei, I tucked Riku in, and then we both had lots of time on the computer, going to bed before the "girls" arrived home. </p>
