								<h2>Rainy Tuesday</h2>
								<p>Riku woke woke at 5:30 this morning, bright and lively and obviously ready for his day! I, however, was none of those and rolled over for a little more sleep. Riku lay so quietly beside me,  just relaxing and no doubt busy thinking important thoughts.  :)  I don't think there are too many children that age who would be okay staying quiet for a full half hour, but I am grateful that he doesn't mind. <br />
 <br />
At six he asked me if I was awake, and I stayed in that semi-stupor for another fifteen minutes, before reading to him and listening to his dream. We could hear rain falling, my first since arriving. It's a relaxing sound for sure, and I could easily have drifted back to sleep.<br />
 <br />
Riku walked to school carrying his school-mandated bright lime green umbrella, although I didn't know that at the time, and so was amazed to see about 75% of the same colour in the umbrella stand outside his classroom. And what fun to see all those bright colours moving across the bridge at our meeting point at 1:30. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it turned out that Riku had someone else's, with no name sticker on it, so I can see why so many of the other children in the other classes are carrying varying colours! Grade one is the first year of school here, so I guess by grade two the mothers have figured out it makes sense to not have the same colours as everyone else! </p>
<p>On the way to school today, Riku asked me how one gets a "black heart". We talked about that referring to mean people, that their hearts really look like everyone else's, but it's a way of describing someone who is evil, or unkind, or just plain bad. I told him that Scrooge had a black heart, and ended up telling him the story of "The Christmas Carol". We had been walking quickly for practice, trying to keep ahead of the people behind us at the bridge, and the story ended on the long pathway beside the garden very close to the school. I wish there was some way to capture the smile on Riku's face as he envisioned Scrooge knocking on Bob Cratchet's door on Christmas morning, carrying gifts and food for all! </p>
<p>How I love our walks to school together, and it is one of the things I was already missing in San Franciso, and will miss the most about our time here together. He mentioned the story again later that afternoon, and I'm sure it's the kind of thing he thinks about when he's quiet and on his own. </p>
<p>Riku had a couple of complaints today ... the teacher told him he had to walk faster (I must say the other children do walk at a much speedier pace than our meanderer!), and one boy in his class called him a name. Riku has decided he doesn't like him. We talked again about ignoring people who say mean things and he told me that is what he is going to do from now on. It's a hard lesson to learn, when feelings are hurt.</p>
<p>He enjoyed his school lunch and ate it all, he reported; how wonderful that Akane doesn't have to figure out what to give him to eat, as all too often he just didn't bother much with it. I think he always felt rushed and so didn't put much effort into eating. However, he seems to like these hot lunches, and today it was fish, vegetables, and rice, with milk to drink. It seems that perhaps they get dessert only on Fridays, as he did say he had some kind of apple dessert last week. None since then though, but he eats lots of fruit at home, and would absolutely eat that first if they served it to him with his lunch! </p>
<p>And then on to the newly independent boy telling me that tomorrow he wants me <strong>not</strong> to meet him at the usual spot for pick up! We agreed that I would be somewhere on the next street after he turns right. It would be wonderful if he felt confident enough to do this on his own before I leave in four plus weeks. That's our goal. </p>
<p>Once home, I showed Riku a fun video of a crowd of people dancing in the train station in Antwerp to the tune of one of his favourite songs ... "Do, a deer, a female deer ...". He was still humming it a few hours later. </p>
<p>The one and a half hours before Bryn and I left to meet Mirei passed quickly. Riku played upstairs with his Lego for the longest time, and Bryn joined him for a bit too. I went upstairs when he asked for help in picking up the Lego, and told him how his dad, when he was Riku's age, didn't like picking up his Lego pieces on his own either. I told him we solved the problem by putting all his Lego on a big sheet, and when it was clean-up time he just had to gather all the corners together and put it in the big brown plastic bucket that we still have in SF. He likes hearing these stories, and often wants me to repeat them to him until he can tell them himself. He's a "family" boy for sure!</p>
<p>After that, Riku read a few pages of his choice of an English book to Bryn; it's on his "to do" list for every day. Riku is a good reader and likes to read, but likes it much better if it doesn't happen after dinner, when he is tired. He so looks forward to a story being read to him at bedtime. </p>
<p>Mirei came down the steps at school today looking a little glum (tired), but cheered up when we told her we were going for a snack. On the way to finding one (the little patisserie near the school is closed on Tuesdays), she nibbled at the little cheese crackers I had for her. Not far from the corner store, her teacher passed by on his bike, and turned back to say goodbye to her. Oh my, she was pleased! Some of the older children getting into cars with their parents also said goodbye to her in French, using her name. She always smiles but acts a little shy, and once we are past them tells me, "She is in my French school!" </p>
<p>Mirei is always hungry at pick-up. One day last week she told us they had donuts for a snack, but Akane talked to the teacher the next day or two, and was told it was all her                imagination, as they don't get any food between meals, as is the French tradition. This was news to me, but apparently snacks are never given, so that time between lunch at noon and being met at 4, is a long time for this girl who is used to one or two hearty snacks in that time period!. She wolfed down her round pizza bun in no time, both times Bryn and I picked her up. </p>
<p>Browsing in a corner store (there are  7â€“11s here too!) with Mirei is such fun! Walking there   she told me she wanted bread, but once inside headed right for the custard/pudding aisle, choosing one that appealed to me too ... coconut yogurt as it turned out, not a soft yogurt, but one made with coconut milk and slightly gelatinous (perhaps from the coconut). I bought that for her, and Bryn bought a tuna rice ball, which she didn't touch, and some fries which she nibbled on. Really she just wanted to get home and get to that coconut treat! </p>
<p>The bus was hot and crowded but a very kind woman gave us her seat, and Bryn got the seat beside us; we were so lucky as it was packed like sardines in there. Mirei held onto that container all the way home! The closer we got to home the harder it was for her to keep her eyes open, though; we don't think she napped at school today, and how we wish we could be flies on the wall and see what she did instead. Bryn carried her home from the bus spot, and as they went along she lost first one boot, and then the other! She thought that was pretty funny, and of course knew I would pick them up. At the corner Bryn took off one of her socks, and then the other, and had her giggling away by the time they got home. He knows how to keep his girl happy! </p>
<p>Riku was happy to see her, and off they went to play upstairs. Akane was making a light dinner of rice and veggies for us, with chicken added to theirs, so when it was close to dinner time, I popped Riku in the tub. Mirei decided that she would not have a bath tonight, a first for her since I arrived, and so Riku had the tub to himself.</p>
<p>Bryn then had some quiet time with Mirei, and she read all the letters in English out to her dad on the covers and sometimes the backs of various books. She is good at this and getting better, as she has a great memory for such details. More and more often she is recognizing lower case letters and points out the upper case letters to Bryn, telling him, "That is the same as this." It's fun for her, and she likes the idea that she too has to do homework. Riku is happy there is none for him yet! </p>
<p>Mirei is practicing her counting in French. It's pretty darned cute hearing her say the numbers herself, listen to her Daddy, repeat them, and then come in to tell me how to say it. And she often tells us that "This is Japanese" or "This is English", just to make sure we are keeping track too. </p>
<p>The children were finished dinner by 6:15, Riku did some written spelling homework with Bryn, and then had more play time again before tuck-in at 7 P.M. Oh, that coconut "yogurt" ... I had a bite and liked it, as did Bryn, and between Mirei ("I will share with you Riku") and Riku they polished off the good-sized container for snack and dessert. </p>
<p>Riku told me he was going to sleep upstairs tonight, so Bryn read to him and tucked him in , and Akane took MIrei up not long after to join them. All four fell asleep together and I had the downstairs to myself from 7:30 until I went to bed at 11. I wrote lots of emails, and it was great to catch up. Patrizia had written from Italy, and it was so nice hearing from her. (she is one of my doula moms, and one day I hope to visit her and her family at their new home.</p>
<p>Today was the first day we didn't get to the playground ...</p>
