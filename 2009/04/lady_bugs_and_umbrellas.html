								<h2>Lady Bugs and Umbrellas</h2>
								<p>It was raining lightly when walking Riku to school today, and that meant there were lots of ladybugs sitting on leaves along the main road leading to his school. We had left the house early enough to loiter a bit so that we could count the ladybugs. There were so many of them, and we didn't stop, but still got up to 34 ladybugs and two spiders! Riku was so excited and told me to remember so we could count some on the way home. </p>
<p>At 1:15, just as I was eating a delicious treat Akane had picked up for my lunch — kabocha and potato croquette and five thick slices of fried sweet potato with sticky syrup baked on them —  Bryn called to ask me to meet him and Akane at the bus stop. They had gone out together to take care of immigration papers for Bryn, and I did lots of emailing in their absence. </p>
<p>We were on our way to sit in on Riku's classroom for forty-five minutes, and it was a fun experience. The teacher is appealing in that she is very expressive, has fun with the lessons, the class is under control, even with thirty students, and she has a good sense of humour too. She's active when she's teaching, moving around quite a bit, when leading the children in questions and answers, and when checking their printing. Riku had his hand up several times, which was nice to see, and I took two shortish videos of the class in action. </p>
<p>Today was the first day the children went to school until 2:30. This is the third and final transition for them, which I so liked to see happen with these first-time-to-school children, and so very handy for Riku too to adjust. </p>
<p>On the way out of school, I spotted a trio of young girls all holding their bright lime green umbrellas. I asked if they could take their photo and they all too happily posed for me. Sweet sweet! </p>
<p>Bryn and I walked Riku home, completely forgetting about the ladybugs, as there was lots of chatting instead. He had about ten minutes for a quick snack, and was out the door with Bryn to meet Akane at the bus stop. Tonight is Riku's Chinese class, set up from last weekend's evaluation. He is in a class with a boy his age, with two Japanese parents. They had lived in China for three years where the child attended nursery school, so they want him to keep up his Chinese as well. Bryn says he is a very chatty little boy, and friendly, so this sounds good for now. It takes over two hours though to get there and back with the forty-five minute lesson, so ideally Bryn would like to hire someone to come to the house instead. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, I took my third trip in a row on my own to meet Miss Mirei at her school. I had picked up a second pizza round for her treat today on the bus, and took along some apple slices too. We have a nice little routine going here! What is the most fun is seeing her interact with the women on the bus. Today we lucked out once again, as the bus was crowded, but we found one seat right at the very back, a bench seat, and Mirei sat on my lap eating her pizza, and not missing a thing that was going on around her. </p>
<p>The woman beside me had hung her umbrella on the hand grip in front of her seat. Mirei thought that was a great idea, and insisted on hanging her own up beside the other. A few stops later another woman sat beside us; Mirei suggested to her that she too hang up <strong>her</strong> umbrella; all three of them were quite delighted with the swaying umbrellas. </p>
<p>The very sweet woman who had sat beside us on Friday was on the bus again today, and they were delighted to see each other. Mirei pointed her out to me first, but then the woman spotted Mirei and gave her a big smile. There was never an opportunity to sit beside her this trip, but we no doubt will see her again. Mirei gave out her big "bye bye!" when she left.</p>
<p>Originally the plan for dinner was to meet up somewhere after Riku's lesson, but Mirei is such a tired girl after school, and often has to be encouraged to keep those big brown eyes open! I had decided to suggest we just head home, and not try to find something to do for an hour with her. Bryn thought the same thing and called to cancel.</p>
<p>So Mirei and I had the evening to ourselves. I made pasta for our dinner with lots of carrots and cucumbers to go with it. She had dessert, a mango ice cream treat, we did a puzzle, and then it was tub time. All was well until it was time to get out and then Mirei just gave in to her long busy day and cried so hard. Then she cried again, telling me she didn't want to wear diapers with her PJs ("Diapers aren't cool, right Nana?"). She was so tired, and I hadn't expected Bryn and crew to be out so late. They walked in at 7:35 and Mirei cried once more, not wanting to stop playing with the little tiny refrigerator with tiny tiny food and dishes. It is adorable and I wouldn't have wanted to stop either! However, soon all was quiet, Riku was in his PJs and prepped for bed immediately, and was asleep by 8:10 after I read "The Boy Who Drew Cats", a lovely whimsical and yet still quite dark story by a Japanese author.</p>
<p>Akane was down not too much later but had a few things to do before settling in at her computer, so I managed to get lots of emailing done, and worked on my blog as well. Bedtime at 10:15 for me!</p>
