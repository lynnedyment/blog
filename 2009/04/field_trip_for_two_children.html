								<h2>Field Trip for Two Children Today ... and Riku Lost Another Tooth!</h2>
								<p>Ah, I am happy to say that Riku slept until 6:20 this morning, and I slept right along with him, waking with his warm hand tucked in behind my neck. Waking couldn't be sweeter than this. </p>
<p>Mirei was up and in great spirits, ready for her first field trip. However, she had lots of time before leaving, so proceeded to take the little basket of tea towels and dish cloths from the kitchen shelf, take everything out, and carefully refold it all to her liking. She and Riku also had enough time to look at a site for French that Bryn pulled up for them, and soon they were both repeating numbers in French from one to twenty and singing "Frère Jacques" with gusto! </p>
<p>Both children took big lunches to school, and Riku's was packed in his light nylon knapsack from SF. No books today! Mirei went to the local (and famous) palace, a place I haven't been to yet, and Riku went to the Botanical Garden. We saw all the buses lined up as we walked to school this morning. By mid-morning, the sun was out and the day was warming up, so a perfect day for this. Tomorrow calls for rain. </p>
<p>Bryn was working on his computer when Akane called; Riku and a boy at school were fooling around and the boy accidentally hit Riku's mouth and his sideways-facing, so- close-to-coming-out tooth had been knocked and was bleeding. His teacher took him to the dentist, who pulled the tooth, to make more room for the two teeth trying hard to come in behind it. The teacher then took Riku on the bus to join the others.</p>
<p>Akane was out for most of the day, so there was lots of time for me to work through a backlog of emails, plus bring in and hang up another load of laundry outside. Rain expected tomorrow. </p>
<p>Riku came roaring in the door today, full of energy and the "rest of the story". Seems the tooth incident was not an accident at all. A boy in Riku's class told Riku he wanted to play with him, and when Riku said he didn't want to, the boy hit him in the mouth. His tooth bled, and Riku told the teacher, who gave the boy two "talking -to"s, Riku explained. He said he cried a little bit but not too much, and again at the dentist a bit, but not too much. He was tired from a full day out walking, so settled in with a book and some fruit to cool off. His teacher came by to tell Bryn that Riku was no doubt tired, and apologized about what had happened. Riku watched a bit of a movie, but soon was bored, and went over to invite Yuu-kun over to play for a half hour. </p>
<p>Mirei came bouncing in with her mom at 5 o'clock full of vim and vigour. She did lots of walking today, and was so tired at one point that she got a shoulder ride from her teacher and fell asleep too at some point during the day. She has not been napping as she was when she first started, but tells me she just plays with toys instead. I think she does get some quiet time too, which is just fine, as she is more than ready for bed at 7 o'clock these days. </p>
<p>We had our usual evening, with stories, spelling, tubs and dinner, a quick dinner tonight of store-bought pizza, which everyone likes, as well as cucumber and lots of cooked carrots. I had a big bowl of soup I had made yesterday as I had a big lunch today... a combination of a noodle-veggie dish Akane had made last night,  along with three tiny side dishes from a "mixed plate" Akane bought for me today. </p>
<p>Riku and I had just finished reading, turned out the light and he was settling down, when he remembered he had to put his tooth under his pillow! It's there now, waiting for the tooth fairy to come along in the night. </p>
<p>Oh, Riku looks awfully cute with those two nubby little new teeth coming through. Mirei had lots to say about teeth and how when she is big she will lose her teeth too. Oh yes, she will. I just can't imagine her being a toothless six year old! </p>
<p>Tomorrow is the weekend!</p>
