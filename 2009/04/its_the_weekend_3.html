								<h2>It's The Weekend!.. well, Friday, so Close!</h2>
								<p>That's what Bryn told the children this morning; their last day of school for this week and lots to look forward to. </p>
<p>The children are very excited about Easter coming up, with only two more days to go! I brought Easter decals for the windows for them from SF, and two days ago we stuck bunnies and eggs and chicks up on the living room, dining room, and bedroom windows. They are so looking forward to colouring Easter eggs tomorrow;  Auntie Ayako will be joining them too, as she is coming to visit for the weekend. They will be able to give her some pointers, as she has not likely coloured eggs before. </p>
<p>We had our usual morning here getting ready for school. Riku and I both woke at 6 A.M. but I thought it was 7! So back under the covers we went, with time for another chapter in our book "The Phantom Toll Booth". </p>
<p>It was quite a leisurely morning with that extra half hour, so Riku had time to draw; Mirei drew and wrote some letters... M, X, and O, as well as Xs and Os for kisses and hugs for me. While saying goodbye to us at the door at 8 A.M. she told me she wasn't going to cry at school. She has said this, I believe, each day since starting, but today she meant it! We were so excited when Akane told us she had a tear-free beginning to her day! </p>
<p>I asked Riku to lead the way to school this morning, and even though he told me he didn't know which way to turn, each time I asked him, he always chose the right way. Eventually he will be walking to school either on his own, or with some neighbourhood children, so we want him to start being aware of where he is and where he is going. </p>
<p>After leaving Riku at his classroom,  I stopped to take some photos at the school... boys- double-Dutch skipping(!), girls lined up doing single skipping, the children playing baseball and soccer, the bright flowers in their bright pots, and the school itself from the main road. On my way out of the school grounds, a group of five boys walked up to me and one of them said "Hello!" This has happened occasionally since I arrived, with a child wanting to speak English to me, but it was interesting to have five boys in a group do so. They all took turns greeting me and then one boy told me his name, pointing to his chest. The others followed after I told them my name. One asked me where I was from, and I said "Canada" which elicited oohs and ahhs. It was a very sweet encounter and I hope to have many more of them. </p>
<p>The three hours at home passed quickly today, as I started sorting through the big boxes in the living/dining room to get some order established. Soon there were piles of clothing for each person established, then boxes for storage, children's games/books/toys, wrapping materials, etc. Four boxes later it all looked much organized, even while we wait for permanent homes for most of it. A nice lunch of egg and toast and tea, and it was time to pick Riku up. Today was the first pick-up at 1:30. I thought this was the regular day's end from now on, but this is a second transmission period and eventually he will be going until 2:15, a half-hour shorter day than in San Francisco. </p>
<p>They were later than usual crossing the bridge today, so I had some time to stroll along the river bank. As the group came closer I could see that Riku looked quite sad. He had one of those days that children inevitably have at school; a boy copied his work (which he didn't like at all), the girl who sits beside him and with whom he has to hold hands on their way to the bridge insisted on going too fast, which had them walking too closely behind the children in front (at least for his taste!), and he said an adult — not clear who it was — told him he couldn't cry when he bumped his head. So we talked about it all on the way home and then he talked about it with his dad, and that seemed to get it out of his system. </p>
<p>He had his first lunch at school today (pasta, bread, spinach, and an apple in some form ... perhaps applesauce) and he enjoyed it all very much. Nice for Akane not to have to make his lunch too! </p>
<p>Riku had a snack at home, and then we went off to the playground for a very short visit. Today he wanted to do some Chinese writing there! So off he went with his backpack packed full again, and chose a different bench to work on. He was quite pleased with his full page, and then had some time to practice his balancing walking up and down the teeter-totter. </p>
<p>Bryn had gone out for some time on his own, and we met at home to pick Mirei up from school again.She was a happy girl, happy to see us, and so proud of herself for not crying today. Bryn treated her to another round of pizza from the patisserie, and we were lucky enough to catch a bus immediately. Today Mirei chatted up an elderly man, who had a red feather in his hat. She called out "Hello!" (in Japanese) to him in a very loud voice, and then when Bryn reminded her to speak more quietly, called out to him using a few different phrases trying to catch his attention. He was trying hard to not pay any attention at all (I find men here in general most passive when it comes to interacting with anyone; I often feel invisible as they often refuse to meet my eyes, even when it would be so easy to acknowledge one another's presence). So, Mire, being her persistent self, refused to give up, and he finally gave a little wave to her as he walked by the window after exiting the bus. This is one determined little girl! </p>
<p>Riku had a follow-up visit to a dermatologist today, and the clinic hours were 6–9 P.M. He, Akane, and Bryn left before 6, hoping to get in early, and Mirei and I walked to the playground. It was hot, but she enjoyed some time on the slide and the teeter-totter, and she enjoys the walk there and back as well. At home she spent quite a bit of time being a "mommy", busy with her babies in both beds and strollers! and had a cool drink, waiting for everyone to arrive home. Today she wore a little Japanese jumper to school, and she just looked like a tiny Japanese grandma to me. </p>
<p>Today on his hour away, Bryn had met the owner of a restaurant/bar, and found him very friendly. The fellow was quite chatty, had been to SF and especially liked Chinatown, and has a young family as well, a boy and girl exactly two years younger than Mirei and Riku. So, Bryn suggested we all go for dinner there tonight. It was a little late by the time they arrived home — 7:30 — but we went anyway. The children are always either in bed by that time, or very close to being tucked in. </p>
<p>Service was quite slow, unfortunately, but the children were very well behaved as they always are in restaurants. Riku drew, of course, and Mirei chatted away to us, asking lots of questions about the nearby patrons. The food eventually arrived, all but my dish of vegetable fried rice. The children ate well and enjoyed it, and Mirei astounded us by using adult-sized chopsticks incredibly well! Unfortunately, I didn't have my camera with me, but she looked an old hand at it! </p>
<p>My dish showed up just as the smoking patrons were getting to me, so Mirei and I headed off in the dark for home. It was a lovely night, and we looked at the stars and for the moon. Bryn's beer was 500 yen ($5.00) tonight because it was a full moon, but we didn't get to see it. </p>
<p>I had Mirei all set for bed when the others arrived home with the take-out containers, and then I tucked Riku into bed. I wasn't too long out of bed myself, but did take a few minutes to eat a half cup of my dinner, and then a half hour to do a little Ancestry family tree work, answering an inquiry from someone on Doug's mom's maternal line. That was enough to relax me and head off to bed.</p>
