								<h2>Getting to Know the Neighbourhood</h2>
								<p>Riku and I had a lovely long sleep-in this morning, waking at 7:15 and reading a couple of stories while snuggling under the twin duvets. The house is cold in the mornings since the heater is only in the living room. Akane and Bryn just keep the living room/dining room/kitchen area closed off with doors, and once we are in there it's cozy. Getting out of bed is a challenge with this warm little body cuddled in beside me, though! I made porridge for the children and sat at the table with them while they ate. Riku was all set to walk out the door at 7:45 but poor Mirei was so upset about having to go to school. I left the house with her crying, not wanting to get her coat on, and it's so hard to hear. </p>
<p><em>(I'm just not good at that part of childhood. I wasn't when Brynnie was a little boy, and cried at nursery school, junior kindergarten, and even kindergarten, and it didn't get any easier with Riku at nursery school either. And the older I get the harder and harder it gets, I think, as now I just find it heartbreaking, not just horribly upsetting!  It doesn't even help knowing that a happy little girl gets picked up at the end of the day; I just want to let her stay home and play. I'm a softie, and it's not even in Mirei's best interests, I know. Which is why I just don't say a word, but get out of hearing! )</em></p>
<p>I walked Riku to school on my own today, and found our way down to the main road with no trouble at all. I took along my camera and snapped a few photos on the way back to the house ... a lovely private home, a little shrine, and a ramshackle building in the midst of mostly well kept up homes. This isn't unusual though, and I shall continue to snap photos of the various incongruities. </p>
<p>Once at home, I had breakfast, including my usual big comforting mug of hot chocolate, checked my email, and then started going through one of the many boxes piled in the living room. It wasn't long before the 11:30 pick-up for Riku, and Bryn and I walked over together to get him. It was a treat to see all those children, hand in hand, two by two, walking toward us over the bridge. Of course Riku was all smiles when he spotted us and skipped along home. </p>
<p>Riku and I sat together at the table while he ate a big lunch, I went up with him to his room to see all his Lego projects, and we played several games of a very unusual tic-tac-toe game, one in which we each get to be winners many times over. It's fun for both of us,but most especially Riku who. like his dad, doesn't much care for losing. Riku likes a little quiet time on his own, so once Akane left to pick up Mirei, I got a little more unpacking done, mostly tossing out packing material and/or tidying it up into one big box that had already been started. </p>
<p>Once Mirei got home and had a little snack, she, Riku, and I walked to the local playground, just a five or six minute walk up the road. There was a group of girls there playing on the slide, standing at the top, and down along to the bottom, being "tunnels" and they were more than happy to let Riku and Mirei join in too. </p>
<p>Home, tub, dinner, story-time with Riku, bedtime by 7:30, and at 10 o'clock bedtime for me too, still on San Francisco time! I've done well with this jet lag  though, by not sleeping during the day. It was a bit of a fight not falling asleep with Riku tonight though. Yawn! </p>
