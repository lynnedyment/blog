								<h2>A Very Quiet Saturday at Home</h2>
								<p>Bryn is working hard this weekend, with a big project on his mind, Akane has errands to run on her own, and so we had a nice quiet day just hanging about. This was fine with me and with the children too, as after breakfast and their "morning routine" — teeth, hair, face — they kept themselves busy and happy together upstairs in their room all morning. </p>
<p>Riku is constantly readjusting things in his part of the room. It's a long narrow bedroom, and he is at one end, and Mirei at the other. Riku has found places for everything that is out so far, and every time something new comes out of a box, he spends time finding the perfect place for that. He's meticulous, and knows when someone (aka Mirei) has moved something, although she pretty much knows by now that she is not allowed to do this without permission. </p>
<p>I went up to the "box" room and continued sorting. I pull out any clothes of the children's, any kitchen/household item, and continue sorting things into separate boxes for Akane, Bryn, CDs, books, and things to be dealt with down the line. The children would bounce in now and then to see if I had uncovered anything new and interesting, but for the most part they were busy with their own games. </p>
<p>One of the most popular ones right now is "cats". Usually Mirei is the cat and Riku the human, so she crawls around purring at him, and rubbing against his leg, while he pats her or puts a cushion down on the floor and tells her to nap. Mirei wants a milk dish too, and some cat toys to play with, and so it continues. When Riku gets annoyed with Mirei, his big threat is that he is not going to play cats with her ever again! </p>
<p>Riku certainly likes more quiet time on his own than his sister does. She likes to interact! It's hard for her to understand that Riku sometimes just does not want to play so she will bug him deliberately to get some kind of attention from him. It works, but not always in a positive way. Mirei and I had some story time together at one point, just to give Riku some "space". Mirei will happily sit and let me read every Caillou book in the house, and even when being read to, she is talking about the story, asking questions, pointing out things I might not have noticed, etc. One has to be a very different reader with Mirei than with Riku, who just wants to hear the story and then think about it. </p>
<p>After lunch the sun came out and it was time for some fresh air! Off we walked to the playground, and we spent an hour and a half there with no trouble at all. Mirei has inherited Riku's fondness for bugs, and will go off searching happily with him, calling if she spots a spider, or anything moving at all! They play so well together in this setting and it's a pleasure just sitting back and watching it all happen. They both enjoy drinking from the water tap there and Mirei has learned to balance carefully on the narrow edge so she can do it herself. </p>
<p>We got too hot eventually, came home, had cool snacks and drinks, and then the children went out to the front of the house to draw. I went back to unpacking boxes, and Riku decided that was a grand place to sit. </p>
<p>Akane came home and it was time for Riku to do his piano practicing, so Mirei and I went off for a walk on our own, just around a few blocks. She decided she needed to put on her "princess" dress that I brought for her from SF; she was always very fond of it, and so off we went. Mirei likes me to take her photo and poses for me very willingly. I have a sweet series of her being the dainty little girl in pink, but of course for every one of those photos Mirei likes to make a "funny face" and have me take that too. So, I am going to include that one of her, and one day all the others will be available in my "trip to Japan 2009" album! I keep thinking of how Mirei will just love seeing all these funny faces in the years to come. I hope this girl keeps smiling! </p>
<p>Once we were home, the nice young woman I met the other day, Noriko, came by to introduce herself to Akane. She has a son Riku's age, and three other children, I believe all younger. The four-year-old, she told Akane, was home on his/her own! Apparently this is not illegal or unusual, but it's not something that is going to happen in this family. </p>
<p>Usual evening routine ... a lovely dinner prepared by Akane, bath together for the children, some reading with them both, and then tuck-in time. I had a little time in the evening for emails, but spent most of it going through magazines I brought from home. </p>
<p>A lovely quiet day, and I think we will be heading out tomorrow for a trip somewhere new. </p>
