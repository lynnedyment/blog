								<h2>Another Busy Day ... and a Big One for Riku!</h2>
								<p>My day ... Riku literally up with the birds again this morning, smiling over me at 5:45! I didn't have the heart to put him off for too long though, and so we chatted and snuggled until it was time for me to shower. We were out the door at 8:05, perfect timing, as I am trying to get Riku to walk just a little faster, but not at a breakneck speed either. This got us to school today at 8:20, and we bid adieu at the back door of his classroom. I now have a little collection of students who regularly speak to me in English, and I look forward to this, both at school and the playground too. </p>
<p>Bryn told me when I got home that Mirei, both yesterday and today, not long after we left,  was ready at their front door, waiting for Akane to take her to school. Bryn gets quite a chuckle out of seeing this: Mirei standing patiently, with her "packpack" in place, admiring herself in the mirror in the hallway ... it makes me smile to think of it. </p>
<p>Riku had reminded me that today I would meet him around the corner at afternoon pickup, so I was about two blocks away when the little group of four students, and one adult "escort", turned into the street. My guess is that if no adult is waiting after the crosslight, then they are accompanied until there is an adult present. This won't go on for very long probably, but it's nice to know it happens. The fellow who was with them bowed when he spotted me.  I bowed back to him and said "arigatou gozaimasu", (the "u" after the first word extends the "o" sound, and at the end of the second word is silent), one of the few Japanese phrases I know. I wish my memory for new language were better, but I have far better luck remembering the French words I learned in grade nine! Riku was at the <strong>front</strong> of the group today for the first time! </p>
<p>We stopped, at Riku's request, at that little playground where we met, for about twenty minutes. Until the 1:30 pickup began, we were always in a hurry to get home for lunch. Now he has lunch just before dismissal.</p>
<p>Riku's confidence continues to grow, and today he carefully explained to me exactly where to place my hands and feet, if I ever did want to climb to the top of the rusting metal structure here. He was a bit nervous about going right to the top the first time, and took an easy way over to get there, but after that he was roaring to go, over and over and over again, albeit still carefully. </p>
<p>Riku is a helper at school this week during lunch, and I heard about it for the first time today! He loves doing it; he and two or perhaps three other students put on long white aprons and white cotton facemasks and carry in the rice or bread or milk to the other students. Riku said he wished he were the boss of the kitchen, as he would like to do this all the time! How I wish I could get in there and take some photos! </p>
<p>After a snack at home, Riku asked if he could play with Yuu-kun, a boy from his class who lives just a few houses up the street. Bryn was preparing to take him over to ask if they could get together here, when Akane walked in with Mirei, home early on Wednesday. He was happy to have the Japanese speaker home! Akane said they would need to make an appointment before this could happen, so they went off to do that, and came home with Yuu-kun in tow! </p>
<p>Riku was just thrilled to bits. Not too much later Ayami-chan, a little girl also in grade one and a good friend of Yuu-kun's, came to join them. The house was busy with those four children (Mirei was home too, of course) running up and down the stairs, in and out of Riku's room, and back and forth into and out of the little back yard! Poor Mirei; she would just get her shoes on, and get down the steps, and in they would come. The shoes had to come off, she needed help getting up the three concrete blocks into the house, and kept busy trying to keep up with them all! It was such fun for Riku, and I do hope that he and Yuu-kun become friends. Mirei is a big fan of Yuu-kun's, as well as a huge flirt!</p>
<p>Mirei and I went off to the playground while Riku did his piano practice, and spotted Yuu-kun and Ayami-chan on their bicycles. The children all seem to learn to ride bikes early here, and they are roaring up and down the road, winding their way around pedestrians and not seeming to mind the cars honking at them. It's a little scary to think that the next time I am here, Riku will no doubt be riding along with them! There are no sidewalks in this area, and the roads are narrow. Oh, and they don't wear helmets either!</p>
<p>Mirei was happy to be outside, and had insisted she change into her "exercise clothes" before we left the house. The sun came out mid-afternoon, and she was warm enough in shorts and a little t-shirt, but she moves constantly too, so would be taking off any extra layers anyway. Today a girl loaned her a yellow ball, and we practiced catching and throwing, moved on to kicking it, and "raced" from the slide to the teeter-totters a few times too, before heading home for a warm tub. </p>
<p>Riku and Bryn went off to the playground while Mirei was occupied, and then Riku was in the tub for some quiet time on his own. We had dinner ... tofu and rice for me, curry with vegetables and beef for them, and I had to battle Mirei not to eat my tofu! I cut up a carrot for myself after dinner, and Mirei decided my raw carrot was preferable to her cooked ones. That child likes whatever is on my plate much more than what is on hers! </p>
<p>Reading time for both children tonight as usual. Mirei does love to sit beside her daddy and call out those letters. She's a fast learner for sure. Tonight she entertained us by almost counting to ten in French ... "huit" is hard for her to remember right now, but by Friday no doubt she will have it down pat! </p>
<p>Yesterday she asked Bryn why she was going to French school. Bryn told her that one day she would be able to speak French, to which Mirei replied (in English) "but I am Japanese!" Not long after that, Bryn wanted her to tell that to her mommy, so asked her to tell her mommy whether she was French or Japanese. The answer, of course, was "I'm French."! That's our girl; entertaining, and always mischievous.</p>
