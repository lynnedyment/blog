								<h2>Travelling to Kyoto... and Arriving!</h2>
								<p>Leaving San Francisco ...</p>
<p><a href="/i/sfo.jpg"><img height="200" src="/i/sfo-thumb.jpg" width="266"></a></p>
<p>My flight to Kyoto was at 11:30 A.M.,  a perfectly reasonable time, as I do loathe getting up at 5 in the morning to start a trip!  Doug packed up my final bag this morning and I arrived at the airport with two bags to check, both weighing just under the 50 pound allowance. Anything that was overweight I was going to carry on the plane with me, but instead I was able to add some magazines to one of the bags. </p>
<p>Easy flight with lots of room. I had a window seat and sat with a friendly, chatty Japanese man on the aisle, and a seat between us. Over the course of the flight we talked several times; he drew up a small map showing me where Kobe, his hometown, is in relation to Kyoto and Osaka. He strongly urged me to do a day trip there, as it's beautiful and on the water. He kindly wrote up the names of a couple of restaurants in Kyoto where I can find vegetarian food, and told me to be sure to try the long white potatoes which are one of his favourite dishes. I slept perhaps an hour, watched one movie, and finished off a book. </p>
<p>I had two vegetarian meals on the plane, both small lunches. The first was a grain dish, possibly bulgar, with peas, corn, and green onion, served alongside stewed fruit, apples, pineapple, and peaches. It was hot and delicious. I had taken along a tuna sandwich, which I ate right after takeoff. I get hungry when I am on a trip, and was ready for my hot meal at almost 2 o'clock. We got snacks at the mid-point ... a tiny KitKat bar, a package of delicious oatmeal/pecan cookies, and some SunChips. </p>
<p>About an hour and a half before landing we got a second lunch. At first they thought they didn't have a meal for me, but that would have been fine as there was a vegetable selection along with chicken or beef, and it looked delicious, with noodles and veggies. But they found mine after all, and it was another grain, a mound of perhaps cornmeal, and the same hot fruit served along with it. It was filling and tasty, and I filled it out with carrot sticks, grapes, and apples. I had eaten the tiny mandarins earlier. I would have been hungry without my extras for sure! </p>
<p>Our flight arrived a half hour early, at 11:10 P.M. my time. It took a long time to get through immigration, as there were several planes in at once. There was a large sign reading "For Preventive Measures Against Acts of Terrorism. You Will Be Required To Be Fingerprinted and Photographed. (Facial Photograph)."  This process slowed things down quite a bit, but I am now in the system. The luggage was slow coming down too, and by the time I had it all on a cart and was out in the main area, Bryn was right there to meet me.</p>
