								<h2>¥500! and a Cold Rainy Day in Kyoto</h2>
								<p>So, the first thing Riku did this morning on waking was to lift up his pillow to check for that tooth fairy money and it wasn't there! He looked under both pillows, and under part of his duvet, and then said "Maybe the tooth fairy doesn't come to Japan" looking quite stricken at the thought. I assured him that she did, and told him I would be back in a minute. I checked with Bryn, who was in the dining room working, and he hadn't forgotten, it was there somewhere. Phew! When I went back in, there was the shiny Y500 coin just under Riku's knee! He was so excited, and started talking about which Lego set he would buy with it. </p>
<p>It was just pouring rain when we woke, and "it's the weekend"! No fair. Back in San Francisco, Mirei had learned to count the days of the week, Monday to Friday on her fingers, saying, as she pointed to each finger "This is Monday, this is Tuesday, this is Wednesday, this is Thursday, this is Friday" ... and then holding up two fingers to say, "And this is the weekend!" So, considering how much we all look forward to it, I think we deserve sunshine!  </p>
<p>Riku is even more excited about weekends here than he was in California, as he went to a Japanese school there on Saturday mornings from 9-12. He had fun, once he got there, but the thought of going was never appealing to him. We heard a lot of "Oh man, school again?" and "It's not <strong>fair</strong>!" from him, so he is just loving having these two days to just hang about in the mornings. When we're together, that has always meant an extra chapter of his book, telling each other our dreams, or a new story, while keeping warm under the blankets. </p>
<p>Today I was the one silently moaning as yesterday Akane had Googled to see if there was anything to do in Kyoto with children, and there is ... lots of temples and shrines, but of course all requiring a dry day to wander about the grounds. </p>
<p>We did have a nice slow breakfast together, though, with the children playing at the table for a nice long time. No push to get out the door, so time for looking at books, drawing, and puzzles. I enjoyed a very long shower, with time to wash my hair, scrub my feet, cut my nails, and not having to dash through it all with a time slot in mind. </p>
<p>It seemed reasonable to get Riku's daily English reading done early, so he and his Dad went upstairs for some quiet time together, then Riku had a break before piano practice. </p>
<p>Riku has been asking for his Lego magazines for a while now, as they are still packed in a box and there are lots of boxes to look through!  I had told him I would try hard to find them today (with no luck), but did make a valiant effort at it. </p>
<p>He and Mirei had lots of fun playing in their room, which is like a giant playroom right now with no beds set up yet. They kept coming in to the fourth bedroom (aka "storage room" right now), across from their room and discovering "new" things that I was uncovering ... a doll, stuffed animals, and tiny purses and "jewelry" for Mirei, and wooden trucks and tools and empty boxes(!) for Riku. </p>
<p>And, just when I was wondering what we could do for the rest of the day, the phone rang. It was the mother of a child from Mirei's French nursery school, inviting Akane and the children over for lunch and a play date! The just-turned-four-year-old little girl, Kako, was a favourite playmate of Mirei's, and yesterday was her last day at the school. She is going to be going to a Japanese nursery school from now on, so this was just such good timing. </p>
<p>Kako conveniently has two older brothers, one five and one eight, I believe. It was great to have piano and reading done with for the day, as they got picked up at noon and arrived home at 5 P.M.! </p>
<p>When the mom came to pick them up, Bryn said her children were piled in the back of the van like Labrador puppies, but he went out and buckled in Riku and Mirei. It's interesting that I have seen very few locals cross against a light, even when there is no car in sight, and yet despite the seat belt laws no one seems to pay much attention to them. </p>
<p>I finished unpacking two big boxes, and had a nice set of boxes organized for each of the household member's belongings, when I stopped for lunch. I polished off a mixed plate of delicious little tidbits Akane had picked up for me, and it was so good with a big hot cup of tea (it was <strong>cold</strong>). The house was chilly all day.  I then spent three and a half solid hours catching up on a huge number of emails and writing up yesterday's blog. </p>
<p>Bryn and I went out for a walk at four o'clock to pick up butter and milk, and doubled back after checking out prices at the 7/11 store and the small grocery store nearby. Milk was cheaper at the former and butter available only at the latter. I had another hour on the computer, until Akane and the children arrived home. </p>
<p>Bryn had dinner ready when they walked in the door ...  delicious pasta with the usual array of cooked and fresh veggies. I am very much enjoying the meals that Akane and Bryn prepare, and I don't miss cooking one little bit. </p>
<p>They had all had a great time, and were excited and very tired from hours of interacting with other children for such a long period. Then it was bath time after dinner; each child had a personal slow-down time, although Mirei used hers figuring out new ways to tie her mommy's hair towel around her. While Riku bathed, Mirei did her "homework", calling out letters to Bryn, and then before long it was bed time for these two children, both asleep by 7:30, although Riku was breathing so heavily with his allergies I wondered how he was sleeping at all. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn left at 7:40 for a movie their first since moving here in mid-March. It was a Chinese movie, directed by John Loo, called 'Red Cliff  Part 2", based on a true story. It was in Chinese with Japanese sub-titles, and they both enjoyed it very much. Bryn especially so when he learned that he has misheard Akane and the tickets were not $24 each, but $12! They were home about 11:30 and so I had lots of extra time going through photos, answering emails, blogging, and reading for a bit in bed before turning at 11 P.M. </p>
