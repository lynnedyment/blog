								<p>Leaving San Francisco ...</p>
<p><a href="/i/sfo.jpg"><img height="200" src="/i/sfo-thumb.jpg" width="266"></a></p>
<p>My flight to Kyoto was at 11:30 A.M.,  a perfectly reasonable time, as I do loathe getting up at 5 in the morning to start a trip!  Doug packed up my final bag this morning and I arrived at the airport with two bags to check, both weighing just under the 50 pound allowance. Anything that was overweight I was going to carry on the plane with me, but instead I was able to add some magazines to one of the bags. </p>
<p>Easy flight with lots of room. I had a window seat and sat with a friendly, chatty Japanese man on the aisle, and a seat between us. Over the course of the flight we talked several times; he drew up a small map showing me where Kobe, his hometown, is in relation to Kyoto and Osaka. He strongly urged me to do a day trip there, as it's beautiful and on the water. He kindly wrote up the names of a couple of restaurants in Kyoto where I can find vegetarian food, and told me to be sure to try the long white potatoes which are one of his favourite dishes. I slept perhaps an hour, watched one movie, and finished off a book. </p>
<p>I had two vegetarian meals on the plane, both small lunches. The first was a grain dish, possibly bulgar, with peas, corn, and green onion, served alongside stewed fruit, apples, pineapple, and peaches. It was hot and delicious. I had taken along a tuna sandwich, which I ate right after takeoff. I get hungry when I am on a trip, and was ready for my hot meal at almost 2 o'clock. We got snacks at the mid-point ... a tiny KitKat bar, a package of delicious oatmeal/pecan cookies, and some SunChips. </p>
<p>About an hour and a half before landing we got a second lunch. At first they thought they didn't have a meal for me, but that would have been fine as there was a vegetable selection along with chicken or beef, and it looked delicious, with noodles and veggies. But they found mine after all, and it was another grain, a mound of perhaps cornmeal, and the same hot fruit served along with it. It was filling and tasty, and I filled it out with carrot sticks, grapes, and apples. I had eaten the tiny mandarins earlier. I would have been hungry without my extras for sure! </p>
<p>Our flight arrived a half hour early, at 11:10 P.M. my time. It took a long time to get through immigration, as there were several planes in at once. There was a large sign reading "For Preventive Measures Against Acts of Terrorism. You Will Be Required To Be Fingerprinted and Photographed. (Facial Photograph)."  This process slowed things down quite a bit, but I am now in the system. The luggage was slow coming down too, and by the time I had it all on a cart and was out in the main area, Bryn was right there to meet me.</p>
<p>Arriving in Japan ...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/on_to_594_nishigamo.html">On to 59-4 Nishigamo!</a></h2>
								<p>It was wonderful to see Bryn waiting for me when I finally got out the door into the main area! We had quite the struggle with the big square box (fully loaded), my big blue suitcase (equally stuffed), plus my own carry-on bag with most of my clothes in it, and a small knapsack. The box was not just heavy but extremely awkward to carry, but getting to the train itself was fairly easy ... an elevator down to the platform and a twenty-minute sit while we waited. </p>
<p>When each train comes in there is an announcement made that the train will be cleaned before boarding is allowed. It's more than just going through and picking up any trash, but the floors get cleaned, the window ledges dusted, and the seats automatically turn to face the opposite direction. </p>
<p>There were two very loud and fairly young American males sitting in front of us. They had been drinking on the plane, and were loud while waiting in the station, as well as on the train. One of them was particularly loud and using foul language, and the conductor spoke to them right at the beginning of the trip, asking them to keep their voices down. They did and we were glad of it. On most trains, in most countries I believe, one would just have to grin and bear this kind of behavior. </p>
<p>We took a more expensive but faster express train to Kyoto, with just three stops, and arrived in at the Kyoto station at 6:15 P.M. We realized that we would not be able to get on the bus with these large and cumbersome bags, so headed for the taxi queue, a long and arduous process. Too late I realized I should have taken along the portable wheels, as it would have made this whole process so easy! </p>
<p>Taxi cabs here have seat backs covered in quite "fussy" white lace-like coverings, not just on the passenger seats but on the driver's seat as well. They look like something a very old-world style grandma at home would have on her chesterfield set. It was good to sit back and take in the scenery along the way, as it was a good twenty minutes ride "home". We passed through the busy downtown area, with lots of shops, then through a more industrial-feeling section, and finally into the more suburban area with homes, and more trees, heading toward the mountainous hills Bryn had described so well. They are at the very most northern tip of Kyoto, and as we drove along a river, the banks were lined with blossoming cherry trees. I decided I would take a long walk one day, once Riku is in school for a full day. </p>
<p>There were a few twists and turns to reach the house, and there we were, just as Doug and I had seen it on the computer at home (Google maps). I could have picked it out myself. We came in with me expecting to have two children running to greet me, but instead they were in the bath with Akane, and so while we were waiting for them, Bryn gave me a tour of the house. It's a lovely house, with bright spacious rooms, especially the living room/dining area, my room, and the children's room. </p>
<p>For now there are still lots of boxes around, waiting not only to be emptied, but for places to put it all. There are no closets in the bedrooms, two of which are traditional tatami rooms where dressers aren't allowed to be placed. Once the room now housing most of the boxes is cleared, a large wall unit will be used for Akane's and Bryn's clothes. So I can see there is lots to be done and, with three of us, it should all come together eventually. </p>
<p>It seemed a long time before those children came bursting out of the bathroom in their PJs! They climbed up on the sofa with me, both chatting at top speed, and each of them trying so hard to get my attention. Riku was showing me a new book, and wanting me to find hidden shapes with him, while Mirei was determined that I would talk only to her. It was so good to see those faces again! Riku looks so different with his missing tooth, and now there is a second one, close to coming out, but sticking out from his mouth on a funny angle. It looks hilarious! </p>
<p>He was most anxious to show me some "special presents!" he had for me, and Mirei wanting to show me their bedrooms, so up we went, with Mirei telling me to "be verrrry careful on the steps Nana; they are verrrry dangerous!" They have one long room on one side of the house which they will share eventually. Except for beds, it already looks settled, as Mirei has her stuffed animals, her tiny kitchen, a wee bench and her dolls on her side of the room. Riku has a bookcase with books and a neat array of small toys, plus a bench, Lego parts, and his dresser dividing the room at the moment. </p>
<p>On his window ledge was a small cup with neatly rolled pieces of paper in it, all for me. He had drawn some pictures and of course had his usual love note for me, with "Riku loves Nana" neatly written. He promised to draw me lots of pictures when I am here too, </p>
<p>I tucked Riku in fairly quickly, as both children were very tired from a late night the night before. Riku drifted off very fast, as he usually does, and was happy to have our familiar routine still holding ... a snuggle, a kiss goodnight, and then he rolls onto his left side, holding on to my hand. </p>
<p>Mirei, on the other hand, was not nearly so co-operative. It was harder for her to settle down, as she naps at her French nursery school, making it tough for her to go to bed as early as would be ideal. Instead of sleeping, she was lying beside me stroking Riku's hair and lacing her fingers through his; he was sound asleep, but I came downstairs and let Akane take over, hoping that would make it easier for this little girl to sleep. </p>
<p>By this time, it was close to 8:30, so I decided to settle in, unpack, and get organized, wanting to stay awake until a more reasonable bedtime for an adult. There is a very large shelving area in a cupboard in my room, but no hanging space (which is true throughout the house), but there was plenty of room to get my bag unpacked and tucked away on the base of that cupboard. I also pulled out the cream cheese, cheddar cheese, veggie "bacon", Acme sourdough bread, and the bagels, leaving the rest of the box and the blue bag for tomorrow. I made up the single futon, put the new cover on the duvet, and was tucked into bed at 11 P.M., twenty-six hours after waking in San Francisco yesterday. Off to bed. Yawn!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/first_full_day_in_kyoto_1.html">First Full Day in Kyoto</a></h2>
								<p>The sun was shining through the rice-paper shaded windows when I woke at 6:15 today. I slept very, very well, and was awake when Riku burst into the room at 6:30. He snuggled right in with me, warming up his cold feet on my warm legs. Now I know how Doug feels! Today is the first school day for Riku, although he was there with his parents and Mrs. Goda yesterday for a first-day ceremony, and did go to his classroom and sit at his new desk. </p>
<p>It was a busy morning, as both children had to get ready for school, and Mirei and Akane were going to accompany us to Riku's school just in case there were instructions for Riku that Akane needed to know. It was very cold in the house, so the warm sun when we stepped outside was such a treat ... a perfect beginning to this day for Riku! </p>
<p>Mirei rode on Bryn's shoulders and I tried to pay attention to just how to get to Riku's school. It's a twenty minute walk at a normal pace, and I will describe the turns we make at some later date. The cherry trees I saw in the dusk on the way in last night were just lovely along the riverside, and many people smiled and bowed to us as we passed them by. We heard loud voices across the river, and Bryn explained to Riku that it sounded like grown men exercising before going into work.</p>
<p>The school is very large with several buildings in all. The many steps were lined with flowers in individual pots, which look as though the children last term may have planted. There is a huge outdoor area with a high fence along three sides, where a vigorous game of baseball was being played, and soccer at the other side. We walked around to Riku's area, where he stepped into a corridor and put on his new "indoor shoes", a lightweight basic tennis shoe.</p>
<p>He was very confident and walked right in, checking to see how the other children had hung their knapsacks on the side of their desks. There was no teacher in sight when we left him sitting in his seat, with his female seatmate. The children were all just sitting quietly at their desks when we left at 8:15. </p>
<p>Akane and Mirei left us halfway home to continue on to the bus for Mirei's school. Bryn and I came home; I made some breakfast, and then started in unpacking some clothes. I made neat stacks of them and now they are neatly lined up on the window sills in the children's rooms, while Bryn's and Akane's had to stay downstairs awaiting a dresser. </p>
<p>Bryn and I left to meet Riku at 11:15, as he has early dismissal for the next three days. The gate we had walked through this morning was closed, and so we headed off in a new direction and met Riku in a neat line of students, two by two, holding hands, with his teacher at the front of the line and a helper at the back. They were with us all the way to the main road, and we learned that they will do this for a couple of weeks until the children are more comfortable with finding their own way home. </p>
<p>Riku was full of stories on the way home: he liked his school, he liked the teacher, and the children are nice. So far, so good. </p>
<p>After lunch and some play time at home, Bryn and I headed off to a nearby playground, just four blocks from the house. Riku decided he would take his new school backpack with him, complete with the photo of Skylar from Starr King! His plan was to draw while we were there, something new and different for him. There was a serious baseball game going on when we arrived at the lower part of this big area, and a swing set, a sandbox, and a slide, on the upper area. </p>
<p>We sat on a bench near the sandbox, and he worked away completely engrossed in it. After a while some older boys from the sandbox came over to talk to us, trying out their English, and being so sweet with Riku. When they were ready to leave, I asked if I could take their photo, and they posed readily for me, making sure that Riku was included. I hope he sees them again, as he was quite pleased with their attention. </p>
<p>Bryn and Mirei joined us about 5 P.M. Mirei was her usual beaming self, telling me that she did cry at school, but was happy now! Bryn was running up and down the slide, so both children tried imitating him. Riku can get about halfway up but I bet it's not long before he makes it to the top. Bryn was balancing on the teeter totter, walking up and down, and encouraged Riku to do the same. He was nervous about it, but did it with more and more confidence each time. I know he likes knowing he can do these things, and just needs some assurance that he can. Mirei was wise enough to know she still needed a hand. Just wait 'til next year though! We all got a chuckle watching Bryn stand on one leg juggling on the teeter totter... that Bryn! The walk home was lovely, holding hands while noticing all the things on the way... a very tall grouping of bamboo, a private (we think) garden, complete with a tiny wooden house inside the iron railings, a tiny kitten decoration in a flower pot, etc. I took a photo of them all standing outside their new home. </p>
<p>Dinner was almost ready when we walked in and after eating I gave Mirei one of her tiny baby dolls, along with a cotton receiving blanket that was always on her pillow at nap time at our house. Riku played with the bulging green "Hulk" Doug found for him in Vermont, so they had some quiet time before their tub, Mirei's first in the house. They have all been showering, but of course it is easier for me to bath them. The tub is deep and stainless steel, and even though initially Mirei didn't want to bath, at the end of it she didn't want to get out! <br />
 <br />
Riku is going to start sleeping in my room tonight; there is lots of room for both of us on two futons.We read a "Henry and Mudge" book, new to us both, and found it hard not to drift off with him when I was tucking him in. </p>
<p>I did the usual email check, some blogging, Facebook time, and then bed at 10:30;  I'm getting lots of fresh air and exercise and sleeping like a baby.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/wednesday_april_8.html">Getting to Know the Neighbourhood</a></h2>
								<p>Riku and I had a lovely long sleep-in this morning, waking at 7:15 and reading a couple of stories while snuggling under the twin duvets. The house is cold in the mornings since the heater is only in the living room. Akane and Bryn just keep the living room/dining room/kitchen area closed off with doors, and once we are in there it's cozy. Getting out of bed is a challenge with this warm little body cuddled in beside me, though! I made porridge for the children and sat at the table with them while they ate. Riku was all set to walk out the door at 7:45 but poor Mirei was so upset about having to go to school. I left the house with her crying, not wanting to get her coat on, and it's so hard to hear. </p>
<p><em>(I'm just not good at that part of childhood. I wasn't when Brynnie was a little boy, and cried at nursery school, junior kindergarten, and even kindergarten, and it didn't get any easier with Riku at nursery school either. And the older I get the harder and harder it gets, I think, as now I just find it heartbreaking, not just horribly upsetting!  It doesn't even help knowing that a happy little girl gets picked up at the end of the day; I just want to let her stay home and play. I'm a softie, and it's not even in Mirei's best interests, I know. Which is why I just don't say a word, but get out of hearing! )</em></p>
<p>I walked Riku to school on my own today, and found our way down to the main road with no trouble at all. I took along my camera and snapped a few photos on the way back to the house ... a lovely private home, a little shrine, and a ramshackle building in the midst of mostly well kept up homes. This isn't unusual though, and I shall continue to snap photos of the various incongruities. </p>
<p>Once at home, I had breakfast, including my usual big comforting mug of hot chocolate, checked my email, and then started going through one of the many boxes piled in the living room. It wasn't long before the 11:30 pick-up for Riku, and Bryn and I walked over together to get him. It was a treat to see all those children, hand in hand, two by two, walking toward us over the bridge. Of course Riku was all smiles when he spotted us and skipped along home. </p>
<p>Riku and I sat together at the table while he ate a big lunch, I went up with him to his room to see all his Lego projects, and we played several games of a very unusual tic-tac-toe game, one in which we each get to be winners many times over. It's fun for both of us,but most especially Riku who. like his dad, doesn't much care for losing. Riku likes a little quiet time on his own, so once Akane left to pick up Mirei, I got a little more unpacking done, mostly tossing out packing material and/or tidying it up into one big box that had already been started. </p>
<p>Once Mirei got home and had a little snack, she, Riku, and I walked to the local playground, just a five or six minute walk up the road. There was a group of girls there playing on the slide, standing at the top, and down along to the bottom, being "tunnels" and they were more than happy to let Riku and Mirei join in too. </p>
<p>Home, tub, dinner, story-time with Riku, bedtime by 7:30, and at 10 o'clock bedtime for me too, still on San Francisco time! I've done well with this jet lag  though, by not sleeping during the day. It was a bit of a fight not falling asleep with Riku tonight though. Yawn! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/our_little_french_miss.html">Our Little French Miss!</a></h2>
								<p>My days are settling into a routine, with the mornings helping with the children as they prepare for their school day, and then my walk to school with Riku, my walk home, and some puttering about the house. Akane is off taking Mirei to school, and usually stays out for most of the day. Bryn is working, we have some breakfast, he washes the dishes and I dry them, and the morning slips by. </p>
<p>I took a photo of Riku and his classmates being walked to the crosswalk today. Riku spotted me and gave me a big smile. We hold hands and chat all the way home. He doesn't talk about school so much, but about what he wants to do or what he was thinking about. It's hard to get any information out of his about what he does with his time there! </p>
<p>We do pass some interesting houses on the way home, and over the course of my time here, I will include some of them in my blogs. Today we passed a shrine outside a house, and Riku quite liked the little apron-like cloth covering most of it. </p>
<p>Riku is always ready for lunch, even after eating his little cheese cracker snacks (brought from San Francisco) on the way home. Then he's ready for some quiet time in the house for a while. Today that didn't last long and he was most anxious to get to the playground. Bryn and Akane had gone out for a noodle lunch, so I did up the few dishes, made myself a small thermos of tea, and off we went. It's hot in the afternoon, and Riku had his new hat on to keep the sun off his face. Our usual bench was busy with moms and toddlers so we chose a bench at the side of the play area today, a good spot for Riku to watch the baseball players, rescue a couple of balls for them, and water the dry bushes with a bottle he found. He had some big drinks of water, went down the slide a few times, and picked me some wild flowers. </p>
<p>He had a piano lesson scheduled for 4:30 today, a try-out session to see if it would be a good fit between him and the teacher. So, Bryn and I left the house to pick Mirei up from her Ecole Francais today. It was my first time on the bus here, and the drive further south into Kyoto was interesting, with the usual mixes of ugly new buildings tucked behind tiny wooden structures, lots of overhead wiring, beautiful blossoming cherry trees in varying hues of pink/white, and a lot of Caucasian tourists here for those blooms. It's about a five minute walk to the bus stop, and we had to wait five minutes for the bus, but we arrived at the school at five minutes past four, despite our having left a bit late. </p>
<p>I had heard so much about Mirei's handsome male teacher, and he is indeed. Mirei came out onto the porch smiling her big smile and Bryn had some time to talk to him about their routine. It's a busy day with playtime, outdoor play, painting/drawing, and a one hour nap following lunch. They do waken the children at 2, but that hour makes it hard for Mirei to settle in as early as she should. Akane had told us she would be hungry when she got out, so we stopped in at "Petit Pâtisserie" for a snack for her. She chose a round "pizza" and amazed us both with how quickly she ate it at the bus stop! </p>
<p>Of course she gets much attention on the bus, as she is so vocal, very inquisitive, and not always the quietest little girl. Women especially respond to her though in a very positive way, smiling at her, and a few of them spoke to her as well. The bus was crowded, but a kind woman offered us her seat, which meant Mirei could see out the window and comment on ever so many things. There was a woman sitting next to us, who asked where we were from. I told her Mirei was born in Japan but had been living in SF until last month. She volunteered that her daughter lives in Washington, and that she had been there to see the cherry blossoms in that city last year. Another daughter is pregnant and living nearby and she is most anxious to be a grandmother. </p>
<p>Tonight while Mirei was sitting on my bed, playing with her dolls, I heard her counting in French to them ... un, deux, trois. </p>
<p>Riku's piano lesson went very well and he will be going for classes every Thursday right after school. He liked the teacher, and seemed happy about his class. </p>
<p>It was late by the time they got home, so Akane made udon noodles with veggies and fish cake for the children, I tubbed them both, and Riku was sound asleep at 7:45, after one chapter.  I woke at 8:10, having decided to just lie beside him for a minute, but awoke thinking it must be an hour later. I like these long lazy days! </p>
<p>Akane tucked in Mirei, and that was the last we saw of her for the night! We could hear Mirei chattering away just as she did for Bryn the night before, when he fell asleep with her! </p>
<p>Eventually, Bryn and I did the dishes, and after answering just a couple of emails, I decided to work on my family tree for a while. It was very relaxing and I happily turned in to read at 10:30.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/its_the_weekend_3.html">It's The Weekend!.. well, Friday, so Close!</a></h2>
								<p>That's what Bryn told the children this morning; their last day of school for this week and lots to look forward to. </p>
<p>The children are very excited about Easter coming up, with only two more days to go! I brought Easter decals for the windows for them from SF, and two days ago we stuck bunnies and eggs and chicks up on the living room, dining room, and bedroom windows. They are so looking forward to colouring Easter eggs tomorrow;  Auntie Ayako will be joining them too, as she is coming to visit for the weekend. They will be able to give her some pointers, as she has not likely coloured eggs before. </p>
<p>We had our usual morning here getting ready for school. Riku and I both woke at 6 A.M. but I thought it was 7! So back under the covers we went, with time for another chapter in our book "The Phantom Toll Booth". </p>
<p>It was quite a leisurely morning with that extra half hour, so Riku had time to draw; Mirei drew and wrote some letters... M, X, and O, as well as Xs and Os for kisses and hugs for me. While saying goodbye to us at the door at 8 A.M. she told me she wasn't going to cry at school. She has said this, I believe, each day since starting, but today she meant it! We were so excited when Akane told us she had a tear-free beginning to her day! </p>
<p>I asked Riku to lead the way to school this morning, and even though he told me he didn't know which way to turn, each time I asked him, he always chose the right way. Eventually he will be walking to school either on his own, or with some neighbourhood children, so we want him to start being aware of where he is and where he is going. </p>
<p>After leaving Riku at his classroom,  I stopped to take some photos at the school... boys- double-Dutch skipping(!), girls lined up doing single skipping, the children playing baseball and soccer, the bright flowers in their bright pots, and the school itself from the main road. On my way out of the school grounds, a group of five boys walked up to me and one of them said "Hello!" This has happened occasionally since I arrived, with a child wanting to speak English to me, but it was interesting to have five boys in a group do so. They all took turns greeting me and then one boy told me his name, pointing to his chest. The others followed after I told them my name. One asked me where I was from, and I said "Canada" which elicited oohs and ahhs. It was a very sweet encounter and I hope to have many more of them. </p>
<p>The three hours at home passed quickly today, as I started sorting through the big boxes in the living/dining room to get some order established. Soon there were piles of clothing for each person established, then boxes for storage, children's games/books/toys, wrapping materials, etc. Four boxes later it all looked much organized, even while we wait for permanent homes for most of it. A nice lunch of egg and toast and tea, and it was time to pick Riku up. Today was the first pick-up at 1:30. I thought this was the regular day's end from now on, but this is a second transmission period and eventually he will be going until 2:15, a half-hour shorter day than in San Francisco. </p>
<p>They were later than usual crossing the bridge today, so I had some time to stroll along the river bank. As the group came closer I could see that Riku looked quite sad. He had one of those days that children inevitably have at school; a boy copied his work (which he didn't like at all), the girl who sits beside him and with whom he has to hold hands on their way to the bridge insisted on going too fast, which had them walking too closely behind the children in front (at least for his taste!), and he said an adult — not clear who it was — told him he couldn't cry when he bumped his head. So we talked about it all on the way home and then he talked about it with his dad, and that seemed to get it out of his system. </p>
<p>He had his first lunch at school today (pasta, bread, spinach, and an apple in some form ... perhaps applesauce) and he enjoyed it all very much. Nice for Akane not to have to make his lunch too! </p>
<p>Riku had a snack at home, and then we went off to the playground for a very short visit. Today he wanted to do some Chinese writing there! So off he went with his backpack packed full again, and chose a different bench to work on. He was quite pleased with his full page, and then had some time to practice his balancing walking up and down the teeter-totter. </p>
<p>Bryn had gone out for some time on his own, and we met at home to pick Mirei up from school again.She was a happy girl, happy to see us, and so proud of herself for not crying today. Bryn treated her to another round of pizza from the patisserie, and we were lucky enough to catch a bus immediately. Today Mirei chatted up an elderly man, who had a red feather in his hat. She called out "Hello!" (in Japanese) to him in a very loud voice, and then when Bryn reminded her to speak more quietly, called out to him using a few different phrases trying to catch his attention. He was trying hard to not pay any attention at all (I find men here in general most passive when it comes to interacting with anyone; I often feel invisible as they often refuse to meet my eyes, even when it would be so easy to acknowledge one another's presence). So, Mire, being her persistent self, refused to give up, and he finally gave a little wave to her as he walked by the window after exiting the bus. This is one determined little girl! </p>
<p>Riku had a follow-up visit to a dermatologist today, and the clinic hours were 6–9 P.M. He, Akane, and Bryn left before 6, hoping to get in early, and Mirei and I walked to the playground. It was hot, but she enjoyed some time on the slide and the teeter-totter, and she enjoys the walk there and back as well. At home she spent quite a bit of time being a "mommy", busy with her babies in both beds and strollers! and had a cool drink, waiting for everyone to arrive home. Today she wore a little Japanese jumper to school, and she just looked like a tiny Japanese grandma to me. </p>
<p>Today on his hour away, Bryn had met the owner of a restaurant/bar, and found him very friendly. The fellow was quite chatty, had been to SF and especially liked Chinatown, and has a young family as well, a boy and girl exactly two years younger than Mirei and Riku. So, Bryn suggested we all go for dinner there tonight. It was a little late by the time they arrived home — 7:30 — but we went anyway. The children are always either in bed by that time, or very close to being tucked in. </p>
<p>Service was quite slow, unfortunately, but the children were very well behaved as they always are in restaurants. Riku drew, of course, and Mirei chatted away to us, asking lots of questions about the nearby patrons. The food eventually arrived, all but my dish of vegetable fried rice. The children ate well and enjoyed it, and Mirei astounded us by using adult-sized chopsticks incredibly well! Unfortunately, I didn't have my camera with me, but she looked an old hand at it! </p>
<p>My dish showed up just as the smoking patrons were getting to me, so Mirei and I headed off in the dark for home. It was a lovely night, and we looked at the stars and for the moon. Bryn's beer was 500 yen ($5.00) tonight because it was a full moon, but we didn't get to see it. </p>
<p>I had Mirei all set for bed when the others arrived home with the take-out containers, and then I tucked Riku into bed. I wasn't too long out of bed myself, but did take a few minutes to eat a half cup of my dinner, and then a half hour to do a little Ancestry family tree work, answering an inquiry from someone on Doug's mom's maternal line. That was enough to relax me and head off to bed.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/saturday_april_11.html">At Home</a></h2>
								<p>Ah, Saturday! Riku got to spend his early morning in his very favourite way, snuggled up reading beside me. He is such a reader and if we aren't reading together he is going through his books on his own. Mirei joined us in bed too, and we had a lovely slow beginning to our day. After breakfast, Riku and Akane headed out for an Chinese evaluation class for Riku. He spent one and a half school years, plus summer school last year, working hard on that language. He's good at it, has a good ear, and enjoyed learning it, so it would be a shame for him to lose it at this stage. It seems there may be one boy in his class, as they seem to be at the same level. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mirei was keeping busy around the house, using her Daddy as a table at one point, doing a puzzle, and we read some books together. She loves to "do my homework" too, and draw and colour so our time passed quickly. I hung up some laundry, a "chore" that isn't a chore at all; I enjoy it all... hanging up the clothes in the tiny back yard, watching them blow in the light breeze, and bringing them in to fold, smelling that nothing-like-it long remembered smell. </p>
<p>While Mirei was busy, I kept her company in the dining/living area, sorting out many boxes, amalgamating them into specific boxes... storage, the children's toys/games/craft items that they use every day, a box of wrapping materials, and a box for storage. That made a big difference as we are now down to just four boxes in the room for now, hidden somewhat behind the table, and have two surfaces clear in the rooms too, so that the Easter bunny will have an easier time hiding things tomorrow. </p>
<p>Akane made a lovely lunch for us all, and Mirei showed off her chopstick skills for us again. Akane's sister, Ayako, was arriving for a two short day/one night visit with us, and the children were so happy when she arrived! And she came bearing two sweet baskets for Easter, filled with candy treats. They are just perfect for our Easter setting. </p>
<p>Bryn and I walked to a row of shops about ten minutes away tops, to pick up some butter, and ran into the owners of the restaurant we went to last night. Their little boy, four years old, was very open and sweet, shaking hands with us, and speaking very politely to us. He has a very cute baby sister too, and later on we spotted the wife again, across the street from us, and greeted each other again. </p>
<p>Outside the grocery store, Bryn spotted a takoyaki stand. There were lots of these scattered here and there (think chip wagons in Ontario) but the first I had seen here. Takoyaki are battered octopus, the size of a golf ball, and they make them fresh while their customers wait for them to be rolled in the molds, deftly using chopsticks, and once there is sauce poured over them, they are boxed up. Akane, Ayako, and Bryn had a nice snack of them. </p>
<p>Ayako drove here from Sakai,  so off she went with Akane to buy metal shelving for the kitchen. This will be a huge help in organizing that room too, so slowly but surely the house is becoming home. It feels like it already to all of them. They picked up lots of groceries too, bulky items more difficult to carry home or in the bicycle basket. Having a car sure is handy, but it's amazing how well they manage without one here. There are lots of little shops, as well as bigger grocery stores within walking distance of the house, and some more available just a short bus or bike ride away. </p>
<p>The children and I went off to the playground for an hour plus; there were the usual crowd of children playing in both the upper and lower areas, although it was really hot there today, and no shade at all anywhere. Thank goodness there is a water tap, so the children can drink up when they are hot. </p>
<p>The rest of the day flew by! We coloured Easter eggs together before dinner and it was as much fun as always. Ayako had never done so before, and took her time decorating just one egg. The children enjoy it so much, and took their dipping seriously, and doing such a great job with their eggs. Riku worked fast and so he did my egg too, while I kept busy taking photos. We were very proud of our lovely eggs! </p>
<p>We suggested that Akane and Ayako go out for dinner and have the evening on their own, so I tubbed the children, Bryn figured out how to heat up the store-bought pizza despite the Japanese written directions, and cooked lots of veggies for the children as well. We were astounded at how much they ate... three pieces plus lots of veggies for Mirei, and four slices for Riku. Now they are not the big American slices but it still seemed a lot on their plates. </p>
<p>Bryn tucked in Mirei, I tucked Riku in, and then we both had lots of time on the computer, going to bed before the "girls" arrived home. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/happy_easter_and_lots_of_conta.html">Happy Easter ... and Lots of Contact with the Locals, Too!</a></h2>
								<p>We had a fun Easter morning here, and I have lots of photos to show for it too! Riku was awake at 6 A.M. and thank goodness I was asleep at 10:30 last night, as I read him two chapters in his book; when Mirei joined us a half hour later, we read all four Easter books I had brought with me as well. </p>
<p>We weren't convinced that Ayako was going to make it out of bed to join us, but finally she did, and we adults gathered in the living/dining room area and watched two very excited children begin the hunt. There isn't a lot of furniture in this area, a sofa and a table and chairs, a keyboard, and a hutch, but somehow Bryn and I managed. The night before we put together  lots of little plastic eggs, filled with either pastel jelly beans or pastel M&Ms, plus lots of little plastic packages tied with cord, that Bryn filled, just as Doug and I did for our two, and Kelly did for her children. </p>
<p>After the last packet was found, we all sat at the table for  fruit, hard-boiled eggs, some tasty bakery treats that Ayako had brought with her, and tea & hot chocolate.</p>
<p>Not long later, Bryn and Riku went off to the playground to play Frisbee, and Mirei and I watered the front garden area. We filled several buckets with water, with Mirei "helping" me carry and pour it on the "very thirsty plants!", before we discovered a hose right in the front of the house! It was fun, and after they had lots of water, we walked over to the playground too. It was hot, and Bryn was ready to leave when we got there, but the children and I stayed on for another hour or so. Riku had discovered a little path among some bushes, and he and Mirei happily played "house" tucked away in there for a half hour or more; Mirei had her purse and bag of goodies hanging on a branch and there were lots of "Daddy", "Mommy" and "honey"s being banded about. </p>
<p>I was sitting on a swing above them, when an elderly woman came by, pushing a walker/chair. She sat nearby and started talking to me in Japanese. I told her I was from Canada, and once in a while when the children came to tell me something she fired off some questions to them too. Riku didn't always understand what she was saying but he was very polite and stayed until she ran out of steam. </p>
<p>Then along came a man, perhaps in his fifties, who was told immediately by the woman that I was from Canada. He instantly started talking to me in very easily understood English. His daughter used to live in Toronto, but now lives in Oregon and he and his wife visit her family — an American husband, and two teenage grandsons — each year. They fly to Vancouver and then drive down, and they very much like Vancouver as well. Turned out that he lives on the same road that we do, and when he left he said that perhaps we could visit one day. He knows I am here for another five weeks. </p>
<p>Before he left, however, three more women joined our little group. Two were older and it was obvious the middle gal had brought them out for a walk. Of course, the first woman announced I was from Canada, and so they got some information from the sole male there. It was very friendly and the women paid lots of attention to the children when they joined us. Mirei was very vocal of course and they were delighted that she could talk to them. There was lots of smiling, and bowing, and pats on heads for the little ones before we all said our goodbyes. Perhaps I will see them again! </p>
<p>Not too long after we got home, we heard music playing, and Bryn called for me to go to the door quickly with my camera. There was a very colourful parade in progress, and I will let a photo describe the scene as it varied in tone and concept. A beautiful large umbrella seemed to play a large role, and there were monks (if that is the correct term) in plain brown robes, and students in uniforms, and ordinary people walking along as well. It was quite lovely and a treat to see. </p>
<p>One woman who had been walking along with the group seemed to be holding back at our house. I thought she was merely being polite and letting me take photos unobstructed by her, but in fact she was waiting to talk to us. She is a local gal, born and raised in the main part of Kyoto, but now living here, just a few blocks away, in what she feels is the country now. Her name is Kiko, and she is married to a Dutchman named Peter, whom she met in the math department of a university in Houston, Texas, eight years ago! They are a charming couple, here just three months, and delighted to meet some "foreigners", as they put it, having seen just one or two in their time here. She is chatty and warm, and Peter and Bryn chatted easily as well. They liked Texas and enjoyed their time there. When we said goodbye, after Bryn and Peter exchanged contact information, Kiko went to shake my hand and then leaned over the fence and gave me a hug instead. I do hope we'lI see them again! Oh, Kiko also told me that the parade was a neighbourhood event, and she believed it was meant to give good luck to those under the umbrella.</p>
<p>After the children had lunch, Akane and Ayako went off in the car to buy groceries and a shelving unit for the kitchen. I tried unsuccessfully to put Mirei down for her nap. She is used to having one from 1–2 at school, and Bryn was hoping to keep her on track, but no such luck again today! Once it cooled down a little Bryn took the children to the playground again, and I had some computer time for blogging. </p>
<p>When I thought they would be on their way home, I ran the tub, and minutes later in they walked. They were all hot, and the tub was the perfect temperature, Riku assured me. While I tubbed the children, Bryn figured out how to bake the veggie pizza with Japanese instructions only(!), and cooked carrots and broccoli for the children's dinner. We had a great evening with them; they both ate a great dinner, Bryn and Riku read, and the children were in their PJs and ready for tuck-in when Akane and Ayako arrived home. Riku was sound asleep at 7:30 and Mirei not much later. </p>
<p>I ate the last of my fried rice with veggies from Friday night, and worked hard on a blog for some of the evening. I also did a very small bit of Ancestry as it's a treat for me just before bedtime. </p>
<p>Another week of school begins tomorrow for the children ... and a busy week for three adults too. </p>
<p>The darling drawing of the chick was done by Amelia and arrived for the family here for Easter. (I hope I have one waiting for me in SF! She had made a big one which was on their front door the week before Easter... love it!) </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/daitokuji_temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple and "Soccer" Time!</a></h2>
								<p>We had our usual busy morning getting the children ready for their day at school, although both children were awake earlier than usual, so had some time to play too. It is handy to have a village of three to get two children ready for their day!</p>
<p>Riku and I left at 8:10, though, five minutes later than I would have liked to, and it was a faster, more focused, walk to school as a result! However, we made it in lots of time and today more children were wandering about the room than usual. Perhaps those first few days they were more intimidated and felt they should sit at their desks.</p>
<p>On the way out of the school grounds, where the principal stands to greet us, and a few boys behind a fence above, called out big "Hello!"s to me, grinning away when I replied. I find it interesting that boys from about 10-13 are much more likely to approach me, with the specific purpose of speaking English. Girls are less likely to do so, and even if they look interested are more shy about actually saying more than "hello". Almost always the girls will break out in giggles once they have walked away. </p>
<p>We had a tentative plan to visit a local temple today, and since this is officially Bryn's day off — Sunday in the States — he decided he could take a few hours off this morning. I had time to hang up a load of wash on the line when I got home, as Akane had taken Mirei to school, and then the three of us were to meet at the bus stop close to the house. We took just one bus to the temple, a fifteen minute ride perhaps, and I took a few photos of the neighbourhood ... a tall skinny building that looked as though it belonged in Amsterdam, a coffee roasting store, and a very large and distinctive old wooden restaurant. </p>
<p>I ended up with a lot of photos today, as the temple grounds we went to were so very interesting. The "Temple of Great Virtue" was founded in 1319, and consists of a main temple and twenty-three smaller ones, called sub-temples, I believe. Only four of these smaller temples are open to the public, and we went through two of them at a very leisurely pace.</p>
<p> Since this temple is known as a place to view at its best in the fall, when red leaves cover the gardens and walkways, it was very quiet, as most people are off seeing the temples with the cherry blossoms. Once we leave our neighbourhood and get closer into the main part of Kyoto, we see lots of Causcasion tourists, a rare breed in the "country" were we are. We hope to see one of the temples with the blossoms too, but today I was so happy strolling along with Akane and Bryn, walking the ancient wooden "outdoor" hallways, peering into tiny and not so tiny tatami rooms, and sitting occasionally to contemplate the gardens. </p>
<p>This particular temple is known for its earth and tile walls, and the first sub-temple we visited has what is known to be the smallest stone garden in Japan. Of course every single stone in every garden looks perfectly placed; they are all raked very early each morning, with not a ripple appearing in the perfect pattern. The second smaller temple we visited looked most untidy by comparison, as leaves were allowed to stay where they fell, and looked very unkempt on the bare earth garden areas. I'm sure this looks better when they completely cover the ground in the fall, but the mostly bare earth wasn't terribly attractive right now. I hope to be here in November, so will see it at its best then. </p>
<p>Moss has been taken to a new level at the temple gardens, although none of the photos do it justice. It's thick, lush, velvety, and picture perfect, but only when viewed in person, unfortunately. You'll just have to come to see it yourself!  </p>
<p>I love the wooden beams, the joinings, the huge wooden gates and doors, the benches  and tables, and the wooden temples themselves, most of them over five hundred years old. This first temple was absolutely perfect in every way. I think I will let the photos do the "talking" as it was all so beautiful ... the long winding pathways with stout green bamboo railings, a huge grove of bamboo, an ancient stone wash basin, a Go board used centuries ago, beautifully decorated on the outside , and well used with obvious markings on the top, and brown-robed monks walking looking unhurried and serene. </p>
<p>I had to be back to pick Riku up from school, so we left enough time for a Japanese lunch. (There was a French café right across the street from the temple with a delicious sounding menu, so I'm hoping to get back there before I leave). There was a nice little restaurant just up a block and so we went for noodles and broth. Since it was close to the temple, they had a soup with vegetarian broth and Akane, at my request, asked if I could substitute soba noodles for udon, which was no trouble at all for our very friendly waitress. The generous bowl of broth with a few tiny mushrooms, and lots of green mountain vegetables added to it was wonderful; the mountain vegetables look like tiny green beans, but very very slender and very tasty. I added freshly self-ground sesame seeds to it, some wasabi, and green onions, and ate and drank every bit of it. The tea, apparently a traditional tea served with noodle dishes, was just a bit too smokey and darkly roasted for my taste. This meal was a fitting end to our temple outing and we hope to do another next Monday. </p>
<p>We caught the bus to the end of the line here in the neighbourhood, and split up. I went off to meet Riku, and Akane and Bryn walked to a post office as we all need stamps. Riku enjoyed his lunch at school — beef stew today — and so needed only a snack at home. He did piano practice with Akane before she left to get Mirei, and Riku played with Lego in his room on his own for quite some time. I answered some emails, but am still very far behind, as usual. </p>
<p>Despite it being a much cooler day today, Mirei came into the house insisting that she was too hot, pulling off her tights and long-sleeved top as she talked, and pulling on the shorts and a short-sleeved top from the drying rack in the living room. After her snack I tried to convince her to at least wear a sweater to the playground but she would have none of it! It was a very fast visit there, with just a half hour before we had to be back for dinner, but I was so pleased we went despite that. On the big field, where there is usually a baseball game going on, there was a couple with at least two or three children, and another woman with them with another two or three children as well. The dad was kicking a soccer ball to the older children and Riku and Mirei stopped immediately to watch. Once in a while the tiniest toddler would get in the way, and the older children let him try to kick it before moving on. </p>
<p>Riku particularly was interested with it all and stood there smiling and staring at them, before deciding to just join in. It was obviously fine as the dad made it clear he was welcome. And of course if Riku is going to play, then so is Mirei! She got a couple of good kicks in, and was pleased as punch when the boys congratulated her, and she and Riku had the best time running up and down the full length of that big field, trying and succeeding in kicking the ball and just having fun with the other children ... and that nice dad. </p>
<p>Riku was so wiped when we all left at the same time, that Mirei took pity on him and offered to carry his overstuffed backpack home for him! It was heavy, but Mighty Mirei told me she had "<strong>strong muscles</strong> ... see(1)" and did indeed carry it all the way home with no complaints. Meanwhile, Riku walked along for part of the way carrying his open umbrella over his head! By the end of the walk, Mirei was carrying that as well. Before we got home, a car stopped beside us, with the woman and three children, so they could all wave goodbye to us! </p>
<p>Into the tub for a very quick splash, and then Akane had a yummy dinner on the table. Both children were tired, Bryn was upstairs working, and Akane had several phone calls to handle, so it was a little chaotic right at the end of a day that had been busy for everyone. Riku was sound asleep by 7:35, but poor Mirei had a hard time settling down tonight. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane were both busy on their computers, so I wrote post cards, and got on Bryn's computer for a half hour before turning in myself at 11 P.M. The night is colder tonight and it feels like rain.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/rainy_tuesday_1.html">Rainy Tuesday</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke woke at 5:30 this morning, bright and lively and obviously ready for his day! I, however, was none of those and rolled over for a little more sleep. Riku lay so quietly beside me,  just relaxing and no doubt busy thinking important thoughts.  :)  I don't think there are too many children that age who would be okay staying quiet for a full half hour, but I am grateful that he doesn't mind. <br />
 <br />
At six he asked me if I was awake, and I stayed in that semi-stupor for another fifteen minutes, before reading to him and listening to his dream. We could hear rain falling, my first since arriving. It's a relaxing sound for sure, and I could easily have drifted back to sleep.<br />
 <br />
Riku walked to school carrying his school-mandated bright lime green umbrella, although I didn't know that at the time, and so was amazed to see about 75% of the same colour in the umbrella stand outside his classroom. And what fun to see all those bright colours moving across the bridge at our meeting point at 1:30. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it turned out that Riku had someone else's, with no name sticker on it, so I can see why so many of the other children in the other classes are carrying varying colours! Grade one is the first year of school here, so I guess by grade two the mothers have figured out it makes sense to not have the same colours as everyone else! </p>
<p>On the way to school today, Riku asked me how one gets a "black heart". We talked about that referring to mean people, that their hearts really look like everyone else's, but it's a way of describing someone who is evil, or unkind, or just plain bad. I told him that Scrooge had a black heart, and ended up telling him the story of "The Christmas Carol". We had been walking quickly for practice, trying to keep ahead of the people behind us at the bridge, and the story ended on the long pathway beside the garden very close to the school. I wish there was some way to capture the smile on Riku's face as he envisioned Scrooge knocking on Bob Cratchet's door on Christmas morning, carrying gifts and food for all! </p>
<p>How I love our walks to school together, and it is one of the things I was already missing in San Franciso, and will miss the most about our time here together. He mentioned the story again later that afternoon, and I'm sure it's the kind of thing he thinks about when he's quiet and on his own. </p>
<p>Riku had a couple of complaints today ... the teacher told him he had to walk faster (I must say the other children do walk at a much speedier pace than our meanderer!), and one boy in his class called him a name. Riku has decided he doesn't like him. We talked again about ignoring people who say mean things and he told me that is what he is going to do from now on. It's a hard lesson to learn, when feelings are hurt.</p>
<p>He enjoyed his school lunch and ate it all, he reported; how wonderful that Akane doesn't have to figure out what to give him to eat, as all too often he just didn't bother much with it. I think he always felt rushed and so didn't put much effort into eating. However, he seems to like these hot lunches, and today it was fish, vegetables, and rice, with milk to drink. It seems that perhaps they get dessert only on Fridays, as he did say he had some kind of apple dessert last week. None since then though, but he eats lots of fruit at home, and would absolutely eat that first if they served it to him with his lunch! </p>
<p>And then on to the newly independent boy telling me that tomorrow he wants me <strong>not</strong> to meet him at the usual spot for pick up! We agreed that I would be somewhere on the next street after he turns right. It would be wonderful if he felt confident enough to do this on his own before I leave in four plus weeks. That's our goal. </p>
<p>Once home, I showed Riku a fun video of a crowd of people dancing in the train station in Antwerp to the tune of one of his favourite songs ... "Do, a deer, a female deer ...". He was still humming it a few hours later. </p>
<p>The one and a half hours before Bryn and I left to meet Mirei passed quickly. Riku played upstairs with his Lego for the longest time, and Bryn joined him for a bit too. I went upstairs when he asked for help in picking up the Lego, and told him how his dad, when he was Riku's age, didn't like picking up his Lego pieces on his own either. I told him we solved the problem by putting all his Lego on a big sheet, and when it was clean-up time he just had to gather all the corners together and put it in the big brown plastic bucket that we still have in SF. He likes hearing these stories, and often wants me to repeat them to him until he can tell them himself. He's a "family" boy for sure!</p>
<p>After that, Riku read a few pages of his choice of an English book to Bryn; it's on his "to do" list for every day. Riku is a good reader and likes to read, but likes it much better if it doesn't happen after dinner, when he is tired. He so looks forward to a story being read to him at bedtime. </p>
<p>Mirei came down the steps at school today looking a little glum (tired), but cheered up when we told her we were going for a snack. On the way to finding one (the little patisserie near the school is closed on Tuesdays), she nibbled at the little cheese crackers I had for her. Not far from the corner store, her teacher passed by on his bike, and turned back to say goodbye to her. Oh my, she was pleased! Some of the older children getting into cars with their parents also said goodbye to her in French, using her name. She always smiles but acts a little shy, and once we are past them tells me, "She is in my French school!" </p>
<p>Mirei is always hungry at pick-up. One day last week she told us they had donuts for a snack, but Akane talked to the teacher the next day or two, and was told it was all her                imagination, as they don't get any food between meals, as is the French tradition. This was news to me, but apparently snacks are never given, so that time between lunch at noon and being met at 4, is a long time for this girl who is used to one or two hearty snacks in that time period!. She wolfed down her round pizza bun in no time, both times Bryn and I picked her up. </p>
<p>Browsing in a corner store (there are  7–11s here too!) with Mirei is such fun! Walking there   she told me she wanted bread, but once inside headed right for the custard/pudding aisle, choosing one that appealed to me too ... coconut yogurt as it turned out, not a soft yogurt, but one made with coconut milk and slightly gelatinous (perhaps from the coconut). I bought that for her, and Bryn bought a tuna rice ball, which she didn't touch, and some fries which she nibbled on. Really she just wanted to get home and get to that coconut treat! </p>
<p>The bus was hot and crowded but a very kind woman gave us her seat, and Bryn got the seat beside us; we were so lucky as it was packed like sardines in there. Mirei held onto that container all the way home! The closer we got to home the harder it was for her to keep her eyes open, though; we don't think she napped at school today, and how we wish we could be flies on the wall and see what she did instead. Bryn carried her home from the bus spot, and as they went along she lost first one boot, and then the other! She thought that was pretty funny, and of course knew I would pick them up. At the corner Bryn took off one of her socks, and then the other, and had her giggling away by the time they got home. He knows how to keep his girl happy! </p>
<p>Riku was happy to see her, and off they went to play upstairs. Akane was making a light dinner of rice and veggies for us, with chicken added to theirs, so when it was close to dinner time, I popped Riku in the tub. Mirei decided that she would not have a bath tonight, a first for her since I arrived, and so Riku had the tub to himself.</p>
<p>Bryn then had some quiet time with Mirei, and she read all the letters in English out to her dad on the covers and sometimes the backs of various books. She is good at this and getting better, as she has a great memory for such details. More and more often she is recognizing lower case letters and points out the upper case letters to Bryn, telling him, "That is the same as this." It's fun for her, and she likes the idea that she too has to do homework. Riku is happy there is none for him yet! </p>
<p>Mirei is practicing her counting in French. It's pretty darned cute hearing her say the numbers herself, listen to her Daddy, repeat them, and then come in to tell me how to say it. And she often tells us that "This is Japanese" or "This is English", just to make sure we are keeping track too. </p>
<p>The children were finished dinner by 6:15, Riku did some written spelling homework with Bryn, and then had more play time again before tuck-in at 7 P.M. Oh, that coconut "yogurt" ... I had a bite and liked it, as did Bryn, and between Mirei ("I will share with you Riku") and Riku they polished off the good-sized container for snack and dessert. </p>
<p>Riku told me he was going to sleep upstairs tonight, so Bryn read to him and tucked him in , and Akane took MIrei up not long after to join them. All four fell asleep together and I had the downstairs to myself from 7:30 until I went to bed at 11. I wrote lots of emails, and it was great to catch up. Patrizia had written from Italy, and it was so nice hearing from her. (she is one of my doula moms, and one day I hope to visit her and her family at their new home.</p>
<p>Today was the first day we didn't get to the playground ...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/another_busy_day_and_a_big_day.html">Another Busy Day ... and a Big One for Riku!</a></h2>
								<p>My day ... Riku literally up with the birds again this morning, smiling over me at 5:45! I didn't have the heart to put him off for too long though, and so we chatted and snuggled until it was time for me to shower. We were out the door at 8:05, perfect timing, as I am trying to get Riku to walk just a little faster, but not at a breakneck speed either. This got us to school today at 8:20, and we bid adieu at the back door of his classroom. I now have a little collection of students who regularly speak to me in English, and I look forward to this, both at school and the playground too. </p>
<p>Bryn told me when I got home that Mirei, both yesterday and today, not long after we left,  was ready at their front door, waiting for Akane to take her to school. Bryn gets quite a chuckle out of seeing this: Mirei standing patiently, with her "packpack" in place, admiring herself in the mirror in the hallway ... it makes me smile to think of it. </p>
<p>Riku had reminded me that today I would meet him around the corner at afternoon pickup, so I was about two blocks away when the little group of four students, and one adult "escort", turned into the street. My guess is that if no adult is waiting after the crosslight, then they are accompanied until there is an adult present. This won't go on for very long probably, but it's nice to know it happens. The fellow who was with them bowed when he spotted me.  I bowed back to him and said "arigatou gozaimasu", (the "u" after the first word extends the "o" sound, and at the end of the second word is silent), one of the few Japanese phrases I know. I wish my memory for new language were better, but I have far better luck remembering the French words I learned in grade nine! Riku was at the <strong>front</strong> of the group today for the first time! </p>
<p>We stopped, at Riku's request, at that little playground where we met, for about twenty minutes. Until the 1:30 pickup began, we were always in a hurry to get home for lunch. Now he has lunch just before dismissal.</p>
<p>Riku's confidence continues to grow, and today he carefully explained to me exactly where to place my hands and feet, if I ever did want to climb to the top of the rusting metal structure here. He was a bit nervous about going right to the top the first time, and took an easy way over to get there, but after that he was roaring to go, over and over and over again, albeit still carefully. </p>
<p>Riku is a helper at school this week during lunch, and I heard about it for the first time today! He loves doing it; he and two or perhaps three other students put on long white aprons and white cotton facemasks and carry in the rice or bread or milk to the other students. Riku said he wished he were the boss of the kitchen, as he would like to do this all the time! How I wish I could get in there and take some photos! </p>
<p>After a snack at home, Riku asked if he could play with Yuu-kun, a boy from his class who lives just a few houses up the street. Bryn was preparing to take him over to ask if they could get together here, when Akane walked in with Mirei, home early on Wednesday. He was happy to have the Japanese speaker home! Akane said they would need to make an appointment before this could happen, so they went off to do that, and came home with Yuu-kun in tow! </p>
<p>Riku was just thrilled to bits. Not too much later Ayami-chan, a little girl also in grade one and a good friend of Yuu-kun's, came to join them. The house was busy with those four children (Mirei was home too, of course) running up and down the stairs, in and out of Riku's room, and back and forth into and out of the little back yard! Poor Mirei; she would just get her shoes on, and get down the steps, and in they would come. The shoes had to come off, she needed help getting up the three concrete blocks into the house, and kept busy trying to keep up with them all! It was such fun for Riku, and I do hope that he and Yuu-kun become friends. Mirei is a big fan of Yuu-kun's, as well as a huge flirt!</p>
<p>Mirei and I went off to the playground while Riku did his piano practice, and spotted Yuu-kun and Ayami-chan on their bicycles. The children all seem to learn to ride bikes early here, and they are roaring up and down the road, winding their way around pedestrians and not seeming to mind the cars honking at them. It's a little scary to think that the next time I am here, Riku will no doubt be riding along with them! There are no sidewalks in this area, and the roads are narrow. Oh, and they don't wear helmets either!</p>
<p>Mirei was happy to be outside, and had insisted she change into her "exercise clothes" before we left the house. The sun came out mid-afternoon, and she was warm enough in shorts and a little t-shirt, but she moves constantly too, so would be taking off any extra layers anyway. Today a girl loaned her a yellow ball, and we practiced catching and throwing, moved on to kicking it, and "raced" from the slide to the teeter-totters a few times too, before heading home for a warm tub. </p>
<p>Riku and Bryn went off to the playground while Mirei was occupied, and then Riku was in the tub for some quiet time on his own. We had dinner ... tofu and rice for me, curry with vegetables and beef for them, and I had to battle Mirei not to eat my tofu! I cut up a carrot for myself after dinner, and Mirei decided my raw carrot was preferable to her cooked ones. That child likes whatever is on my plate much more than what is on hers! </p>
<p>Reading time for both children tonight as usual. Mirei does love to sit beside her daddy and call out those letters. She's a fast learner for sure. Tonight she entertained us by almost counting to ten in French ... "huit" is hard for her to remember right now, but by Friday no doubt she will have it down pat! </p>
<p>Yesterday she asked Bryn why she was going to French school. Bryn told her that one day she would be able to speak French, to which Mirei replied (in English) "but I am Japanese!" Not long after that, Bryn wanted her to tell that to her mommy, so asked her to tell her mommy whether she was French or Japanese. The answer, of course, was "I'm French."! That's our girl; entertaining, and always mischievous.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/kinkakuji_old_acquaintances_an.html">Kinkaku-ji, Old Acquaintances, and New Friends</a></h2>
								<p>Greg, a friend of Akane's from Tokyo, and his mom and a friend, were in town yesterday and today. We made plans yesterday to meet them at one of the most famous temples in Kyoto, Kinkaku-ji. I will write a bit of the blurb from our tour book about it ...</p>
<blockquote>Originally built as a country retirement villa in 1397 (don't you just love that?!) for Shogun Yoshimitsu, his son, in accordance with Yoshimiutu's will, later converted it to a temple. The first floor built in "palace" style reflects the courtly elegance of the Heian period. The second floor is built in "samurai-house" style, while the third floor is bare bones "Zen temple style." </blockquote>
<blockquote>In 1950 it was burned down by a jealous monk, who believed it was too beautiful to be viewed. So, it appears to be shiny and brand new,  and the reconstruction did follow the original design. That was to have had all three stories of the temple covered with gold, but for reasons of money or time, only completed the ceiling of the third floor. </blockquote>
<blockquote>By 1987 it was completed with the gold foil, now five times thicker than the original, and was extended down to the lower floors. He was a wealthy man, who was not your typical warring samurai; he spent most of his time here in Kyoto, establishing himself as an intelligent and peaceful politician.</blockquote>
<p>Kay, Greg's delightful, quirky, and fun-loving 80-year-old mom was her charming self. I met her a few months ago in San Francisco, when she and Gregg spent a late afternoon and late evening with us. She keeps insisting that I visit her in Kyoto one day as she has room for visitors and lots of wonderful restaurants she would like to take me to. I would also very much like to meet her daughter, who sounds as fascinating and eclectic as her mom, but with a different view of life. One day perhaps... </p>
<p>Unfortunately, visitors cannot go into the temple, and all the hundreds of visitors, a huge number of them students from all over Japan, were crowded into quite a small area, once we had done the small walk around the lovely lake surrounding the temple. </p>
<p>We stopped at a homey cafe outside the temple area, and I had a most delicious fried rice dish with various (in "season") pickles. Kay insisted on me sharing her meal, so I had three fried potato wedges, and a small bowl of cabbage salad. The small upstairs restaurant was so busy, and the minute we finished our meal, the table was cleared and we were out of there! It made sense to linger over tea somewhere else. Just down the block was a coffee shop, very quiet and empty when we walked in. We had tea, and Kay insisted we have a famous chestnut and red bean dessert with it. It's very sweet and Akane and Gregg declined, but Kay, Ichiko, and I ate ours. It was served in a china tea cup, as was the tea. Cost of the single cup was $4.00 and the dessert was $6.00. </p>
<p>Akane and I headed off to pick up Riku after saying our goodbyes at the bus stop. On our way to the temple, between bus trips, we passed a patisserie with a sign outside announcing that they had pain au levain! This is our favourite bread in SF, as it is a hearty 50% whole wheat sourdough, but I think the term refers to a country style bread, with lots of substance. We made sure to stop and pick some up and found a delightful little bakery, with Edith Piaf singing in the background, and a very friendly smiling woman behind the counter. It was hard to find really good bread in Sakai, even a loaf of whole wheat, but apparently people who live here demand more and all the French bakeries are happy to oblige. More about bread another time. </p>
<p>Riku had his piano lesson today. We were at the school at 1:30 to meet him; Akane walked him to his lesson, just fifteen minutes away, and I walked home, taking his heavy backpack with me. His lesson went well and he likes his female teacher very much. Lessons here cost almost half of what they did in SF. </p>
<p>Just a block away from the house, a lovely young woman stopped me to tell me, in quite good English, that her son goes to grade one at Riku's school. There are four classes with 30 children in each, and her son is in one of the other classes. However, they live very close by, and I suggested that perhaps the two boys could play together one day. Her name is Noriko, and she has a darling little girl under one, I would guess. She was close to sleep in the stroller. I pointed out the house to her, and told her to just knock on the door and come by.  An hour later she did! Bryn answered the door, and they had a little chat. She had a gift of cookies for them, and Bryn told her that Riku was at piano and we could try another day. Her little guy was whizzing around on his bike, and I'm sure we will see him around here often. </p>
<p>Bryn thinks that perhaps many of the neighbours with children would like to have their children have a chance to speak English, and obviously the old order of not getting together until one is properly introduced has gone by the boards here, at least in this child-oriented neighbourhood! </p>
<p>The minute Riku came in, his first question was whether he could play with Yuu-kun. Luckily he was standing outside his door, so after checking with Akane, off he dashed, with a warning to not follow him too far from home! I went out as well, thinking if they wanted to go to the playground I would walk with them, even though it's obviously not something that has to be done here. The children are always out playing here and there, just as we all were when we were growing up. Yuu-kun asked if Riku could play at his house; he checked with his grandmother, who is also visiting, and off they went to his house, followed by three other children, all girls. I walked over with Mirei a half hour later, and Riku was thrilled to bits to have had this time with these new friends. His life is going to be very different here in this regard, and it makes me happy. </p>
<p>Bryn had a Mirei story for me, of course. An older woman gave up her seat to Mirei on the bus ride home, and Mirei was chatting away at full speed with Bryn standing beside her. A nearby woman was smiling away at her, obviously enjoying listening to this happy little girl, when Mirei looked up and — in perfect Japanese — asked the woman if she would like to sit beside her; Bryn said that obviously wasn't expected, that little Japanese-speaking girl!  </p>
<p>Akane had a delicious dinner prepared early for us, so the children tubbed after dinner tonight, and after Riku's reading and spelling sessions with Bryn. On the Net', Bryn had found a list of the most common English words, 220 in all, and in two days have done 30 of them. They're really easy right now, but will get a little harder as they go along. Riku enjoys doing this and loves those daddy-made stars as his reward.  :)  Mirei, too, did her "homework", naming the letters on the titles of books, and then it was bedtime. Riku was out like a light at 7:35 and Mirei not long after.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/april_17_pics_only.html">The Leader of the Pack</a></h2>
								<p>Nice slow morning around here, after my always pleasant walk to school with Riku. He reminded me once more not to meet him right at the crosswalk; he is ready to be more independent for sure. It was threatening rain, but the day was merely overcast.</p>
<p>Bryn was working out of the house at a cafe, and Akane was out after dropping Mirei at school, and so I did a little tidying up in the kitchen and in my room, and then sat emailing and blogging. </p>
<p>My new spot to meet Riku is a mere five minutes away, and so I was right on time to spot Riku leading the group of children today, with a big smile on his face. I took a photo of a group of five children before they all headed off in different directions. </p>
<p>Yuu-kun came over to visit today and the boys were busy for a long time making paper airplanes. They were flying here, there and everywhere and they had such fun with it all. </p>
<p>We had a quiet late afternoon, with piano practice for Riku, and then he and Mirei sat on the sofa while he read to her. It was the cutest thing to see and hear. </p>
<p>The children tubbed together for a long time tonight, and played with ducks, and "babies", and boats. I so enjoy tub time, and always have. We sang our favourite "Swimming, swimming, in the swimming pool..." about five times. Miei particularly gets into the action of it and Riku smiles at her as she does the There was too much splashing going on with that vigourous swimming to take my camera in there! </p>
<p>Riku was asleep so quickly tonight, sprawled out on my bed, and I crept in with my camera to capture this moment. </p>
<p>Akane fell asleep with Mirei, so I had lots of time for emails and blogging tonight. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/april_18_pics_only.html">A Very Quiet Saturday at Home</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn is working hard this weekend, with a big project on his mind, Akane has errands to run on her own, and so we had a nice quiet day just hanging about. This was fine with me and with the children too, as after breakfast and their "morning routine" — teeth, hair, face — they kept themselves busy and happy together upstairs in their room all morning. </p>
<p>Riku is constantly readjusting things in his part of the room. It's a long narrow bedroom, and he is at one end, and Mirei at the other. Riku has found places for everything that is out so far, and every time something new comes out of a box, he spends time finding the perfect place for that. He's meticulous, and knows when someone (aka Mirei) has moved something, although she pretty much knows by now that she is not allowed to do this without permission. </p>
<p>I went up to the "box" room and continued sorting. I pull out any clothes of the children's, any kitchen/household item, and continue sorting things into separate boxes for Akane, Bryn, CDs, books, and things to be dealt with down the line. The children would bounce in now and then to see if I had uncovered anything new and interesting, but for the most part they were busy with their own games. </p>
<p>One of the most popular ones right now is "cats". Usually Mirei is the cat and Riku the human, so she crawls around purring at him, and rubbing against his leg, while he pats her or puts a cushion down on the floor and tells her to nap. Mirei wants a milk dish too, and some cat toys to play with, and so it continues. When Riku gets annoyed with Mirei, his big threat is that he is not going to play cats with her ever again! </p>
<p>Riku certainly likes more quiet time on his own than his sister does. She likes to interact! It's hard for her to understand that Riku sometimes just does not want to play so she will bug him deliberately to get some kind of attention from him. It works, but not always in a positive way. Mirei and I had some story time together at one point, just to give Riku some "space". Mirei will happily sit and let me read every Caillou book in the house, and even when being read to, she is talking about the story, asking questions, pointing out things I might not have noticed, etc. One has to be a very different reader with Mirei than with Riku, who just wants to hear the story and then think about it. </p>
<p>After lunch the sun came out and it was time for some fresh air! Off we walked to the playground, and we spent an hour and a half there with no trouble at all. Mirei has inherited Riku's fondness for bugs, and will go off searching happily with him, calling if she spots a spider, or anything moving at all! They play so well together in this setting and it's a pleasure just sitting back and watching it all happen. They both enjoy drinking from the water tap there and Mirei has learned to balance carefully on the narrow edge so she can do it herself. </p>
<p>We got too hot eventually, came home, had cool snacks and drinks, and then the children went out to the front of the house to draw. I went back to unpacking boxes, and Riku decided that was a grand place to sit. </p>
<p>Akane came home and it was time for Riku to do his piano practicing, so Mirei and I went off for a walk on our own, just around a few blocks. She decided she needed to put on her "princess" dress that I brought for her from SF; she was always very fond of it, and so off we went. Mirei likes me to take her photo and poses for me very willingly. I have a sweet series of her being the dainty little girl in pink, but of course for every one of those photos Mirei likes to make a "funny face" and have me take that too. So, I am going to include that one of her, and one day all the others will be available in my "trip to Japan 2009" album! I keep thinking of how Mirei will just love seeing all these funny faces in the years to come. I hope this girl keeps smiling! </p>
<p>Once we were home, the nice young woman I met the other day, Noriko, came by to introduce herself to Akane. She has a son Riku's age, and three other children, I believe all younger. The four-year-old, she told Akane, was home on his/her own! Apparently this is not illegal or unusual, but it's not something that is going to happen in this family. </p>
<p>Usual evening routine ... a lovely dinner prepared by Akane, bath together for the children, some reading with them both, and then tuck-in time. I had a little time in the evening for emails, but spent most of it going through magazines I brought from home. </p>
<p>A lovely quiet day, and I think we will be heading out tomorrow for a trip somewhere new. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/kamigamojinja_shrine_today.html">Kamigamo-jinja Shrine Today</a></h2>
								<p>We had a nice slow easy morning with a leisurely breakfast, just hanging around for the house for the most part. I slept in for an extra hour, until 7 A.M. and needed it, and Bryn too slept in for the first time since I arrived, until 8 o'clock. His allergies have been so bad, and he's been working long hours, so it was good to know he was catching up a bit on his sleep. Riku and I read another chapter from "Phantom Toll Booth"; as Riku says each night, "We're getting there!" Riku did his reading from an English language storybook with his dad as well, so one less little chore to do when we got home later. </p>
<p>Then we were on our way; the day was hot already, at 11 A.M., as we headed for the bus stop. Akane took her bike so she could stop on the way home for groceries. The temple grounds were just perfect for the children. It is like a massive park with lots going on ... there was some fast horseback riding on a special track as we entered, lots of little places to explore, ancient wooden shrines scattered here and there, and a lovely long shaded pathway beside a fast running stream, which the children especially loved. They both found long wooden sticks to poke in the water, one of their favourite things to do, of course, and the adults enjoyed sitting on the rocks in the shade too. </p>
<p>I wandered off on my own for a bit and took lots of photos. Coming into the gates I noticed a wedding party coming in, which was so intriguing. The groom was French, but had on a traditional kimono, and I was able to join in with other photographers and take some great shots of them and their guests, in chic French outfits, and beautiful kimonos on the Japanese guests. And not long after that a second wedding party appeared. This was such fun as again I was able to join in with other folks taking photos, although at one point the couple was being photographed on a bridge, and no one except their photographer had joined them. I was there, and the groom noticed me with my camera, and said something to his bride so that she turned and gave me a lovely smile. The second shot I took will show her giving me the peace sign, something almost all Japanese children do when their picture is being taken. There was a lovely shot of cherry blossoms, and I took lots of the various wooden shrines, and their grass roofs as well. </p>
<p>It was time for lunch, and Akane suggested that we go to a Chinese restaurant about halfway home. It was fun, as we were sitting on a raised flat platform, shoes at the side on the floor, and the children both drawing as they always do while waiting for their meals to be served. They were both happy to be sitting and out of the sun too. Akane had to ask what vegetarian food they could give me, and I was very happy with my big tasty bowl of mixed vegetables with rice in a very tasty broth base. It wasn't soup, but more like a moist casserole dish, and my plan was to take half of it home for another meal. I didn't. Mirei once again impressed us with her ability to eat noodles while using adult sized chopsticks. She even attempted to pick up a croquette with them, and came close to succeeding! </p>
<p>Mirei and I came home on the bus together, Akane cycled off to pick up groceries, and Bryn and Riku went shopping for some Pokemon cards, after Riku spotted the newest neighbour's son with a pack of them. </p>
<p>Home for our usual routine of Riku reading to Bryn, piano for Riku, a short trip to the playground for Riku and Bryn, although Riku just wanted time at home, so it was a very fast trip there and back, then dinner, baths, and bed. Both children were asleep minutes after they were tucked in, Riku at 7:35 and Mirei perhaps five minutes later. Both Bryn and Akane were busy on their computers, so I went through some of the magazines I brought with me, wrote one or two very fast emails once Bryn headed up early to bed, and was in bed myself by 10:30!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/april_20_pics_only.html">A Hot Day ... Stayed Close to Home</a></h2>
								<p>I always take a quick shower before helping out in whatever way I can with the children on school mornings; sometimes I make oatmeal, sometimes cook the eggs they have each morning, and sometimes just sit with them while they eat, and then do the "morning routine" with them: hair, teeth, faces. Today when I came out dressed and ready for the day, Bryn had a perfectly cooked fried egg and delicious grainy toast waiting for me. What a treat! I usually eat after I get back from walking Riku to school. </p>
<p>The house was not the least bit cold this morning, so we knew it was going to be another hot day. I prefer this to the cold days, as the house stays cold, which means on hot days it is perfectly cool and livable inside. However, it was just fine walking Riku to school and we chatted about all the things we saw on our walk ... the gardens, what is growing, the crosswalk (where cars never stop for pedestrians but keeping driving on through), and how Riku doesn't like bicycles on the sidewalk. He thinks there should be rules about "vehicles on the roads only", but it is the law here that cars can be on the sidewalk, so we had a big talk about that. </p>
<p>Akane had left with Mirei, so I checked my emails, and wrote a few. I was quite behind as I hadn't had much computer time the past two days, so copied some blog notes too. However, there is a glitch there now, as Bryn is not able to do photos, as something broke, and now he is waiting to fix that up. He doesn't have much time either as he is working full out on both his regular job and his freelance work, so we shall see how far behind we get. </p>
<p>He is looking for some specific CDs and I volunteered to go through some more boxes, so down he came with three big ones labelled "Mirei's clothes" but weighing enough that they may contain books or CDs as well. It took a full afternoon to do this, as I was careful about the sorting ... piles for socks, tights, leggings, dresses, short-sleeved tops, clothes that are too big, and too small, etc. etc. I stacked them all neatly on the windowsill on Mirei's side of the room, and they are towering high enough that I hope they end up in the drawers soon. Clothes-horse Mirei will just love to get her hands on them! </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the CDs Bryn was hoping to find were not there. I left to pick up Riku from school at 12:30. He was hot and sweaty and very happy to hand over his heavy backpack while he skipped beside me chatting away. I always ask him about his day, but like most boys of my acquaintance, he has little to say. He doesn't know the names of many of the children in his class, but doesn't seem to mind much either, and there are other things he would rather talk about. He does like his teacher, though. </p>
<p>I went back to the sorting after Riku and I had a nice slow lunch together. He is so happy I brought veggie "bacon" with me as he is once more enjoying the little "bacon"/cheese toast he enjoyed so much in San Francisco.  </p>
<p>Akane came in about 2 P.M., Riku did his piano practice, and then they left  by bus to the ear, eye, and throat specialist for Riku, not long before Bryn left to pick Mirei up from school.  She came in with her dad looking like a tired little puppy, but she picks up pretty fast after some time to settle in. Today she enjoyed her quiet time with the little mini-fridge and accompanying food. Oh, and we found some clips for her hair, which went into her hair several ways in several different places. She is such a girly-girl, this girl! </p>
<p>Riku had four doctor appointments as part of his school check up before being admitted in the system, and it was recommended that he have excess ear wax removed from his ears. This is not an atypical problem with Asians, and Akane has it as well; due to narrow ear passages. Riku was so afraid this was going to hurt, but except for one final bit, when he cried a bit, he said it was fine. He is to go in twice a year and have this taken care of. </p>
<p>His allergies are very bad, as are Bryn's, and Akane just started sniffling too, from tree allergies. So, they both got meds for that, and also had a spray of some medication in their noses to help clear their sinuses. They are both on once-a-day Claritin too, and Riku's is to be taken in milk or non-acidic juice. </p>
<p>They didn't have to wait too long tonight (no appointments here which can go either way in terms of how long it takes to see a doctor), and were back home in time for a quick dinner of noodles and veggies. Bathtime together for the two of them, and I was reading to Riku at 7:15 p.m. </p>
<p>Akane was down from tucking Mirei in very quickly, so I made some notes and read a bit. The house is dark, though, as there is no light in the living room area right now, and it's hard to put my feet up and relax in the dining room. Bed early as a result. House still nice and cool. </p>
<p>Mom's birthday today; she was on my mind all day. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/lady_bugs_and_umbrellas.html">Lady Bugs and Umbrellas</a></h2>
								<p>It was raining lightly when walking Riku to school today, and that meant there were lots of ladybugs sitting on leaves along the main road leading to his school. We had left the house early enough to loiter a bit so that we could count the ladybugs. There were so many of them, and we didn't stop, but still got up to 34 ladybugs and two spiders! Riku was so excited and told me to remember so we could count some on the way home. </p>
<p>At 1:15, just as I was eating a delicious treat Akane had picked up for my lunch — kabocha and potato croquette and five thick slices of fried sweet potato with sticky syrup baked on them —  Bryn called to ask me to meet him and Akane at the bus stop. They had gone out together to take care of immigration papers for Bryn, and I did lots of emailing in their absence. </p>
<p>We were on our way to sit in on Riku's classroom for forty-five minutes, and it was a fun experience. The teacher is appealing in that she is very expressive, has fun with the lessons, the class is under control, even with thirty students, and she has a good sense of humour too. She's active when she's teaching, moving around quite a bit, when leading the children in questions and answers, and when checking their printing. Riku had his hand up several times, which was nice to see, and I took two shortish videos of the class in action. </p>
<p>Today was the first day the children went to school until 2:30. This is the third and final transition for them, which I so liked to see happen with these first-time-to-school children, and so very handy for Riku too to adjust. </p>
<p>On the way out of school, I spotted a trio of young girls all holding their bright lime green umbrellas. I asked if they could take their photo and they all too happily posed for me. Sweet sweet! </p>
<p>Bryn and I walked Riku home, completely forgetting about the ladybugs, as there was lots of chatting instead. He had about ten minutes for a quick snack, and was out the door with Bryn to meet Akane at the bus stop. Tonight is Riku's Chinese class, set up from last weekend's evaluation. He is in a class with a boy his age, with two Japanese parents. They had lived in China for three years where the child attended nursery school, so they want him to keep up his Chinese as well. Bryn says he is a very chatty little boy, and friendly, so this sounds good for now. It takes over two hours though to get there and back with the forty-five minute lesson, so ideally Bryn would like to hire someone to come to the house instead. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, I took my third trip in a row on my own to meet Miss Mirei at her school. I had picked up a second pizza round for her treat today on the bus, and took along some apple slices too. We have a nice little routine going here! What is the most fun is seeing her interact with the women on the bus. Today we lucked out once again, as the bus was crowded, but we found one seat right at the very back, a bench seat, and Mirei sat on my lap eating her pizza, and not missing a thing that was going on around her. </p>
<p>The woman beside me had hung her umbrella on the hand grip in front of her seat. Mirei thought that was a great idea, and insisted on hanging her own up beside the other. A few stops later another woman sat beside us; Mirei suggested to her that she too hang up <strong>her</strong> umbrella; all three of them were quite delighted with the swaying umbrellas. </p>
<p>The very sweet woman who had sat beside us on Friday was on the bus again today, and they were delighted to see each other. Mirei pointed her out to me first, but then the woman spotted Mirei and gave her a big smile. There was never an opportunity to sit beside her this trip, but we no doubt will see her again. Mirei gave out her big "bye bye!" when she left.</p>
<p>Originally the plan for dinner was to meet up somewhere after Riku's lesson, but Mirei is such a tired girl after school, and often has to be encouraged to keep those big brown eyes open! I had decided to suggest we just head home, and not try to find something to do for an hour with her. Bryn thought the same thing and called to cancel.</p>
<p>So Mirei and I had the evening to ourselves. I made pasta for our dinner with lots of carrots and cucumbers to go with it. She had dessert, a mango ice cream treat, we did a puzzle, and then it was tub time. All was well until it was time to get out and then Mirei just gave in to her long busy day and cried so hard. Then she cried again, telling me she didn't want to wear diapers with her PJs ("Diapers aren't cool, right Nana?"). She was so tired, and I hadn't expected Bryn and crew to be out so late. They walked in at 7:35 and Mirei cried once more, not wanting to stop playing with the little tiny refrigerator with tiny tiny food and dishes. It is adorable and I wouldn't have wanted to stop either! However, soon all was quiet, Riku was in his PJs and prepped for bed immediately, and was asleep by 8:10 after I read "The Boy Who Drew Cats", a lovely whimsical and yet still quite dark story by a Japanese author.</p>
<p>Akane was down not too much later but had a few things to do before settling in at her computer, so I managed to get lots of emailing done, and worked on my blog as well. Bedtime at 10:15 for me!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/a_walk_with_bryn_in_the_mornin.html">A Walk with Bryn in the Morning, and A Red-Letter Day for Riku!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku and Mirei both slept in a little later than usual, and Riku thoughtfully went to the dining room, said "good morning" to his Daddy who had been working since 1:45 A.M., and came back to bed with his book, laying quietly beside me while I took my time waking slowly. </p>
<p>We kept an eye out for ladybugs again, but there was no dew on the leaves, and we spotted only two this morning. He is getting used to his backpack, and hasn't complained about the weight of it in a few days now. In fact, Bryn offered to carry it for him yesterday and he said he was okay with it. </p>
<p>The number of children speaking to me in English continues to grow, usually starting with "Hello" and an occasional "How are you?"  too.  This morning a group of five boys asked me if I were American, and then said "Ahhh!" when I told them "from Canada". Riku volunteered that I was from San Francisco, and a couple of the children were obviously aware of that city. On the way out, I took photos of the busy courtyard filled with skippers again today. It just does my heart good to see this, as it doesn't happen so often in SF at the two or three schools I have been to. However, Amelia is skipping and loving it, and it would such fun if there were always a group she could join in with at her school. </p>
<p>After a couple of hours at home on the computer, Bryn suggested we go for a walk further north into the hills. Off we went, for a forty-five minute stroll, to discover not the hiking trails that Bryn had imagined but newly built homes tucked in just below the hills. There are some older homes too, of course, but Bryn said that homes are generally not built well enough here that they last for very long. Akane considers this house an "old" house, and it was built just twenty years ago! There were lots of garden plots, commercial size, chickens in small crated pens, and more new housing. We even saw a Western style home with a little plot of grass in the front yard, which is most usual, as usually any room outside the homes is paved over and used for parking. </p>
<p>I was keeping an eye on the clock to make sure I left in time for Riku, thinking this would be the second day of the new 2:30 departure. At 1:55 Riku walked in looking ever so pleased with himself! Yes, he had walked all the way home, with Yuu-kun, and no adult with them; we were so excited for him! He had a snack and then walked over on his own (with Bryn keeping an eye out the front door ... this can be a busy corner), to invite Yuu-kun to play. They had a great time, of course, running from one activity to another, sharing a snack, and keeping busy. </p>
<p>Mirei was at school for just a half day today, so Akane picked her up, they had udon noodles out for lunch, and did a little shopping. Mirei was delighted when she discovered Yuu-kun here; she is quite the flirty girl, and kept trying to get his attention by being affectionate, funny, or merely silly. It worked. She managed to make him laugh, and then happily followed the two boys about. </p>
<p>Usual evening routine followed ... piano practice for Riku while Mirei and I walked around four big blocks, then reading with his dad for Riku, and tubs for both the children. Akane made a delicious dinner of fried rice with vegetables, and salmon sashimi for all but me. Mirei just amazed me by eating about half of the salmon, as well as a huge bowl of the rice. Two salmon bites, rice, three pieces of salmon, and rice. At one point I suggested she leave some for Riku, so she picked up a piece, hand-fed him and went back to eating more herself. </p>
<p>As a special treat, as we were eating so early, the children got to watch various videos (from Grandpa and some songs Bryn chose) as well as a bit of "The Simpsons" on Akane's computer at the table. Riku just howled at the latter!   </p>
<p>Riku's allergies are really bad right now, he's on medication, and both children were overly tired from a later night last night, so Akane went up at 7 P.M. with Mirei and I was reading to Riku at 7, with lights out at 7:15. Over thirty-five minutes later he was still awake saying "<strong>Man!</strong> I am <strong>never</strong> going to get to sleep." I was lying there thinking about a study I read, stating that children have a hard time processing anything visually stimulating for up to three hours before bedtime; that their brains just can't shut it off. And minutes after that thought, Riku said to me "Nana, wasn't that funny when Bart was running around with no clothes on?" Okay, I'm convinced! He finally gave in at 8 o'clock!  </p>
<p>Bryn went to bed fairly early tonight, so I had access to his computer for a good long time. I was writing one final email when Riku called out for me, coughing constantly, so after two tries at getting him settled, I happily turned in early.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/one_hundred_plus_ladybugs.html">One Hundred Plus Ladybugs!</a></h2>
								<p>Yup, that's right! Even though there wasn't much dew today, the ladybugs were out in full force. Riku was counting them as fast as he could, as we moved along that last long stretch, but really hit the big time when we discovered them cozily hidden in the curve of a metal barrier that divides the road and sidewalk on the lane into the school. They were mostly congregated near the ends, and when it became obvious that we didn't have time to count them all we decided "over a hundred" in total was a good, if low, estimate. Happy boy! </p>
<p>The principal of the school is often at the gate to meet and greet the students that come in from our direction. He seems to be a very kind and gentle man, and has a big smile and cheery "good morning" for all of us. He always makes an extra comment to the younger children too, and Riku likes him very much. Today, since there were no children directly behind us, I asked if I could take Riku's photo with him; he agreed immediately and knelt down beside Riku, resulting in a very sweet pic;. </p>
<p>I had a little emailing time after my breakfast, before Akane got home from her morning trip to Mirei's school, and then did some unpacking and moving of boxes. There have been two in the dining room since the last big sorting through, and today I was determined to have no boxes left on this floor. Getting one huge box mostly unpacked and sorted in the current "storage room", really a fourth bedroom, was worth doing, as slowly but surely that room is looking bigger and emptier. </p>
<p>Bryn walked over to a favourite cafe to work for two hours this morning; he finds he gets more done without an Internet connection, and he likes to get out of the house too, and see a little bit of the world in his neighbourhood. </p>
<p>I have had two long narrow but quite thick wooden boards leaning against the wall in my room, along with two wooden bases in another spot. These came from an alteration shop that Akane knew of, and when they were renovating she got what used to be the "table" the owner worked on. The idea was to use it all for a coffee table in the living room, so I asked her if we could see if that was going to work. We fiddled around with it for a bit, and after Bryn got home, we all had the hot stir-fried lunch Akane prepared for us, Bryn did some more fiddling and came up with a very reasonable solution. It's stable, it's interesting, and it's functional too! I like old wood, and think it looks great. Now there is a place to put up our feet and a spot for a cup of tea. </p>
<p>Riku's piano lesson was today after school, so Akane went off to meet him. I know he was looking forward to walking home without a grown-up today, but I had forgotten to remind him about his lesson when I left him this morning. They were walking in the house, just as I walked out to pick up Mirei. </p>
<p>It's such a treat to see that sunny little face. She looks so little compared to the really big kids who go there, right up to high school age. There she was wearing her pink backpack, her sweet flowered pink jacket, clutching a small bag, just bursting to show me what was in it ... three bakery treats from a little girl in her class! The teacher had a newly planted bulb, just showing green above the top of the tall plastic cup it was in, ready to hand to her, and another teacher, or perhaps an aide, handed her a painting/pasting/cutting page she had done. Such a lot of fun projects for her. </p>
<p>As usual, we stopped in to buy her pizza round, caught the bus almost immediately, and sat side by side on the back seat of the bus again, but sadly did not see our "friend" or have any interesting interactions with anyone today. There was lots to see out the window though, and she was totally fascinated with the shaven head of the man in front of us! He obviously didn't speak any English or he would have been reacting to some of her comments! </p>
<p>Akane was cooking dinner when we walked in, but Mirei had to show her and daddy all her schoolwork, and tell them about her painting. And then she had to do her homework. Really! She knew she had to do it, and insisted on doing it <strong>now</strong>! Mirei is an old hand at this particular exercise; she has to trace over the letters of six different words, but instead of Japanese words, as they were at "Little Angels", they are French words. I took lots of photos of her working her way through them, and it's too cute for words. </p>
<p>We had a delicious cabbage and veg' stir-fry for dinner, mine with tofu, and the others with sausage. Riku is always happy with fruit for dessert and tonight had strawberries and pineapple, while our girl with the very sweet tooth had ice cream on a stick with chocolate bits in it. Riku had done his English spelling words with Bryn while we were out, and played the piano while his dad videoed him. Lovely.</p>
<p>Tub time, reading time for Mirei with Bryn, and Riku with me ... and he was sound asleep at 7:30 tonight. </p>
<p>It's 9:30. Bryn went to bed at 9, with his alarm set for 2:45 A.M.! Akane must have fallen asleep with Mirei, and I am going to go through some photos for the second time today before I too head off to bed. </p>
<p>p.s. The landscape photo shows Riku's school on the far left side with the playground surrounded by high fencing. I hadn't noticed the rock wall before near the front of the gardens, and quite liked it.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/field_trip_for_two_children.html">Field Trip for Two Children Today ... and Riku Lost Another Tooth!</a></h2>
								<p>Ah, I am happy to say that Riku slept until 6:20 this morning, and I slept right along with him, waking with his warm hand tucked in behind my neck. Waking couldn't be sweeter than this. </p>
<p>Mirei was up and in great spirits, ready for her first field trip. However, she had lots of time before leaving, so proceeded to take the little basket of tea towels and dish cloths from the kitchen shelf, take everything out, and carefully refold it all to her liking. She and Riku also had enough time to look at a site for French that Bryn pulled up for them, and soon they were both repeating numbers in French from one to twenty and singing "Frère Jacques" with gusto! </p>
<p>Both children took big lunches to school, and Riku's was packed in his light nylon knapsack from SF. No books today! Mirei went to the local (and famous) palace, a place I haven't been to yet, and Riku went to the Botanical Garden. We saw all the buses lined up as we walked to school this morning. By mid-morning, the sun was out and the day was warming up, so a perfect day for this. Tomorrow calls for rain. </p>
<p>Bryn was working on his computer when Akane called; Riku and a boy at school were fooling around and the boy accidentally hit Riku's mouth and his sideways-facing, so- close-to-coming-out tooth had been knocked and was bleeding. His teacher took him to the dentist, who pulled the tooth, to make more room for the two teeth trying hard to come in behind it. The teacher then took Riku on the bus to join the others.</p>
<p>Akane was out for most of the day, so there was lots of time for me to work through a backlog of emails, plus bring in and hang up another load of laundry outside. Rain expected tomorrow. </p>
<p>Riku came roaring in the door today, full of energy and the "rest of the story". Seems the tooth incident was not an accident at all. A boy in Riku's class told Riku he wanted to play with him, and when Riku said he didn't want to, the boy hit him in the mouth. His tooth bled, and Riku told the teacher, who gave the boy two "talking -to"s, Riku explained. He said he cried a little bit but not too much, and again at the dentist a bit, but not too much. He was tired from a full day out walking, so settled in with a book and some fruit to cool off. His teacher came by to tell Bryn that Riku was no doubt tired, and apologized about what had happened. Riku watched a bit of a movie, but soon was bored, and went over to invite Yuu-kun over to play for a half hour. </p>
<p>Mirei came bouncing in with her mom at 5 o'clock full of vim and vigour. She did lots of walking today, and was so tired at one point that she got a shoulder ride from her teacher and fell asleep too at some point during the day. She has not been napping as she was when she first started, but tells me she just plays with toys instead. I think she does get some quiet time too, which is just fine, as she is more than ready for bed at 7 o'clock these days. </p>
<p>We had our usual evening, with stories, spelling, tubs and dinner, a quick dinner tonight of store-bought pizza, which everyone likes, as well as cucumber and lots of cooked carrots. I had a big bowl of soup I had made yesterday as I had a big lunch today... a combination of a noodle-veggie dish Akane had made last night,  along with three tiny side dishes from a "mixed plate" Akane bought for me today. </p>
<p>Riku and I had just finished reading, turned out the light and he was settling down, when he remembered he had to put his tooth under his pillow! It's there now, waiting for the tooth fairy to come along in the night. </p>
<p>Oh, Riku looks awfully cute with those two nubby little new teeth coming through. Mirei had lots to say about teeth and how when she is big she will lose her teeth too. Oh yes, she will. I just can't imagine her being a toothless six year old! </p>
<p>Tomorrow is the weekend!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/y500_and_a_cold_rainy_day_in_k.html">¥500! and a Cold Rainy Day in Kyoto</a></h2>
								<p>So, the first thing Riku did this morning on waking was to lift up his pillow to check for that tooth fairy money and it wasn't there! He looked under both pillows, and under part of his duvet, and then said "Maybe the tooth fairy doesn't come to Japan" looking quite stricken at the thought. I assured him that she did, and told him I would be back in a minute. I checked with Bryn, who was in the dining room working, and he hadn't forgotten, it was there somewhere. Phew! When I went back in, there was the shiny Y500 coin just under Riku's knee! He was so excited, and started talking about which Lego set he would buy with it. </p>
<p>It was just pouring rain when we woke, and "it's the weekend"! No fair. Back in San Francisco, Mirei had learned to count the days of the week, Monday to Friday on her fingers, saying, as she pointed to each finger "This is Monday, this is Tuesday, this is Wednesday, this is Thursday, this is Friday" ... and then holding up two fingers to say, "And this is the weekend!" So, considering how much we all look forward to it, I think we deserve sunshine!  </p>
<p>Riku is even more excited about weekends here than he was in California, as he went to a Japanese school there on Saturday mornings from 9-12. He had fun, once he got there, but the thought of going was never appealing to him. We heard a lot of "Oh man, school again?" and "It's not <strong>fair</strong>!" from him, so he is just loving having these two days to just hang about in the mornings. When we're together, that has always meant an extra chapter of his book, telling each other our dreams, or a new story, while keeping warm under the blankets. </p>
<p>Today I was the one silently moaning as yesterday Akane had Googled to see if there was anything to do in Kyoto with children, and there is ... lots of temples and shrines, but of course all requiring a dry day to wander about the grounds. </p>
<p>We did have a nice slow breakfast together, though, with the children playing at the table for a nice long time. No push to get out the door, so time for looking at books, drawing, and puzzles. I enjoyed a very long shower, with time to wash my hair, scrub my feet, cut my nails, and not having to dash through it all with a time slot in mind. </p>
<p>It seemed reasonable to get Riku's daily English reading done early, so he and his Dad went upstairs for some quiet time together, then Riku had a break before piano practice. </p>
<p>Riku has been asking for his Lego magazines for a while now, as they are still packed in a box and there are lots of boxes to look through!  I had told him I would try hard to find them today (with no luck), but did make a valiant effort at it. </p>
<p>He and Mirei had lots of fun playing in their room, which is like a giant playroom right now with no beds set up yet. They kept coming in to the fourth bedroom (aka "storage room" right now), across from their room and discovering "new" things that I was uncovering ... a doll, stuffed animals, and tiny purses and "jewelry" for Mirei, and wooden trucks and tools and empty boxes(!) for Riku. </p>
<p>And, just when I was wondering what we could do for the rest of the day, the phone rang. It was the mother of a child from Mirei's French nursery school, inviting Akane and the children over for lunch and a play date! The just-turned-four-year-old little girl, Kako, was a favourite playmate of Mirei's, and yesterday was her last day at the school. She is going to be going to a Japanese nursery school from now on, so this was just such good timing. </p>
<p>Kako conveniently has two older brothers, one five and one eight, I believe. It was great to have piano and reading done with for the day, as they got picked up at noon and arrived home at 5 P.M.! </p>
<p>When the mom came to pick them up, Bryn said her children were piled in the back of the van like Labrador puppies, but he went out and buckled in Riku and Mirei. It's interesting that I have seen very few locals cross against a light, even when there is no car in sight, and yet despite the seat belt laws no one seems to pay much attention to them. </p>
<p>I finished unpacking two big boxes, and had a nice set of boxes organized for each of the household member's belongings, when I stopped for lunch. I polished off a mixed plate of delicious little tidbits Akane had picked up for me, and it was so good with a big hot cup of tea (it was <strong>cold</strong>). The house was chilly all day.  I then spent three and a half solid hours catching up on a huge number of emails and writing up yesterday's blog. </p>
<p>Bryn and I went out for a walk at four o'clock to pick up butter and milk, and doubled back after checking out prices at the 7/11 store and the small grocery store nearby. Milk was cheaper at the former and butter available only at the latter. I had another hour on the computer, until Akane and the children arrived home. </p>
<p>Bryn had dinner ready when they walked in the door ...  delicious pasta with the usual array of cooked and fresh veggies. I am very much enjoying the meals that Akane and Bryn prepare, and I don't miss cooking one little bit. </p>
<p>They had all had a great time, and were excited and very tired from hours of interacting with other children for such a long period. Then it was bath time after dinner; each child had a personal slow-down time, although Mirei used hers figuring out new ways to tie her mommy's hair towel around her. While Riku bathed, Mirei did her "homework", calling out letters to Bryn, and then before long it was bed time for these two children, both asleep by 7:30, although Riku was breathing so heavily with his allergies I wondered how he was sleeping at all. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn left at 7:40 for a movie their first since moving here in mid-March. It was a Chinese movie, directed by John Loo, called 'Red Cliff  Part 2", based on a true story. It was in Chinese with Japanese sub-titles, and they both enjoyed it very much. Bryn especially so when he learned that he has misheard Akane and the tickets were not $24 each, but $12! They were home about 11:30 and so I had lots of extra time going through photos, answering emails, blogging, and reading for a bit in bed before turning at 11 P.M. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/rainy_morning_lists_and_a_sunn.html">Rainy Morning, Lists, and a Sunny Break in the Afternoon!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku and I had just wakened at 6:40 when Mirei peeked in, happily announcing to her mom "They're awake!" before tumbling onto our bed to join us. We have a nice cozy bed and it's plenty big enough for three. We stayed in there for twenty minutes, snuggling, and talking and giggling, and then it was time to get up and on with our day. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn slept in for a rare change, so I got their morning fruit bowls ready (Bryn almost always does this), and made their porridge with strawberries too. They always have three courses in the morning but love nothing more than a break between the second and third, not easy during the weekday rush to get off to school. The children decided to make a "feast" for their mom and dad with the tiny food products they have been collecting over that past few years. It was fun to watch them decide on what fish, vegetables, fruit, bread products, sushi, and desserts to serve them, and I must say it was a huge wonderfully assorted breakfast they prepared. It took them the better part of an hour to put it all together! </p>
<p>Bryn prepared a "to do list" for the children while he was having breakfast. It was quite extensive, especially Riku's (!), and reminded me of the lists my dad would make for us each Saturday morning, on long sheets of lined paper. Ours, however, never did have "ball/Frisbee" on it, but more mundane things like "wash kitchen floor", "clean bedrooms", and "finish ironing"! I must say we were not six and three years old either! </p>
<p>So, Riku's list was: piano A.M., piano P.M., spelling, letter to Kai, reading, drawing for Kai, Chinese, ball, and frisbee.  He got through it pretty darned quickly, with his morning piano practice over after breakfast, as well as spelling with his dad, and reading to his dad. </p>
<p>Mirei's list was shorter of course: Chinese alphabet, counting one to twenty in French along with a friendly teacher on YouTube, recognizing her letters from A-Z in English (she's reading book titles right now, thus the upper case), being read to, and practicing her printing. She is doing just great in all of these, and of course loves to be told that it's time for her "homework". </p>
<p>Riku had written a letter to his classroom in San Francisco yesterday and drawn a picture of his new house to enclose with it, so he and Bryn took their umbrellas and went off to mail that. Bryn headed off to a café to work this morning, even though it is his day off. Perhaps if the sun had been out we might have gone off to find something to do together. It seemed a perfect day to make cookies, but we have only a microwave here, and most homes do not have a full oven anyway. Somehow it seemed an oatmeal/raisin cookie baking day! </p>
<p>Mirei and I had some time alone in my room while Riku did his piano practice. He had a hard time settling down to it today, not fun for anyone. Bryn was home soon after that for a hot udon noodle and cabbage lunch Akane had prepared, after which they decided to go off to run some errands. </p>
<p>It was time to get out for some fresh air and exercise, and the rain stopped just in the nick of time for this! The children and I headed off for the playground, despite the damp sand and play equipment, but stopped to see if Yuu-kun would like to join us. He did, and we had such a great time. Riku took his Frisbee along, and the four of us played together. Riku enjoyed being the timemaster, and when he held up a long green branch of leaves it was our signal to throw that Frisbee! Mirei enjoyed both trying to catch it, and trying to throw it, and Yuu-kun was very patient with her. The boys played alone together too, and Mirei did a little digging in the sandbox, wishing she had her sand toys, not yet out of a packed box. We were out for an hour and forty minutes, and it was sweet to watch Mirei walking home hand in hand with Yuu-kun. </p>
<p>Two blocks from home, we met Kiko and Pieter, the couple we met on the day of the neighbourhood parade on Easter weekend. It was lovely to see them, and while we decided we would try to get together for a cup of tea with each other, somehow there was some stepping-on-shoes going on between Pieter and Mirei! Riku joined in, then Kiko! It was such fun for the children and they loved it that the adults thought they were so fast at it! There is something very special about being in a foreign land and running into familiar faces. </p>
<p>The fun continued at home, and the next hour and a half flew by too. Riku wrote his letter to a former classmate/pal at his Saturday Japanese group in San Francisco, and did a great picture of a sign in front of a restaurant that he and Bryn had passed on their walk yesterday. </p>
<p>Mirei had been practicing her numbers in four different languages over and over, keeping herself busy and happy while doing so. I told her I wanted to video her, and Riku decided he would like to introduce her. This took it to a whole new level! We did four "takes", the first two without the camera, and then got it rolling. </p>
<p>Riku was as cute as could be, as he practiced how he would introduce her several times. He also took charge of where she would stand, and would "pull" her out on stage, often kissing her on the top of her head as he stood behind her coaching her. The first time through it was strictly the numbers, which she did like a pro. The second time he decided to ask her a couple of questions, and by the third time, when I recorded it all, he had a whole raft of questions he was asking, and had forgotten the original theme was numbers! It was all too funny and very sweet. As soon as Bryn can get to emptying my card from the camera I shall post it. </p>
<p>Did some emailing, but also am working my way through some magazines I brought with me, so read a few articles, and wrote down the titles of some new books, before settling in for the night at 11 P.M. </p>
<p>p.s. Yes, Mirei got to check off all the chores on her list too! Bryn was very pleased that Riku got all his done as well, even though we substituted "playground" for the "ball" portion of it. </p>
<p>p.p.s. I must remember the way Mirei currently pronounces W, as it makes me smile every time I hear it. Duh-you-boo.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/two_week_break_for_mirei_our_s.html">Two Week Break for Mirei, Our Snowman Woman, Space, and Black Holes!</a></h2>
								<p>It's Monday and the first week day off for Mirei since I arrived. We will have lots of hours to spend together, and I am a little worried about how to fill in the hours without my usual array of things we did in San Francisco. We were lucky and I know it with so many fun and interesting playgrounds close by, Mirei's favourite Bay Area Discovery Museum, and the beaches. And Mirei was always happy playing with anything at all i the back garden too, riding her tricycle, picking up rocks, helping me weed and sweep, etc. etc. </p>
<p>However, it's the first day and it was fun just not having to say a quick goodbye to her as I dashed out the door with Riku! After eating the third portion of her breakfast with a video playing (a rare treat for her... she watched Caillou in German!, the only language Akane could find of the particular Caillou episode Mirei decided she wanted to watch), off we went for a walk to the local shopping area. </p>
<p>After checking out the slowly filling pea pods, we were lucky enough to spot our favourite "local", the woman we now call the "snowman" lady, because of the snowmen marching around her skirt. Today, however, she was wearing a long skirt made up of crocheted squares. Quite the colorful character! She kindly allowed me to take a photo of her with Mirei. We were out for a full hour, heading home before the rain hit. We made it, but the clothes on the line got wet and then dry again when the sun came out later. </p>
<p>Akane made a curry dish for Mirei today, and Mirei got right to work polishing it off, enjoying every bite of it. And then Akane sat down at the table with her own bowl of noodles and veggies, and that looked much more appealing to Miss Mirei. I took a series of photos showing every step of this funny scenario... Mirei peering into Akane's bowl, looking sad at her own bowl, smiling her big smile when the trade was made, enjoying the new dish, and then going through the whole routine again until she was back to her own curry. What a character she is! </p>
<p>Riku was home long enough to do his piano practice, have a snack, and so do some spelling with Bryn before leaving with Akane for a doctor's appointment. Mirei and I decided to walk with them for two blocks, and then continue on, but this little girl just burst into tears when she saw them turn off in a different direction. She was tired, and it showed, as she sat right down in the middle of the "sidewalk" refusing to move. Her nose was running, but she wouldn't let me wipe it, she went "boneless" on me, and just cried and cried. Eventually she agreed to let me carry her home, and was her perky happy self in no time. </p>
<p>Riku has a sinus infection and was given some antibiotics and a one-a-day allergy tablet. He and Mirei had a little time together and spent some time pretending that Riku was showing Mirei something on a computer at "Grandpa's house". </p>
<p>Tub time right after dinner, and then an early bed for them both. Akane had bought Riku a book about space, written in Japanese, so we had a good look at that before he was tucked in. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/april_28_pics_only.html">Songs, Spaghetti, and Sorting</a></h2>
								<p>Lovely walk to school with Riku today. Every day he asks "Are we late?" and we have never been late, but what he really means is do we have to rush to school, or can we meander? This was a meandering day, although we have a new strategy for keeping up our pace... we try to not let anyone behind us at the bridge catch up with us. It sometimes doesn't work, of course, as often a group of older children will scootch by us, but for the most part we can take those little peeks behind, and move just a little faster. </p>
<p>After learning that we could bake cookies in the combination oven, Akane and I decided we would go off to one of the larger grocery stores in the area to try to find vanilla, baking soda and baking powder, and flour at a better price. She wasn't sure that some of those things would be sold in the smaller local store here. </p>
<p>We didn't dash out the door, but had breakfast first, Akane hung out some laundry, and Mirei listened to the first twenty or so songs on the CD that Doug had sent to her. This little girl loves to sing and has a great memory for learning new songs quickly, and today that was "Oh, Do You Know the Muffin Man...". I was lucky to have a mom who sang to me, as so many of these songs were ever so familiar! </p>
<p>We walked to the bus stop, the first stop on the route for three or four bus routes, and passed a huge long line of bikes. The buses are well used, and busy, and the bikes are used by those commuting by bus to work or school. I just had time for a quick photo of some of them, when Mirei told me to hurry, the bus was coming. It wasn't, but she wanted to make sure I guess that I wouldn't miss it. This was my first time on the number 37 bus, and I bought a day pass for Y500 (approx. $5.00) as we were going to stop on the way to go to a whole foods store to stock up a bit on some veggie food for me. </p>
<p>It was a small store, so Mirei was free to wander, looking at all the packages and occasionally coming over to see if she could buy it. One of the items was for wafer biscuits, but tiny squares, instead of the long thin wafers my grandmother bought for me. They went into my basket along with a kilo of brown rice, some "meatballs" just for fun, a package of risotto, ready to cook, and a veggie "burger" which I will try on the wonderfully dense loaf of whole grain bread that was on sale for 50% off, due to the Golden Days holiday tomorrow. It was so good that we wished we had bought three loaves of it! Bryn and I especially liked it, a fabulous caraway seed loaf. </p>
<p>We peeked into a bike store to see about a bike helmet for Mirei, as she could go in the basket on Akane's bike, once she has a helmet. They didn't have the right size in the right style, but Mirei sure looked cute trying them on. Her favourites were, of course, the pink ones. </p>
<p>Back on the bus, and it was close enough to lunch when we arrived that I suggested we eat right away. There happened to be an Italian restaurant just inside the door where we entered, we checked the menu which was just fine for me, and the prices were very reasonable too. My entree was about $5.50, and there is no tax or tip required in Japan. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the laws in Japan still allow smoking in public places, and there were enough smokers in the restaurant that it wasn't the perfect lunch. However, I had ordered spaghetti in a tomato/cream sauce, which was just delicious. Yum! Akane chose a pasta with egg and ham to share with Mirei. </p>
<p>Mirei had decided in her own mind how she wanted to break that egg (it came with a partially cooked egg on the top to be stirred in to form a sauce), and burst into tears when Akane did it, before Mirei could tell her mom she wanted to do it herself. She burst into tears and then was so angry that she refused to eat one bite and wouldn't try mine either. This is such unusual behaviour for Mirei; she always behaves incredibly well when out in public, and likes to be out in the world too, so she was either overly hungry or tired out, probably the former, as she asked to nurse and was asleep in two minutes! </p>
<p>I knew we would not be sitting there long enough for Mirei to have the nap she needed, so I picked up all our bags, and Akane carried her out of the restaurant... where she burst into angry tears, of course! Fifteen minutes was not enough sleep! I wish I could have taken a photo of her, as it was the most pitiful thing... nose running, refusing to have it wiped, sitting on the floor just to the side of the opening to the restaurant, refusing to budge, and sobbing loudly. Poor wee girl! I suggested Akane go off for a few minutes as she was a reminder that all that Mirei needed was a quiet spot with her mom! I talked to her quietly, got rebuffed a lot, then less so, and within ten minutes, we were walking towards the grocery store. </p>
<p>And to make it even better, the mall provided shoppers with child oriented "cars". We spotted a little girl with a pink one, which I was sure that Mirei would want, and my heart dropped a little when Akane came towards us with an Ultraman car instead. However, Mirei was pleased as punch and we had a very pleasant grocery store experience. About fifteen minutes later, we heard a little child crying. Mirei wanted to see what was wrong, and so we peeked down the aisle and saw a little girl sitting on the floor, crying hard. Mirei's comment? "She's pro'ly tired." Yup, I agreed. We found everything we needed, bought more than we really could carry, and were happy to be at the terminal for the buses, so we all got seats! Mirei was fading fast toward the end of the trip, but those little square wafer biscuits and some almonds and cashews I had with me did the trick. We arrived home just after 2 p.m. </p>
<p>Akane and I were both ready for hot cups of tea, Akane's first Co-Op food order was delivered, I answered some emails, while Mirei got to open a present from Auntie Susan and Kevin! It was a lovely pink T-shirt with a yellow carousel horse on the front, short sleeved, and it went on her immediately. She sat at the table with me, and "wrote" a thank you note, printing MIREI in the corner after drawing a few circles and whatevers. She wanted to do her "homework" after that, and printed the letters W, B, and R. I love the serious look on her face, with her tongue sticking out, ala Gram. </p>
<p>Yuu-kun was here to play with Riku at 2:40, and of course Mirei was happy to tag along after them, running to keep up and get Yuu-kun's attention. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/a_midweek_break_for_riku_space.html">A Mid-Week Break for Riku, Space, Vincent and a Nest-Builder</a></h2>
								<p>This is the beginning of "Golden Week", a Japanese spring break, so Riku had today off from school. We were lying in bed looking through the new book on space that Akane had bought for him last night, when Mirei joined us. How I wish I had set up a tape recorder as I sat listening to these two cuddled together in my cozy bed. Here is a bit of the scenario and dialogue... "Mirei, do you want to learn about space?" "Yes Riku, I do." Riku closes the book, and says "Mirei, I want you to think about space for a minute. Close your eyes." and watching her, says again "Mirei, close your eyes." When she has done his bidding, he said "I want you to think about space for a minute. Imagine millions of stars." This went on for some time, with Riku opening the book, showing her a picture, telling her about it, and continuing on. He sounded so much like his daddy! </p>
<p>Gail called to say hello to Riku, as he was at school when she called and spoke to Mirei. However, Riku's hearing is not good, thanks to those stuffed up sinus passages so I ended up chatting with her instead after he gave up. </p>
<p>We all ate breakfast together today, a rare event, and it was just wonderful. Riku had drawn a picture with lots and lots of stars, and an astronomer way down below, looking upward. I told him it reminded me of a painting by a famous man called Vincent Van Gogh who also painted stars. Bryn found the painting on the Net' I was referring to and showed him some others as well, including his small but tidy room.</p>
<p> I ended up telling Riku a bit about his life... his medical problem with his ears, his supportive brother,  how he loved to paint the stars and flowers. That led to the lovely song by Don McLean called "Vincent" but that I always call "Starry Starry Night". </p>
<p>After breakfast it was piano practice and spelling time for Riku, so Mirei and I went to my room with Akane's computer and spent all our time there looking at videos of her and the other children... at the beach with Amelia and Riku, Mirei with Riku when she was very young, not yet walking, her cousins in Toronto, birthday parties with Auntie Susan, Kevin, Mari, baby Finn, Brent. Riku joined us when he was finished, chuckling once more over the video that his cousin Bryn.</p>
<p>Pieter, the friendly neighbour we met two weeks ago, stopped by with four lovely big ripe tomatoes for us, and had some time to chat with Bryn too. He told Bryn about a shuttle to the airport which sounds a much cheaper, faster, and more comfortable trip than the trains/bus route they have been using. Riku asked Pieter where his girlfriend was, which made Pieter laugh; Kiku is his wife, and the children like her too. </p>
<p>After lunch, I took the children to the playground up the street. It was hot and the children explored a little trail at the far side, finding lots of flowers and bugs to check out. It was just the quiet time outdoors that both children love. There was time for a little Frisbee throwing although at one point, the Frisbee went into a gated pool area with a high fence around it. Riku, to my surprise, walked down to a dad tossing balls to his son, and asked him if he could get it for him! We all clapped after he made that climb on our behalf. Riku found some boys on that lower level with collectible cards, and sat down and joined them, again to my surprise. They were very generous about letting him handle them, they chatted with him too, and let Mirei look at the cards too when they went off to a shadier spot themselves. </p>
<p>We got home to find empty boxes at the foot of the stairs, and Akane and Bryn upstairs sorting through more. Bryn had set the children's colourful rug on the floor, and their twin beds up in their room, although until there are shades covering up their many windows, they likely won't be sleeping in there. It gets so light so early! But, that set Riku off sorting and rearranging all the toys/bins/and boxes of his belongings. He is a boy  that takes after his Nana; he wants his things organized asap, and enjoys doing it. He's a nest-builder for certain! Mirei was happily sitting on her bed, making up a smaller bed for her babies, and tucking them in. She too is a nest builder too in her own female way.</p>
<p>And then followed... Riku's second piano practice (he missed last night), and I had some computer time while Mirei did her homework. naming her letters with her dad, and enjoyed some story time with him too. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn walked out to find a desk, and the children had some playtime together with a big yellow plastic bus, a gift from Riku's third or fourth birthday. Akane made big bowls of noodles, broth and veggies for the children's dinner, they had a long shower together with their dad, and I got them ready for bed. Riku had been playing with his robot and hated to stop, but I promised him he could have it first thing in the morning. The last thing he said to me was "Are you sure you will remember?"</p>
<p>The desk was delivered tonight (!), right up to the bedroom/study (free delivery, as this was, or very cheap delivery service is very common here, but it's Sunday and the delivery was after 6 P.M., so I was very impressed!)</p>
<p>Bryn made Akane and me toasted tomato sandwiches for dinner and did up the dishes. What a treat! Akane fell asleep with Mirei at 7:45, Bryn was working in his new office upstairs, and I had lots of time to go through photos, answer emails, and blog! What a productive and fun day for all!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/04/a_dozen_a_bakers_dozen_and_mir.html">A Dozen, a Baker's Dozen, and Mirei is Printing "Nana"!</a></h2>
								<p>This morning on the way to school I spotted a ladybug in the bushes again, and pointed it out to Riku. We didn't have much meandering time but in the short distance we still had to walk, Riku spotted twelve in total. I pointed out to him that made a dozen, a new--to-him term, and then told him about a baker's dozen when he found one final one. He liked the idea of a "free" extra. I told him of course about that extra cookie or donut at the bakers when I was growing up. </p>
<p>Mirei and I took another long walk today, this time with the goal of buying "sultana biscuits" as they were known when I was a little girl. Mom would almost always pick up a large package of them on Thursday night (our grocery night), and the entire family liked them except Don. He called them "crackers with bugs in them."! I spotted them on our last walk but hadn't taken money with me. </p>
<p>Today Mirei asked if she could take her babies for a walk too, so off we went with two babies in a tiny stroller. Mirei had a pack on her back, and a sweet funny pink purse Auntie Candy had sent along for her, so she looked quite the part of the overburdened mother! </p>
<p>We met Yuu-kun's grandmother (Baba) on our way there, and said "hello" in Japanese to lots of friendly people. Mirei has an opinion, and not favourable ones, about every person who doesn't reply to her! They are, in her humble opinion, one of the following... mean, not happy, not nice, and she always tells me she doesn't like those people. I have never understood how anyone can totally ignore a friendly child's greeting, but they're still out there.</p>
<p>Mirei and I were wandering around looking and ran into Akane! She had gone out earlier on her bike, and stopped in for a few items too. After saying goodbye, we continued with our shopping spree and lucked out. Mirei chose two containers of creme caramel, for her and Riku, we bought two packages of the cookies, much smaller than ours at home, and then lucked out when we spotted a small bag of half-sized marshmallows! I was going to bring some with me for our hot chocolate the next time I visited, so we were very excited to find these here. </p>
<p>I took a few photos in the store... of a single cob of corn, shrunk wrapped in plastic, and of some carrots, and noted the prices of some everyday items too. And then Mirei carefully took all our food and placed it on the check out counter; how disappointed we were to learn they don't take credit cards there and had to leave it all behind! The corner stores do, as did one of the larger grocery stores on Tuesday, but this particular one is cash only. I carried home the stroller and babies, as Mirei was tired of all the work by then. </p>
<p>We went out for lunch, had some quiet time, and when Akane and Bryn left at 1:15 to meet Riku at school and walk with him to his piano lesson, Mirei and I headed out to the local playground. For the first time ever, we were the only ones there for the entire time! We threw and rolled the ball we took along to each other, and Mirei sat on my lap in the shade for the longest time while we watched all the ants scurrying here and there right below our feet. At 2:45 we decided we could walk toward the river and see if we could meet up with Riku and his parents at the bridge. It was a long walk for this little girl and she yawned about four times, so we went right home after not spotting our crew. They were home already, having taken a different way home. </p>
<p>Riku had a nice long evening to himself tonight, which he thoroughly enjoyed. He read to me before his tub, early tubs for them both, and long ones too. Riku was the last out and he and I spent five minutes squirting water at each other from narrow nozzled plastic thingies, each time I opened the door to the tub area. My guess is we will be playing this game until I leave. We started it last night, and he's pretty sneaky, as he got out of the tub at one point, hiding behind the accordion door, so I was a very handy target! </p>
<p>Akane prepared a delicious dinner with spring cabbage lightly cooked, with tofu strips, a rice/barley mix which she noticed Riku has at school, lots of tiny cucumber slices, sushi for them (Riku got Bryn's one piece!),  a big bowl of fresh tofu cooked in a tasty broth (which Mirei and I both particularly liked), and a small bowl of kabocha squash, cut in fine strips, with onion, and thinly sliced potato, all in a golden miso broth. </p>
<p>We were nice and early and ahead of schedule for our usual evening routine, so Riku was allowed to read all through dinner. He did a great job eating, but was totally concentrating on his book between bites. I know what a pleasure that is, to just read and relax while eating, and it's a rare treat for sure for Riku.</p>
<p>Mirei has been printing her name very nicely now for four days, and tonight I showed her how to print "NANA". She did the most amazing job with it, and then wrote it from memory, on the opposite side of the paper, but writing NAAN instead, but she remembered all the letters so we were impressed anyway. She had insisted on "doing my homework" while Riku did his spelling list with Bryn... twenty-five words with some new ones mixed in tonight, and a happy boy with his 25/25 score! </p>
<p>Riku was asleep tonight at 7:45, and I slept until 8:15!! Akane had fallen asleep with Mirei, so I got busy with emails and my blog, finishing off the night by going through a massive number of photos to get them down to just six per blog. Bryn has the program working to get photos again, and I am very excited to have it done! Still lots to catch up on with those pics, but slowly but surely they will get done. It's just so darned hard to choose those six though...  </p>
<p>Mirei woke again tonight, crying. Still sick with a heavy cold, and tonight her Daddy is sick too with another sinus infection, it seems. Riku, happily, is improving!</p>
