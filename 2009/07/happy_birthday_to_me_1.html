								<h2>Happy Birthday to Me!</h2>
								<p>My first call of the day started off with a lovely phone call, complete with a rousing rendition of "Happy Birthday to You!" from Amelia, Finn, Susan, and Kevin. I had been lying in bed earlier thinking they would be the first to call, since Amelia is going to a summer camp this week and wouldn't be home until later on. So, it was with delight that I heard those voices first thing in the morning. </p>
<p>My second call of the day was from Judith Sarkany. It has been months since we connected and it took us over an hour and a half to even start to get caught up! By the time we said goodbye, it was time to eat, and get ready to head for the airport. </p>
<p>I wrote in my previous blog entry about Bryn and Riku's arrival and my day with Riku after that, ending with all the fun Riku had at the playground on 23rd Street in the Mission. Here is the rest of the story ... </p>
<p>Bryn and Doug picked us up at the playground about 5:15, and asked if we would like to have dinner at "Little Star" pizzeria, one of our favourite pizza spots, although we usually take the pizza home. This is always a very busy spot, but we lucked out and got a table right away. Riku spent the time drawing a very elaborate picture of a hammock with all the details of a lazy afternoon included... a bowl of fresh fruit, a purse, sunglasses, drinks, table, palm tree. Sweet!  We all enjoyed every bite of our two different types of deep dish pizza, and then headed for home. </p>
<p>Bryn had a lovely bouquet of flowers for me, and there was a delicious spice/carrot cake from "Just Desserts" on our traditional crystal platter, used since the very first year of our marriage. Riku was thrilled to bits with the celebration, and grinned his way through the candle blowing and the unwrapping of the gifts. </p>
<p>Doug gave me a gift that made Riku happy too, three different kinds of hot chocolate mix, including one with marshmallows. I was delighted with the nice assortment of my semi-annual collection of books, tea from Nova Scotia, as well as a soft scarf in the blue Nova Scotia plaid. I also got a new and quite adorable toothbrush holder for travelling; it has a little face on it, and sticks to the mirror so the toothbrush can dry out, and yet is protected too. </p>
<p>Bryn made a fresh pot of tea, we all enjoyed the cake, and then it was tuck-n time for Riku, sound asleep at 9 P.M., later than I had hoped this first night, but asleep in minutes, thank goodness. This jet lag business can be tough! </p>
<p>I had missed three birthday phone calls while I was out, but all three left recordings, which is always fun. I taped them and will get to hear them many times again this way! All were singing messages too, from Kelly, Gregg, & Caillie, Gail & Tom, and Candy, Tara, Rick perhaps but included Kaitlin & Lauren too, so I wasn't sure. I did talk with Sheldon and Donna in the afternoon, and Marie called as well. </p>
<p>There were also lots of birthday wishes on Facebook, many email messages and cards, and a lovely group of cards on the mantel as well. My favourites are always the homemade cards, and this year there was one from Amelia, a sweet bunnies drawing, signed by her family, of course, and the card that Riku made this morning. </p>
<p>I always think about the call my mom made to me each year on the 29th. Depending on when she called, she would fill me in on what was going on so many years ago at that time ... for example, "Thirty three years ago, I was just an hour away from finding out that your brothers had a little sister." And she always ended the story with my birth "at eleven A.M.,on a beautiful Sunday morning when the church bells were ringing", and the nurses put me into a pale green nightie as they thought it suited my red hair. Touching memories from all those yesterdays... and today. </p>
<p>It was a lovely birthday!</p>
