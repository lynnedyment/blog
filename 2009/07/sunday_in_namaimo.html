								<h2>Lazy Sunday in Namaimo</h2>
								<p>Ahhhhh, this was such a relaxing day for all of us. Doug wasn't sitting behind the wheel of the car, Tom wasn't sweating away in the front seat, wishing he could open his window far enough that Gail and I didn't request the windows stay up a bit more, and Gail and I had some room to stretch our legs after two days in that back seat! </p>
<p>Gail and I started off our day with our usual breakfast, thanks to the stop for the veggie "bacon", and of course played a few hands of cards before the day really got started. Eventually she and Tom went off to Costco to stock up the fridge with lots of fresh fruit, veggies, and staples. I caught up on a few emails and blogs, while Doug stretched out on the deck, reading away the hours. </p>
<p>After our late lunch together, Gail and I got busy in the kitchen. All the groceries got put away and thank goodness they have an extra fridge downstairs for all the boxes of cherries, raspberries, blueberries, etc. Once we had some counter space cleared, Gail made up a huge fruit bowl, and I sliced the five or six loaves of sourdough bread for the freezer.</p>
<p>Doug was finishing up a book on the deck, and Tom looked up and taped some of their favourite shows before settling in with his book. </p>
<p>Our intention was to get out for a walk today, but we ended up not doing that, busy with all the other things to do. Gail and I did take some time for some family tree work, though, as well as checking emails, and more blog writing for me. </p>
<p>I couldn't resist taking a photo of Gail's messy bed, still piled with clothes, while ours was as neat as a pin from the time we awoke this morning. Not often that this happens! Gail laughed when I showed her the photos, and soon her room was as tidy as usual.</p>
<p>We had a delicious dinner, prepared by Gail of wonderful tender corn on the cob, and wild salmon, grilled on the barbecue, after marinating in a mango and ginger mixture that Tom had picked up along his travels. Yum! I'm hoping to get in at least one or two more salmon dinners while we're here. </p>
