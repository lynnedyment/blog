								<h2>The Big Push is On!</h2>
								<p>Knowing a few days ago that Bryn and Riku were going to be arriving on my birthday, the decision was made to leave for B.C. on Friday morning, rather than on Sunday as originally planned, which means that we are just one day away from leaving. We have accomplished so much in the house, but of course could have used another few days to do all that we hoped to. So today was another day that Gail and I just worked hard all day, trying to get as much done as we could inside the house as well. It's looking great, but today was the day to tackle the framed photos, the paintings, and the framed prints in the upstairs hallway just outside our bedroom door. They have been there longer than I care to admit, not being sure just where to safely store them until the day that there is room on walls to hang them. </p>
<p>First we had to take everything out of a spacious crawl space in behind the wall where our clothes hang. When Gail was here in early December, we had prepared the house for not only Christmas decorating, but for Bryn and family moving in with us for three months, by clearing all our collectibles and chicken collection from all the shelves in five rooms on the main level. Once all that was cleared out and vacuumed today, I realized that this flat dry space would be a perfect temporary home for the mass of frames. It was a huge job, as there are a lot of them, but they all went in easily after I had placed them in untied huge plastic bags.</p>
<p>Gail and I took turns vacuuming and cleaning the wall where they had been leaning for so long, and then I did a final sort of the toys that could be stored in another out-of-the-way area, leaving our room looking more like our bedroom and less like a play area. I imagine it's going to take us a while to get used to how wide and spacious this area looks now. Doug suggested we turn it into a bowling lane!  </p>
<p>While Gail and I were busy inside, Doug and Tom were cutting up long boards that had been part of a barrier between our back garden and our downstair neighbour's access to our garden. It was originally put up to keep their dog out of the garden, but that is no longer necessary and I was anxious to reclaim the area. Now it is longer and roomier, and just looks so much better. This makes it look like it had for many years, and I am so pleased with it all. </p>
<p>Doug and Tom had gone out for lunch today at a spot downtown they both enjoy so much: "neatloaf" sandwiches at Ananda Fuara. Gail and I had our two cold salads for our lunch, taboulleh and Greek salad, with some sourdough toast to soak up the juices. Yum!  Of course we stopped for tea and cards midway though the afternoon. </p>
<p>I actually went to bed early tonight, although it didn't help at all. My mind was whirling with all that the summer holds and into my busy fall as well. </p>
<p>I took only one photo of Gail doing a final sweep in the garden today (with what appears to be a green mustache!), and I so wish I had before and after photos of all that we accomplished together upstairs. </p>
