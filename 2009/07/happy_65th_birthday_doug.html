								<h2>Happy 65th Birthday, Doug!</h2>
								<p>Susan, Kevin, and the children called early and sang a boisterous "Happy Birthday" to Doug. I was making his all time favourite cake ... a cheesecake. The original plan for today had been in place for at least three weeks; two musical acts he was interested in seeing were playing today at the Marin County Fair, and we knew Tom would be interested as well. We left a little later than we planned to, after a very relaxed lazy morning at home, which included lunch too. Bad timing, as it turned out there was a huge traffic jam on the long road that leads to the Golden Gate bridge, and Doug was sure we would not make it in time to see the first act. So new plans were hastily made. </p>
<p>Since we were not too far from another outing we had planned for some time to see, we drove to the Presidio to see the Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy's latest piece of art in San Francisco. It is called "The Spire" and is a beautiful wooden structure made up of many trees that had been cut down for reforestation at the old Army base. It is magnificent, ninety feet tall, and the idea is that one day it will be surrounded by all the new growth of trees now being planted. After admiring it from every angle, we went to an exhibit featuring his other works; his books were on display, and we watched excerpts from the wonderful film made about him several years ago called "Rivers and Tides", plus some new footage on the installation of The Spire. Gail and Tom hadn't heard of him, and were duly impressed. We have plans to take them to see his other two art works in the area, one at the DeYoung Museum, and the other at Stanford University. </p>
<p>Tom was curious about the beautiful dome he could see as we left that area, and so we drove to the Academy of Fine Arts, built for the World's Fair held here in the early 1900s I believe. The dome isn't a cover for a building but is part of what appears to be Roman ruins. I have never walked in and around there myself and so it was very interesting for all of us. It's beautiful, with lovely statuary, high arches, beautiful carvings, a big pond with swans swimming, and a gorgeous view of the Bay. The sun was out and it was a perfect day to see this. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom suggested we go out for dinner at a restaurant of Doug's choice, an extra gift for his 65th birthday, and so he chose one I predicted he would ... Basil Thai. We stopped in at the house long enough for a phone call from Kelly, before heading out for dinner at 6 P.M.</p>
<p>We shared two appetizers ... Gail and I tofu with peanut sauce on skewers, grilled to perfection, and Doug and Tom shared grilled scallops on skewers. Gail and I also shared two dishes, both so tasty ... one an eggplant and tofu dish, and the other a tofu and mushroom dish;  Doug and Tom both had the Pad Thai with prawns, and they ate every bite of theirs as well. What a lovely treat this was! </p>
<p>Doug had lots of messages in today, wishing him a happy birthday, and it was lovely to hear his computer "ring", as we knew it was going to be Bryn and the children calling. Sure enough, in a minute we saw those two little faces on the computer screen, singing "Happy Birthday" with their dad. Mirei likes to dominate the screen, and tried amusing us by pulling her face in as many silly ways that she could think of. She and Riku both laughed when Doug rolled his eyes and got just as silly. Bryn literally had to carry Mirei away from the computer so her brother could have a couple of minutes to say hello to everyone. </p>
<p>We were all too full for cheesecake, so Gail and I played cards and had our tea, Doug and Tom kept themselves busy, and about 8 o'clock we settled in at the kitchen table for a wee party. Gail and Tom gave him three humourous Canadian books (short stories) and a music CD, also Canadian. Susan and Kevin gave him maple caramels and two books as well, along with tickets for two to see their authors ... Wally Shaw in one case, and Nick Hornby in the other. Both will be "in conversation" in San Francisco in October. Bryn and Akane gave him a Japanese furoshiki: a square of heavy cloth that he has mention of on his <a href="http://www.onebag.com/"><u>OneBag</u></a> site. He had admired it less than two weeks ago, and I had sent a message suggesting it would be a perfect birthday gift. It's from a famous store in Kyoto too, which makes it even more special. Kelly and Gregg gave him a movie card for the Landmark Cinema, always a perfect gift for him. And I gifted three certificates for restaurants in Nanaimo, for our upcoming visit there.</p>
<p>It wasn't the birthday that we had planned, but the day was slow and relaxing, and was celebrated on the right day too! </p>
