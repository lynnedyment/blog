								<h2>Penny's Palapa, a Long Walk Home, and Some Disturbing News from the Falls</h2>
								<p>I slept in until 7:45 this morning, which seems to have settled in as being my usual wake-up time here. Gail was up and on the computer when I walked in the room, and had been up for an hour and a half. She had our fresh fruit bowls ready to eat on the balcony on this warm and sunny morning,  and I was so lazy I was the last to shower, at 11 o'clock today! I got busy with emails and finished up a couple of blogs before finally getting ready to go out. </p>
<p>I had given Doug three gift certificates for his birthday this year, all for meals at some of our favourite places to eat in Nanaimo. We had decided today was the perfect day for brunch, as the weather is warm and dry enough for outdoor eating, and it's a weekday so we assumed it wouldn't be too busy at "Penny's Palapa" on the waterfront. We were surprised to find only one table for four available when we arrived just before noon, but the service was good and we didn't have to wait too long for our brunch. Gail and Doug always have the huevos rancheros; Tom had his usual too, a breakfast burrito; and I had a vegetarian plate with a new addition this year: a strip of marinated and grilled tofu. All the meals were as tasty as always! </p>
<p>We walked up into the main business section of Nanaimo, where Doug and I stopped in to ask a few questions about our retirement funds in the local bank. It was lovely and cool in there (and so hot outside by this time!), and we didn't mind at all that we had to wait a bit before we were seen. However, despite the heat, Gail and I decided to walk home along the seawall, and rushed a bit, as we had the key for the house, and didn't want Tom and Doug sitting waiting for us after they poked into a few bookstores. We enjoyed our walk; it was as lovely as always  walking along, enjoying the water views, complete with seaplanes buzzing into and out of the harbour.</p>
<p>We were home for an hour, had our tea and cards, and were checking emails when Tom and Doug walked in. The rest of the afternoon and early evening passed quickly. Doug is whipping through a book or more a day, enjoying his leisure time in the living room or on the deck, Tom is reading and watching TV, and Gail keeps busy with a few household chores, as well as helping me get more names into the family tree from her sources, and planning and making lunches and dinners. She and I were not very hungry after our big brunches, but I had a small plate of the wonderful Greek and tabbouleh salads she had made up earlier, complete with fresh mint from her container garden on the deck. Tom and Doug each had a simple but tasty meal of tofu dogs and beans.  </p>
<p>Gail and I were playing cards at 7 o'clock when the phone rang. We had been hoping to hear from Candy at some point this evening, as she and Rick had driven to the Falls today to spend a week with Beth and Paul. However, as soon as Gail heard her voice she knew something was wrong, and it was. When Candy and Rick pulled up to the house, instead of Paul and Beth waiting on the porch for them, it was Wendy and Paul. Beth had chest pains this morning and has asked Carol to take her to the hospital. Beth must have been very frightened for her to suggest such a thing, and so now she is in Cardiac ICU, hooked up to various tubes, and waiting to hear whether or not she suffered a mild heart attack, had an angina attack, or whether there was something else going on. Now we have to wait until tomorrow to see how our baby sister is. </p>
<p>We were all tired from the heat and anxious about Beth, so we went to fairly bed early, even me(!) ... in bed at 11 P.M. </p>
