								<h2>Off to the South Bay and Stone River</h2>
								<p>Gail and I enjoyed our usual long breakfast with tea and cards, and then got to work ... together sorting out the set of rolling drawers in the laundry room that contain all of my cards, envelopes, note paper, stickers and craft items for the children, and post cards. We did a great job and it is once again organized and tidy. </p>
<p>Soon after Doug returned home from his T'ai Chi class we all headed out to "The Valley", south of San Francisco. Gail is always so happy to do this trip, as she can rely on it being hot and sunny there. This is one of the reasons that Doug and I tend to avoid a trip there, as hot and sunny is not our favourite thing. We were all happy today as the high was only 76F, hot enough for Gail, and not too high for Tom, Doug, and me. </p>
<p>After a leisurely drive through the lovely, spacious, well kept grounds of Stanford University, with all the impressive old buildings, and new students and their parents wandering the well worn pathways, Doug and Tom dropped Gail and me off at the quite lovely outdoor mall very close by the university. They were off for fish burritos at one of Doug's favourite places for lunch in that area, and Gail and I were planning to wander about the shops and see what appealed to us there. </p>
<p>My favourite spot, a huge deluxe grocery store with wonderful take out foods, breads, drinks, and desserts has closed, so we decided on tasty baguettes with buffalo mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, and basil from a nearby patisserie. We ate outside with the tallest cups of tea that Starbucks serves, and enjoyed every bit of it: the food, the tea, and the setting. Lots of flowers at this mall, and some interesting shops. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug met us two hours later and we had our photo taken under the most wonderful-smelling huge flower display. </p>
<p>It was just a short drive from there to our third Andy Goldsworthy structure, one of my favourites so far, called "Stone River". We had been there twice before, once with Akane, Bryn, and Riku, and it's as impressive each and every time. Gail and Tom enjoyed it too, strolling along admiring the carefully placed stones. We took lots of photos, of course. </p>
<p>We took a few minutes to wander through the Rodin sculpture garden next to the nearby art gallery, and were amazed when it started to rain! We don't really expect rain here until late October or November, so the drops falling from the sky came as quite a surprise. It didn't last long, of course ...; too bad as everything could use a little freshening up in the area. </p>
<p>Doug and I used to drive to the valley often, and one of the things we liked to do on our way home was stop at Webb Ranch, long known for its tasty and reasonably priced organic produce. The ranch is on Stanford University grounds, which I had not known, and the produce was every bit as good as I remembered it. Gail and Tom bought lots of delicious fresh fruit and vegetables — peas in the pod, avocados, plums, a huge melon — and we bought corn, tomatoes, and other veggies too. Summer time and the eating is easy! </p>
<p>We drove home along 280, enjoying the views of the fields and cows, and not too much traffic either. After putting away all the produce, we had a quick dinner of a stuffed "chicken" filet with cranberries and goat cheese (Gail and me), veggie "buffalo wings" for Doug and Tom, and corn on the cob for all. It was a little early for it so the cobs weren't very big but the flavour was divine. </p>
<p>Amazingly it started to rain quite heavily, and the party the neighbours were having moved inside. Gail and I played cards, Doug and Tom went up to watch a music video, and Gail and I had some time on the two computers for the family tree. </p>
<p>Gorgeous sunset after the rain! </p>
<p>I stayed up much too late working through some genealogy "hints"... </p>
