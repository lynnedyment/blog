								<h2>Family Tree Time, Chores, and More Family Tree Time</h2>
								<p>Tom and Doug headed off together early this morning for a 10 o'clock movie about John Dillinger. Gail and I had already eaten, had our tea and cards, and tidied the kitchen, so the minute they were out the door we were at the computer for a couple of solid hours' work on our family trees. We both enjoy this so much and are getting lots of new relatives in with documented historical facts for so many of them. The time flew by! </p>
<p>Before we knew it, the boys were back with their lunch,  shrimp "PoBoy" sandwiches from a bar a few blocks from us. Doug had read a piece in the paper a month or so ago about "great sandwiches in San Francisco", and Jack's Bar was on the list for these particular sandwiches. The shrimp PoBoys appealed to both Doug and Tom, and they came home with huge bundled packages for their lunch. They hadn't realized they would be so big, so each ate only half of these breaded and deep fried shrimp, tucked into a tasty crusty white roll, with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and mayo tucked in. </p>
<p>Gail and I joined them at the table, eating our bowls of fresh fruit with yogurt; we had our carbs this morning! However, we thought we might like to try one of the veggie PoBoys tomorrow. </p>
<p>I had told Gail about a wonderful British movie from many years ago, and Doug had put it at the top of our Netflix list on Friday. So, off we went upstairs with big bowls of popcorn, followed by big cups of tea, to settle in and watch Mike Leigh's "Secrets and Lies". I enjoyed it every bit as much today as I did over ten years ago, and Gail just loved it. I was so pleased, as I had watched it  with Mom and Auntie Rita, who both enjoyed it so much, as did Doug when we first saw it together. Gail had a few tears, but good ones.</p>
<p>After the movie, we got right to work on clearing/cleaning and sorting out the laundry room. I had some shelf paper that wasn't quite long enough for the shelf above the washer and dryer, but Gail finagled it to fit; it looks so much better than the bare wood.  I went through all the toys stored in that room, tossed some of them, and reorganized all the rest of them. No shortage of children's toys in this house! Gail swept up over the tall ceiling and down the walls, and we thoroughly vacuumed it after removing everything from the room. We got it almost all finished just before Doug walked in from his class. </p>
<p>I did try to talk Gail into a walk a few times today, but she insisted it be an at-home day, and so it was. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug finished off their Po'Boys for dinner, Gail and I had fruit bowls with vanilla yogurt, sunflower seeds and crushed flax seeds (with a mixed nut meal for me as well ... yum!) and when the men decided to watch another music video, Gail and I settled in for more family tree work. Gail had brought several pages of a new family for me, so she read it off while I typed it in.  A wonderful way to end our evening, with lots accomplished today. </p>
