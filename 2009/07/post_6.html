								<h2>An (Unexpected!) Early Birthday Party with Friends</h2>
								<p>A few weeks ago, Gail had arranged a luncheon at her home and invited Judi and Jody for our once-a-year visit together. Gail had the menu all arranged: a fresh tomato and bread salad, cheese, olives, hummous and thin crusty bread, and, at the last moment, a small bowl of our freshly made clam chowder too. </p>
<p>I asked a couple of times about dessert, and Gail mysteriously said it was all taken care of, and was a surprise. I was sure she was going to send Tom out for some special treat, but he was in the house with us all morning. I was curious as to why Jody, our always loyal cake maker, wasn't baking a cake. Gail mumbled that she might just be too busy with the B&B. </p>
<p>Judi arrived on the 10:10 ferry, and Tom and Doug went down to pick her up. The boys went off for lunch and to run some errands, while Gail, Judi, and I sat chatting, waiting for Jody. I finally called her, as it was just past noon, and she said all she had to do was pack up the cake and she would be on her way! The gig was up; she was bringing my birthday cake(!) with her, and it was to have been a surprise for me. It was for sure! I hadn't given my birthday a thought this early. </p>
<p>We sat and caught up a bit on our news, and then had our lunch. I was really hungry by this time, and enjoyed every bite of my food, especially the delicious chiffon cake with orange peel, beautifully decorated with white icing and a huge flower. It tasted as delicious as it looked! </p>
<p>I even got lots of unexpected gifts(!) ... homemade jams and jellies from Judi, my old favourite empire biscuits Judi had somehow managed to find, cookie cutters to make my own biscuits(!), a lovely candle, a big gorgeous bar of pear soap, and birthday cards too. Gail had already treated me to lots of early birthday gifts, but she found a perfect book for me, a comedy, about a traveller in Japan. Lucky me! </p>
<p>Settling down in the living room with our tea and wine, the afternoon just disappeared. Judi missed the 5:30 ferry back and so we had another two hours together. It was lovely on the deck by this time; the morning had been a little cooler, and it was just a great way to end our time together. </p>
<p>Gail had made Tom and Doug dinner around 5:30, even taking the time to prepare what turned out to be a really tasty lobster thermidor-style dish, using the lobster from Bayfield in P.E.I, and baking it with a little parmesan cheese after mixing it in a light cream sauce. Doug was thrilled to bits with it, and Tom enjoyed it too. </p>
<p>It was a perfectly relaxing day, and a wonderful last day here. I did pack up my suitcase which didn't take long, but vetoed the original plan Doug had suggested for leaving ... on a 6:30 A.M. ferry, which meant leaving at 5:30. We decided that leaving on the 7:55 was just fine; this is the second last day of our holiday after all! </p>
