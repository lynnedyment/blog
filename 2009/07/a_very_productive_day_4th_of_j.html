								<h2>A Very Productive Day — 4th of July at Home</h2>
								<p>We had all sorts of ideas about what to do with our day today: go to the Marin County Fair, as there were two acts that would be interesting to see, or perhaps walk around the reservoir if the sun poked through the early morning fog. When we decided against the first, it made sense for Doug and Tom to go to a movie they both want to see, but by the time the decision was made, it was just a little bit too late for that. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gail and I decided that whatever we did, it wouldn't happen this morning, so we got right to work at the biggest household job on my invisible list: clearing off the four deep multi-level shelves that make up my "linen closet" in the hallway upstairs. I knew it was going to be a huge job, and have been putting it off for far too long, waiting to have some help here to tackle it with me. It took the two of us two full hours, and now I wish I had taken a "before" and "after" photo! It looks amazing and we cleared out three massive trash bags filled  with duvets, top sheets, pillow cases, and blankets. Some were well worn, some rarely used for various reasons, and some I just plain did not like. Doug and Tom took them off to the Sally Ann and the man at the reception was very very grateful to have them! </p>
<p>It had been decided that Doug and Tom would stop for Vietnamese sandwiches on the way home, as neither Gail nor Tom have tried them before. We had also managed to get a basket of toys sorted out, with some to give away and some to toss, and I finished cleaning up the toy stove I had started working on the other day. So, we were more than ready for lunch, and were very happy that Doug had talked us out of sharing the sandwiches ... marinated tofu in a very crusty tasty roll, on a bed of grated carrot, cilantro, a special dressing, and some jalepeño peppers for a taste surprise!  All of us but Tom took the latter off, as they are bloody hot, but we all like the little zing that they leave behind on the sandwich.Oh, the sandwiches are a bargain at $3.00 each! </p>
<p>Gail and I did manage to sneak in a few games of cards here and there: after breakfast, after we finished up each job, and of course a few other times during the day too. Sometimes we made a pot of tea and then had to have two or three games while we sipped away. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug went off to Amoeba records, followed by a peek at Kezar Stadium, both on Tom's to-do list. On the way home, they stopped in at Mitchell's Creamery for a big container of macapuno (young coconut) ice cream, a favourite of us all. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gail and I had decided to take an afternoon break, and watch a wonderful documentary Doug and I had watched the night before they arrived. I watched a bit of the beginning again while sitting on the bed, but also did some clearing/cleaning in my room while enjoying it for a second time. This worked well, since I effortlessly got through my two bedside drawers, and a three-shelf unit holding sweaters, albums, and jewelry. </p>
<p>Before we knew it, it was dinner time! I am sorry we didn't get out for a long walk, as the day was warm and sunny and it would have been perfect. However, we are planning on being out most of tomorrow, and Gail suggested we just get something big accomplished today. Since the time went by so quickly it was just great to see how much we did. </p>
<p>Susan had dropped in with a bag of perishables this morning, on their way to Yosemite for the week, so Tom had some of her delicious homemade beef and noodle stew, Gail, Doug, and I had French onion soup, and we all had a big spinach salad, with cheesecake later on for dessert. While we were waiting for the dinners to heat, Gail and I prepared a huge fresh fruit salad, using a combination of fruits from our fridge and Susan's. It looked so good when we finished I couldn't resist snapping a photo of it! </p>
<p>Quiet evening ... Gail and I went up after dinner and watched some interviews done at the very end of the movie we had watched earlier ("Watermarks"), a documentary that focused on a group of female swimming champions from Vienna, filmed sixty-five years after fleeing Austria to evade the Nazis. The women were all so amazing ... strong, vibrant, healthy, opinionated, talented, and almost all with a great sense of humour, but always slightly coloured by what that time had done to them and to their families. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom read, Doug was working on the computer, and I caught up on some emails. All this evening fireworks have been blazing across the sky, accompanied by loud booms reverberating over the hills. Happy 4th! </p>
