								<h2><a href="/2009/07/an_even_bigger_gardening_crew.html">The Entire Doering/Ellis Gardening Crew Arrives!</a></h2>
								<p>Kevin has the week off work and Susan had suggested they all come over today and work in the garden with me. However, since "the parents" rarely have any alone time together, I urged her to drop the children off and for the two of them to go out for brunch, or a walk, or whatever. After thinking about it for a couple of minutes, Susan said she would take me up on it after all, as a friend in Alaska had suggested they check out a caf√© on on Folsom Street, I believe. This worked out beautifully for all of us. </p>
<p>The children had some free play time at the house, before they started "working", and both got on the little vehicles in the garden, with Finn following Amelia everywhere she went on the trike. She moved to the little wooden deck, and Finn picked up his push car and followed her there. They did have fun bumping into each other! </p>
<p>Finally Amelia decided to start trimming the plants, which of course meant that Finn wanted to use the shears. To distract him, I suggested he put some peanuts out for the blue jay. When he did manage to get hold of the shears, he sat down and took his time crushing the peanuts up into bits, and with my permission even ate a few of them. We were all clicking away up into the trees, and were successful in drawing the blue jay to carefully swoop down to peck away and carry off a peanut bit. He doesn't always come around when we call, so we were delighted with his appearance today. </p>
<p>Both children were ready for some porridge with blueberries about 11 o'clock, so we decided to go upstairs to eat while Amelia watched one episode of "Casper, the Friendly Ghost". I fed Finn while he played happily with Bryn's Fisher-Price farm, bought when Bryn was two years old... 39 years ago! When he opened the left hand door and heard the cow mooing, he leaned way in and said "Where is it?" Amelia went over and explained it to him, but he never did give up on trying to spot that elusive cow! </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin arrived not much later, and since they never arrive empty-handed, we all sat at the table and enjoyed fresh "Goat Hill" pizza for lunch and a sweet yellow watermelon for dessert. Delicious! I could not believe how much of that pizza Finn ate, as he had finished an entire bowl of cereal not an hour beforehand.</p>
<p>After lunch we all got right to work. Susan did lots of clipping, making a huge inroad into the overgrowth of persistent ivy and asparagus fern, Kevin made sure Finn didn't fall down the steep steps at the side of the house, and helped Amelia in her little corner, where she was trying hard to match the huge pile of debris we hadn't been able to put in the compost bin last night. I weeded and swept, and took a few photos of it all too. The pile has grown higher and higher today.The garden looks so so much better, and it's all thanks to Susan and her hard work and enthusiasm, and her great crew of willing helpers! </p>
<p>p.s. Before leaving, Finn found the box of necklaces in the toy basket, and put on as many as he could before it was time to leave. </p>
<p>p.p.s. Not long after they left, Susan sent me a sweet photo from her iPhone. Yes, they worked hard! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/gail_and_tom_arrive.html">Gail and Tom Arrive!</a></h2>
								<p>Doug went off at 7:30 this morning to pick Gail and Tom up at the train station in Emeryville. It was due in at 8:10 and was on time, much to our surprise, as Amtrak has a reputation for being late. I was home showering, and doing a little vacuuming, just on this one floor. </p>
<p>The flowers Susan had planted are now in full bloom, and they make the front of the house look so much brighter! </p>
<p>There is a huge stack of weeds, sticks, and random garden debris in the back yard from all the clean up yesterday, so I pointed out to Gail what was ahead of us before next Wednesday night. Gail brought new gardening gloves with her for both of us, all set for this outdoor work she had promised to help me with. Lucky me! (I must say it doesn't look very large in the photo, but believe me, it is, and I'm sure we are going to need two weeks to get rid of it in the large compost bins the city provides for us. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom were happy to be here, but both looked so tired. They hadn't slept well in what Tom described as their sardine-tin "bedroom". Gail unpacked right away, and then the two of us went off to Rainbow and Safeway for groceries, as I had no sourdough bread in the house for our breakfast tomorrow. I had delayed getting groceries, and must say it was more fun grocery shopping with Gail for company. Usually Doug picks up any groceries we need on his way home from his T'ai Chi class. </p>
<p>Doug and Tom had just finished up their lunch when we walked in, and Gail and I were more than ready for ours! We had a yummy thick sandwich with all the fixings, and finished off with big cups of hot tea and two games of cards. We chatted the afternoon away, and the time flew by. </p>
<p>Soon it was time for Doug to leave for his class; he came home just as his corn on the cob was ready, and had a veggie burger as Tom had. Gail and I had big spinach salads as neither of us was hungry after our big lunch. That was a quick and easy dinner! </p>
<p>Tom read in the living room for a long time, Doug was busy setting up a second monitor, Gail read a bit after our after-dinner tea and card games, and I got some photo work done on the computer. Tom headed for bed at 9, while Gail somehow managed to stay up for another half hour or so, before going to bed to read. Doug went up ahead of me, as I was doing a little family tree work. Lazy, relaxed day all 'round! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/happy_65th_birthday_doug.html">Happy 65th Birthday, Doug!</a></h2>
								<p>Susan, Kevin, and the children called early and sang a boisterous "Happy Birthday" to Doug. I was making his all time favourite cake ... a cheesecake. The original plan for today had been in place for at least three weeks; two musical acts he was interested in seeing were playing today at the Marin County Fair, and we knew Tom would be interested as well. We left a little later than we planned to, after a very relaxed lazy morning at home, which included lunch too. Bad timing, as it turned out there was a huge traffic jam on the long road that leads to the Golden Gate bridge, and Doug was sure we would not make it in time to see the first act. So new plans were hastily made. </p>
<p>Since we were not too far from another outing we had planned for some time to see, we drove to the Presidio to see the Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy's latest piece of art in San Francisco. It is called "The Spire" and is a beautiful wooden structure made up of many trees that had been cut down for reforestation at the old Army base. It is magnificent, ninety feet tall, and the idea is that one day it will be surrounded by all the new growth of trees now being planted. After admiring it from every angle, we went to an exhibit featuring his other works; his books were on display, and we watched excerpts from the wonderful film made about him several years ago called "Rivers and Tides", plus some new footage on the installation of The Spire. Gail and Tom hadn't heard of him, and were duly impressed. We have plans to take them to see his other two art works in the area, one at the DeYoung Museum, and the other at Stanford University. </p>
<p>Tom was curious about the beautiful dome he could see as we left that area, and so we drove to the Academy of Fine Arts, built for the World's Fair held here in the early 1900s I believe. The dome isn't a cover for a building but is part of what appears to be Roman ruins. I have never walked in and around there myself and so it was very interesting for all of us. It's beautiful, with lovely statuary, high arches, beautiful carvings, a big pond with swans swimming, and a gorgeous view of the Bay. The sun was out and it was a perfect day to see this. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom suggested we go out for dinner at a restaurant of Doug's choice, an extra gift for his 65th birthday, and so he chose one I predicted he would ... Basil Thai. We stopped in at the house long enough for a phone call from Kelly, before heading out for dinner at 6 P.M.</p>
<p>We shared two appetizers ... Gail and I tofu with peanut sauce on skewers, grilled to perfection, and Doug and Tom shared grilled scallops on skewers. Gail and I also shared two dishes, both so tasty ... one an eggplant and tofu dish, and the other a tofu and mushroom dish;  Doug and Tom both had the Pad Thai with prawns, and they ate every bite of theirs as well. What a lovely treat this was! </p>
<p>Doug had lots of messages in today, wishing him a happy birthday, and it was lovely to hear his computer "ring", as we knew it was going to be Bryn and the children calling. Sure enough, in a minute we saw those two little faces on the computer screen, singing "Happy Birthday" with their dad. Mirei likes to dominate the screen, and tried amusing us by pulling her face in as many silly ways that she could think of. She and Riku both laughed when Doug rolled his eyes and got just as silly. Bryn literally had to carry Mirei away from the computer so her brother could have a couple of minutes to say hello to everyone. </p>
<p>We were all too full for cheesecake, so Gail and I played cards and had our tea, Doug and Tom kept themselves busy, and about 8 o'clock we settled in at the kitchen table for a wee party. Gail and Tom gave him three humourous Canadian books (short stories) and a music CD, also Canadian. Susan and Kevin gave him maple caramels and two books as well, along with tickets for two to see their authors ... Wally Shaw in one case, and Nick Hornby in the other. Both will be "in conversation" in San Francisco in October. Bryn and Akane gave him a Japanese furoshiki: a square of heavy cloth that he has mention of on his <a href="http://www.onebag.com/"><u>OneBag</u></a> site. He had admired it less than two weeks ago, and I had sent a message suggesting it would be a perfect birthday gift. It's from a famous store in Kyoto too, which makes it even more special. Kelly and Gregg gave him a movie card for the Landmark Cinema, always a perfect gift for him. And I gifted three certificates for restaurants in Nanaimo, for our upcoming visit there.</p>
<p>It wasn't the birthday that we had planned, but the day was slow and relaxing, and was celebrated on the right day too! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/a_very_productive_day_4th_of_j.html">A Very Productive Day ‚Äî 4th of July at Home</a></h2>
								<p>We had all sorts of ideas about what to do with our day today: go to the Marin County Fair, as there were two acts that would be interesting to see, or perhaps walk around the reservoir if the sun poked through the early morning fog. When we decided against the first, it made sense for Doug and Tom to go to a movie they both want to see, but by the time the decision was made, it was just a little bit too late for that. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gail and I decided that whatever we did, it wouldn't happen this morning, so we got right to work at the biggest household job on my invisible list: clearing off the four deep multi-level shelves that make up my "linen closet" in the hallway upstairs. I knew it was going to be a huge job, and have been putting it off for far too long, waiting to have some help here to tackle it with me. It took the two of us two full hours, and now I wish I had taken a "before" and "after" photo! It looks amazing and we cleared out three massive trash bags filled  with duvets, top sheets, pillow cases, and blankets. Some were well worn, some rarely used for various reasons, and some I just plain did not like. Doug and Tom took them off to the Sally Ann and the man at the reception was very very grateful to have them! </p>
<p>It had been decided that Doug and Tom would stop for Vietnamese sandwiches on the way home, as neither Gail nor Tom have tried them before. We had also managed to get a basket of toys sorted out, with some to give away and some to toss, and I finished cleaning up the toy stove I had started working on the other day. So, we were more than ready for lunch, and were very happy that Doug had talked us out of sharing the sandwiches ... marinated tofu in a very crusty tasty roll, on a bed of grated carrot, cilantro, a special dressing, and some jalepe√±o peppers for a taste surprise!  All of us but Tom took the latter off, as they are bloody hot, but we all like the little zing that they leave behind on the sandwich.Oh, the sandwiches are a bargain at $3.00 each! </p>
<p>Gail and I did manage to sneak in a few games of cards here and there: after breakfast, after we finished up each job, and of course a few other times during the day too. Sometimes we made a pot of tea and then had to have two or three games while we sipped away. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug went off to Amoeba records, followed by a peek at Kezar Stadium, both on Tom's to-do list. On the way home, they stopped in at Mitchell's Creamery for a big container of macapuno (young coconut) ice cream, a favourite of us all. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gail and I had decided to take an afternoon break, and watch a wonderful documentary Doug and I had watched the night before they arrived. I watched a bit of the beginning again while sitting on the bed, but also did some clearing/cleaning in my room while enjoying it for a second time. This worked well, since I effortlessly got through my two bedside drawers, and a three-shelf unit holding sweaters, albums, and jewelry. </p>
<p>Before we knew it, it was dinner time! I am sorry we didn't get out for a long walk, as the day was warm and sunny and it would have been perfect. However, we are planning on being out most of tomorrow, and Gail suggested we just get something big accomplished today. Since the time went by so quickly it was just great to see how much we did. </p>
<p>Susan had dropped in with a bag of perishables this morning, on their way to Yosemite for the week, so Tom had some of her delicious homemade beef and noodle stew, Gail, Doug, and I had French onion soup, and we all had a big spinach salad, with cheesecake later on for dessert. While we were waiting for the dinners to heat, Gail and I prepared a huge fresh fruit salad, using a combination of fruits from our fridge and Susan's. It looked so good when we finished I couldn't resist snapping a photo of it! </p>
<p>Quiet evening ... Gail and I went up after dinner and watched some interviews done at the very end of the movie we had watched earlier ("Watermarks"), a documentary that focused on a group of female swimming champions from Vienna, filmed sixty-five years after fleeing Austria to evade the Nazis. The women were all so amazing ... strong, vibrant, healthy, opinionated, talented, and almost all with a great sense of humour, but always slightly coloured by what that time had done to them and to their families. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom read, Doug was working on the computer, and I caught up on some emails. All this evening fireworks have been blazing across the sky, accompanied by loud booms reverberating over the hills. Happy 4th! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/xxx_vacaville_and_two_islands.html">Vacaville ... and Two Islands Too!</a></h2>
								<p>Gail and Tom always enjoy a trip to Vacaville when they are in town visiting, and we are happy for the excuse to go too, as we never go on our own anymore. It was quite cool when we left, with a heavy fog hanging over the city, but of course the sun was shining and it was very warm with a nice breeze fifty minutes away from the city. No doubt it warmed up there too, but Gail and I both snuggled up in our jackets until we arrived.  </p>
<p>Gail was looking for slacks and I wanted to buy some cards. I ended up with a bright orange blouse as well as the cards, Tom bought lots of goodies at Harry and David's, Doug stocked up on Jelly Bellys and salsa, and we all bought something at the Jockey Outlet store. I had hoped to do some early birthday shopping for Kelly, but had no luck at all. </p>
<p>We stopped for lunch at Fresh Choice, another favourite of Gail's and Tom's, and our usual lunch spot when we are in Vacaville. I heaped up my plate with salad, as I always do, barely having enough room for the small baked potato with all the fixings I enjoy so much. Gail, Tom, and Doug all saved themselves for caramel sauce with a token amount of soft ice cream, and Tom topped his off with some sundae fixings. We all enjoyed the tiny delicious muffins too: corn meal for Tom, Gail, and me, and blueberry for Doug.  </p>
<p>Gail managed to find her slacks and was a happy girl with all her purchases, and I was very happy to find a long lovely lightweight white and blue scarf to snug on over a sweater on our cool summer mornings. </p>
<p>We left about 3:30 P.M. and lucked out with traffic on the way home. We made such good time that we decided to take a drive through Treasure Island, and Yerba Buena Island, two places halfway across the Bay Bridge that in over the twenty years that we have lived here, we have never visited. It was interesting, if still somewhat mysterious. Yerba Buena is essentially one big hill, so visiting it essentially means driving around its base, and seeing very little other than treed hillside (the Coast Guard uses this as a base, but that part of it is closed to the public). Treasure Island, which is entirely reclaimed land (thus flat as a pancake), a former naval base, and the original home of the <a href="http://www.sfmuseum.org/photos2/clipper.html"><u>Pan Am Clippers</u></a>, is now a somewhat mysterious place. Aside from things like a water treatment plant, and many large building of unspecified purpose (although the movie industry is known to use several of them), it's pretty empty except for the western end, where the old barracks buildings have been maintained in very nice shape, and seem to be be filled with people (although we mostly saw their cars, largely pretty upscale models). The island also affords some great views of the Bay Bridge and the city, though it was pretty windy for picture taking. I thought Doug was going to blow away from his perch on the rock while doing so! </p>
<p>Quiet evening at home. No one was hungry after our big lunch, so Gail and I had a fruit bowl, Tom had sourdough toast, and Doug had both. Tom and Doug went up to watch a music video so Gail and I had some time for our family tree, one on each computer. That's it! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/xxx_a_walk_around_stow_lake_to.html">Stopping to Smell the Roses and a Walk Around Stow Lake</a></h2>
								<p>It was a little cool and foggy this morning, a good time to stay in and get some chores done until the sun broke through. Doug had lots of computer work to do, and was printing up books this morning, Tom enjoyed sitting in the living room reading with a coffee cup by his side, and after Gail and I had our usual breakfast of a fried egg, sourdough toast, "bacon", and lots of tea, we had a couple of games of cards before getting on with our day too. </p>
<p>We pulled out the two rolling drawers from the front bedroom, and spent about an hour and a half tidying those up. One contains gift wrap, ribbons, bows, boxes, and gift bags and over time they get muddled together. The other is where I store my Creative Memories scrapbooking tools ... scissors, cropping tools, adhesives, etc., as well as some family heritage folders. </p>
<p>I left Gail to finish off the last of the second set, and made a light and tasty homemade Italian soup for lunch. Gail rolled the two sets of very well organized drawers back in the closet, all done and another job crossed off the list! </p>
<p>We had planned to go for a walk around a reservoir just south of the city, but we had no luck in figuring out just how to get there. So, we decided to do another walk on our list, to Stow Lake with a stop at the DeYoung Museum to show Gail and Tom Andy Goldsworthy's "Fault Line," and check out the view of the city from the observation deck at the top of the museum. </p>
<p>After the wonderful view on this very clear day, and before driving to Stow Lake, we stopped in at the wonderful rose garden to smell the roses. When Amelia was just a baby I used to walk her all through this area for her nap, with a stop both coming and going from her house to slowly drift through and take in the scent of hundreds of roses, all sizes and colours. I couldn't resist taking a few photos of some of the really spectacular and well-kept roses, but won't include them all in this blog entry. :) Gail and I decided we really must get back and wander about the entire garden, and perhaps have lunch on the deck outside the museum. </p>
<p>The one mile walk around Stow Lake was Tom's first and he enjoyed it as much as we thought he would. All of the grandchildren have spent time here too, with boat rides around the tiny island in the middle and the slow stroll around the lake. It was as lovely as always, and we had a perfect day for it too. </p>
<p>We didn't see the usual line up of turtles on the logs, but today got to see over twenty of them swimming freely amongst the ducks, and trying to nibble at an apple core. Just around the corner was a heron, successfully catching tiny fish, and we were lucky enough to stand quite close while Doug snapped photos of him/her. </p>
<p>We got home in lots of time before Doug left for his T'ai Chi class, and Gail and I got right to work on our family trees ... me on Doug's computer and Gail on mine. It is so fast to do this sitting just around a corner from each other, as we can scoot our chairs around to see any problems that come up! </p>
<p>Tom and Doug watched a music video upstairs after dinner, and Gail and I had more "tree" time, plus the usual game or two of cards before bedtime. I sure do enjoy having company in my home!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/family_tree_time_chores_and_mo.html">Family Tree Time, Chores, and More Family Tree Time</a></h2>
								<p>Tom and Doug headed off together early this morning for a 10 o'clock movie about John Dillinger. Gail and I had already eaten, had our tea and cards, and tidied the kitchen, so the minute they were out the door we were at the computer for a couple of solid hours' work on our family trees. We both enjoy this so much and are getting lots of new relatives in with documented historical facts for so many of them. The time flew by! </p>
<p>Before we knew it, the boys were back with their lunch,  shrimp "PoBoy" sandwiches from a bar a few blocks from us. Doug had read a piece in the paper a month or so ago about "great sandwiches in San Francisco", and Jack's Bar was on the list for these particular sandwiches. The shrimp PoBoys appealed to both Doug and Tom, and they came home with huge bundled packages for their lunch. They hadn't realized they would be so big, so each ate only half of these breaded and deep fried shrimp, tucked into a tasty crusty white roll, with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and mayo tucked in. </p>
<p>Gail and I joined them at the table, eating our bowls of fresh fruit with yogurt; we had our carbs this morning! However, we thought we might like to try one of the veggie PoBoys tomorrow. </p>
<p>I had told Gail about a wonderful British movie from many years ago, and Doug had put it at the top of our Netflix list on Friday. So, off we went upstairs with big bowls of popcorn, followed by big cups of tea, to settle in and watch Mike Leigh's "Secrets and Lies". I enjoyed it every bit as much today as I did over ten years ago, and Gail just loved it. I was so pleased, as I had watched it  with Mom and Auntie Rita, who both enjoyed it so much, as did Doug when we first saw it together. Gail had a few tears, but good ones.</p>
<p>After the movie, we got right to work on clearing/cleaning and sorting out the laundry room. I had some shelf paper that wasn't quite long enough for the shelf above the washer and dryer, but Gail finagled it to fit; it looks so much better than the bare wood.  I went through all the toys stored in that room, tossed some of them, and reorganized all the rest of them. No shortage of children's toys in this house! Gail swept up over the tall ceiling and down the walls, and we thoroughly vacuumed it after removing everything from the room. We got it almost all finished just before Doug walked in from his class. </p>
<p>I did try to talk Gail into a walk a few times today, but she insisted it be an at-home day, and so it was. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug finished off their Po'Boys for dinner, Gail and I had fruit bowls with vanilla yogurt, sunflower seeds and crushed flax seeds (with a mixed nut meal for me as well ... yum!) and when the men decided to watch another music video, Gail and I settled in for more family tree work. Gail had brought several pages of a new family for me, so she read it off while I typed it in.  A wonderful way to end our evening, with lots accomplished today. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/gardening_day_and_poboys_for_t.html">Gardening Day and PoBoys for the Girls!</a></h2>
								<p>Tonight is the night for putting out the composting bin, which meant that Gail and I spent about an hour and a half in the garden this morning, filling it up with all the debris that Susan, Kevin, the children, and I collected up last week in our marathon gardening days. Doug did his usual  jumping up and down in the bin, which meant we actually got a huge amount of the leaves, pine needles, and branches in the container. I was sure it was going to take three weeks to get rid of it all! We couldn't get it all in though, and so I called our next door neighbours to see if we could use whatever room they had left in their half size container. Lo and behold, we managed to get the entire brick covered area free of all the debris! </p>
<p>Doug trimmed some dead branches from a tree overhanging the area, clipped the bigger branches for me while I swept up, and then took down a wooden wall that was put up a few years ago to keep out the downstairs neighbour's dog. I have always hated the look of it, and it was time to get rid of it. It needs more attention tomorrow, after Gail and I get rid of a lot of overgrown ivy in the area, I am hoping the last of that small ugly structure can come down. </p>
<p>I finished off the last of the tidying up and sorting in the laundry room, while Gail got out the hose with a new nozzle on it, and did a grand job of cleaning the big windows over and at the back of the kitchen eating area. It looks just wonderful! </p>
<p>Tom and Doug left for Berkeley just past noon. They have plans to be out all day and evening, with lunch at Barney's, book and record stores, dinner out, and finishing off at the "Freight and Salvage" for a concert tonight.</p>
<p>Gail and I left right after they did for a walk to drop magazines off at the hospital, and then 'round the block to pick up our shared PoBoy sandwich, a vegetarian Philly Melt. While we were waiting for our order, Gail spotted some fries being delivered to a table, and thought we should have some too. She was treating to lunch, and had only $2 left on her, but the friendly gal said we could get a half order for that and not to worry about the tax. Gail found 16 cents and I took that up to her, and out of the goodness of her heart this gal delivered a piping hot plate of fries to us, surely a full order! </p>
<p>We shared our sandwich when we arrived home, made tea, and of course played cards before working on our family trees again. We just cannot believe how quickly time passes when we're involved with this project, as it was almost four o'clock before we stopped to have some cherries for a snack. </p>
<p>French onion soup and a big spinach salad for an early dinner, after which I chose photos for my blogs, and we both answered some emails. Gail worked on her tree a little longer, we had an extra game of cards ... and then it was bedtime, both tired after a busy day and lots of exercise and fresh air. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/reiki_and_the_san_francisco_zo.html">Reiki and The San Francisco Zoo</a></h2>
								<p>One of the new doulas at SFGH attended our meeting last month, and invited any of us to call her for a free treatment, as she was going into the business full time, and wanted to work on some people other than her friends. Surprisingly to me, I was the only one who took her up on her offer, and today was the day! She arrived at 10 o'clock with her brand new folding table, and we set it up in our bedroom upstairs, removing the phone first. Quiet music was playing in the background ... soothing ringing tones from a Tibetan singing bowl, a small eye pad over my eyes, and had a "bed buddy" on my tummy for the first half hour. Ahhhhhh!  An hour and twenty minutes later we emerged, with me feeling very relaxed and cozy. I would be very happy to have this kind of treatment again, as it was my first one, but with luck, not my last. My chakras are happy! </p>
<p>Gail was busy in the garden, pulling up some very tough and aggressive ivy.from the side of the garden fence. I went out and worked with her for a bit, and then went in to make lunch for Gail and me, and Doug made up his own specialty for him and Tom ... a tuna Thai dish with brown rice. </p>
<p>And then it was off to the zoo! Neither Tom nor Gail had been to our zoo before, and we had a great day for it. It's often too cool over in that part of the city, but today we had sun and warmer temps, although Gail and I both bundle up more than others. Interesting doing the zoo with adults as we covered the entire zoo, seeing all but two small exhibits, in just three hours. We saw the baby gorilla in a little nest before the mother came to carry her away for a "walk", admired the giraffes, checked out the lions and the bears, visited the insect house, and saw some tiny almost newborn monkeys too. </p>
<p>We made a stop at Rainbow on the way home for some fresh produce, and then it was time for a warm Acme cinnamon sticky bun for all of us, and big cups of hot milky tea for Gail and me, and cards, of course! </p>
<p>Doug went off to his class, Gail and I had some family tree and email time using both computers, and we all ate dinner together after Doug got home at 7:30. Our usual evening followed: Doug and Tom upstairs watching a music video, Gail and I doing a little tree work, then me getting busy with my blog photos while Gail read. About 10 o'clock I started showing Gail some videos of the children, from last October; Tom and Doug joined us at some point and we all watched the singing/building/piano-music videos until 11 P.M.! Bedtime for all after that entertainment. More to come at some point.   </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/murphys_and_angel_camp.html">Murphys and Angels Camp</a></h2>
								<p>We set off at 9:30 this morning, heading almost due east, to Murphys, California, a small town of about 2,000 people. It was in its heyday in the late 1850s and was one of the famous gold mining towns. The population back then was about 3,000, and unlike most mining towns it remained a viable place to live and visit because of the mountain scenery and the nearby caverns. </p>
<p>The temperature was to be 89F today, and even though it was a hot day for sure, it didn't feel that hot to us. Doug and Tom found it hotter seated in the front seat, but Gail and I were perfectly comfortable. The first part of our trip was on the highway but the last half was on a smaller two lane road, and we enjoyed the country scenery all the way to Murphys. </p>
<p>It was time for lunch when we arrived, and we walked from one end to the other to check out our choices, settling on a small bakery/sandwich shop. The food was delicious; Doug and I had tuna on cornmeal bread, Gail had a veggie sandwich on cornmeal, and Tom had a turkey sandwich on focaccia. For a dollar extra it came with a small portion of tasty potato salad, two strawberries, and a few thick potato chips ... an overabundance of potatoes, for sure! </p>
<p>However, over the next two hours we walked it off. First stop was the local pokey, where Doug and Tom posed for us at the door. It really was the local spot for bad guys at one point, so was very interesting for sure. We took lots of photos of the lovely old stone and frame buildings, built in the 1860s onward. The local church was built the same year as the saloon, and Murphys Hotel had many interesting visitors in those days: Ulysses S. Grant, Mark Twain (aka Samuel Clemens), Bret Harte (an author), Thomas Lipton (of Lipton tea), J.P. Morgan, and John Jacob Astor of the Astor family. There was a plumbing store featuring antique parts for bathrooms, kitchens, and the home in general, and Doug found three old keys from Britain that he always keeps an eye out for. He was very pleased with his purchase. </p>
<p>Toronto had moose, painted up and placed around the city, Nanaimo had painted whales last year, and Murphys has frogs with gold pans (because of Mark Twain's famous story, "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County"). I couldn't resist taking a photo of one of them. </p>
<p>We stopped in at a candy store before leaving, and everyone bought a treat... Gail and I got a bag each of wonderfully tasty coconut brittle, Doug bought peanut brittle and caramel, and Tom bought chocolate with chili oil. </p>
<p>Angels Camp, less than half an hour away, was our next stop, another gold mining town that survived after the miners had left. Angels Camp is 50% larger than Murphys, so we found it odd that a huge percentage of its stores were closed at 4 o'clock on a Friday afternoon. Gail and I were more than ready for our tea, and we found the perfect spot, a large airy non-profit business, with lots of food and beverage choices. The woman who served us was very friendly; the tea came in a lovely little pot that kept the tea very hot, and kept us supplied with lots of hot water and milk. Tom and Doug wandered around the store/cafe looking at all the goods brought in from other countries.  </p>
<p>We decided to stop for dinner on the way home, and ended up at "Mimi's" in Dublin. Gail and I shared a huge portion of fish and chips, perfect for a Friday night, Tom had a pulled pork sandwich on ciabetta, and Doug had barbecued salmon. </p>
<p>Gail and I had our cups of tea at home while playing cards, and then worked on our family tree while Tom and Doug went upstairs to watch a music DVD. That's it! A whole day out of the house today and a new adventure. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/south_bay_and_stone_river.html">Off to the South Bay and Stone River</a></h2>
								<p>Gail and I enjoyed our usual long breakfast with tea and cards, and then got to work ... together sorting out the set of rolling drawers in the laundry room that contain all of my cards, envelopes, note paper, stickers and craft items for the children, and post cards. We did a great job and it is once again organized and tidy. </p>
<p>Soon after Doug returned home from his T'ai Chi class we all headed out to "The Valley", south of San Francisco. Gail is always so happy to do this trip, as she can rely on it being hot and sunny there. This is one of the reasons that Doug and I tend to avoid a trip there, as hot and sunny is not our favourite thing. We were all happy today as the high was only 76F, hot enough for Gail, and not too high for Tom, Doug, and me. </p>
<p>After a leisurely drive through the lovely, spacious, well kept grounds of Stanford University, with all the impressive old buildings, and new students and their parents wandering the well worn pathways, Doug and Tom dropped Gail and me off at the quite lovely outdoor mall very close by the university. They were off for fish burritos at one of Doug's favourite places for lunch in that area, and Gail and I were planning to wander about the shops and see what appealed to us there. </p>
<p>My favourite spot, a huge deluxe grocery store with wonderful take out foods, breads, drinks, and desserts has closed, so we decided on tasty baguettes with buffalo mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, and basil from a nearby patisserie. We ate outside with the tallest cups of tea that Starbucks serves, and enjoyed every bit of it: the food, the tea, and the setting. Lots of flowers at this mall, and some interesting shops. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug met us two hours later and we had our photo taken under the most wonderful-smelling huge flower display. </p>
<p>It was just a short drive from there to our third Andy Goldsworthy structure, one of my favourites so far, called "Stone River". We had been there twice before, once with Akane, Bryn, and Riku, and it's as impressive each and every time. Gail and Tom enjoyed it too, strolling along admiring the carefully placed stones. We took lots of photos, of course. </p>
<p>We took a few minutes to wander through the Rodin sculpture garden next to the nearby art gallery, and were amazed when it started to rain! We don't really expect rain here until late October or November, so the drops falling from the sky came as quite a surprise. It didn't last long, of course ...; too bad as everything could use a little freshening up in the area. </p>
<p>Doug and I used to drive to the valley often, and one of the things we liked to do on our way home was stop at Webb Ranch, long known for its tasty and reasonably priced organic produce. The ranch is on Stanford University grounds, which I had not known, and the produce was every bit as good as I remembered it. Gail and Tom bought lots of delicious fresh fruit and vegetables ‚Äî peas in the pod, avocados, plums, a huge melon ‚Äî and we bought corn, tomatoes, and other veggies too. Summer time and the eating is easy! </p>
<p>We drove home along 280, enjoying the views of the fields and cows, and not too much traffic either. After putting away all the produce, we had a quick dinner of a stuffed "chicken" filet with cranberries and goat cheese (Gail and me), veggie "buffalo wings" for Doug and Tom, and corn on the cob for all. It was a little early for it so the cobs weren't very big but the flavour was divine. </p>
<p>Amazingly it started to rain quite heavily, and the party the neighbours were having moved inside. Gail and I played cards, Doug and Tom went up to watch a music video, and Gail and I had some time on the two computers for the family tree. </p>
<p>Gorgeous sunset after the rain! </p>
<p>I stayed up much too late working through some genealogy "hints"... </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/a_very_busy_day_at_home.html">A Very Busy Day at Home For the Girls</a></h2>
								<p>After a long day out yesterday, Gail and I decided we would stay home and get through some of the chores on our "to do" list. But before we tackled the upstairs work, we took out all the fruits and veggies we bought yesterday, and set to work making a huge fresh fruit salad, Greek salad, and tabbouleh. We worked together, chopping, mincing, pitting, slicing, etc. and two hours flew by. I am so sorry I didn't take a photo of our finished dishes, as they all looked and smelled wonderful! </p>
<p>We had lunch with Tom and Doug, and they set off to visit the Colma Cemetery to find Wyatt Earp's final resting place. He's not related so Gail and I decided to let them go on their own. They had a great time exploring and took a few photos, including the dome-roofed mausoleum housing the remains of Levi Strauss and family; one of the nearby headstones gave them a chuckle, as the cross piece in the "G" had worn away, making the inscription read that the poor woman was sleeping with the fishes! Some thoughtful folks had left some presents for Wyatt, among them stones, coins, and a wee dram of whiskey. </p>
<p>They had some other errands to run too, so we settled in for an hour or so of family tree work again, before going up to tackle the huge number of bags of children's clothes to be sorted. This is a job I have put off for a long long time, as it is overwhelming ... what to give away, what to keep for babies, children, in the future, with my doula moms, what clothes of my grandchildren's to retain for them to have one day for keepsakes, and what to give to charity. So many piles, so many memories, so many decisions to make ... it's tough for me. </p>
<p>However, Gail got at my backlog of ironing, we put on some taped Oprahs, and while I sorted and made those decisions, with Gail urging me to get rid of more than I might have without her, we did very well. Gail finds ironing relaxing (not a word I would choose for that particular job) and I was happy to get at this long put-off chore of mine. We did very well, and by the end of three solid hours the ironing was almost done (we did take a short break once or twice, putting our feet up), and I had made significant inroads into the grand giveaway! </p>
<p>Tom and Doug had stopped on their way home to pick up a fresh pineapple for our fruit salad, so we got that prepared and the table set, with time for a quick game of cards before they came back from picking up our pizza from "Little Star", Gail's favourite pizza ever(!) and certainly one of our top three in the area. </p>
<p>We spent our evening in the usual way, although Gail and Tom went to bed earlier tonight, Doug followed not much later, and even though my intention was to go upstairs and read in bed, I didn't turn out my light until 1 A.M. </p>
<p>Oh, I took a photo of all of our wonderful produce purchases at Webb Ranch before we started eating it all. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/xxx.html">Finn, Garden Clean-Up, and a Long Walk Across the Golden Gate Bridge</a></h2>
								<p>Finn rang the doorbell this morning, greeting me with his usual big smile! Susan and I stood chatting at the front door for a few minutes before she left to run errands, and Finn was very surprised to see new faces upstairs at our house! The minute he spotted Gail in the garden he covered his face with his hands, I guess assuming that if he couldn't see her, he too was invisible. She just talked quietly to him, and after becoming invisible just one more time, he got interested in the gardening she was doing. Gail is determined to get the rest of the garden, started so well by Susan and family, finished off before she leaves, so today she got at it. Doug and Tom had picked up a proper shrub rake yesterday, so she got to give up using the children's garden tools today ... a big improvement! </p>
<p>Doug found a tiny spider in the house just before he went up to shower, and placed it in a small glass for Finn to see. He was very interested, of course, and after inspecting it, watched as Doug set it loose in the garden. </p>
<p>Finn usually spends most of his time outside when he comes over on warm days, but today he was feeling domestic and worked away at cutting vegetables and fruit from the kitchen area with a cutting board and a knife helping him with the job. He was very serious about it, and it was fun snapping photos as he worked away. </p>
<p>After he ate his usual bowl of porridge "yes, with stawberry", around 11 A.M., I decided to get out the container of "diamond sand", a clay-like substance that all the children love playing with. Finn has played with it at the Bay Area Discovery Museum, but never at Nana's house, so he was happy to sit there working away with the dump truck and the little digger, and knocking down the tiny "castles" I built up with a small cup. As always, our time together passed quickly. Susan came in just after the noon hour bearing a box of luscious pastries. Gail had been reading in the living room with Tom, and once we said goodbye to Susan and Finn, she and I shared a yummy cream cheese and fruit pastry, before lunch! </p>
<p>It was a gorgeous sunny day with blue clear skies, so we decided it was the perfect day to walk the Golden Gate Bridge. Right after a quick lunch, we drove, parked, and walked up the steep, but now paved steps from the Fort Point area to the bridge itself. We could not have picked a better day for this, as it wasn't too windy, as it often is, it wasn't too cold, as it often is, and Gail and Tom took lots of photos. This was Tom's first time walking the bridge and we all enjoyed the hour and a half round trip. </p>
<p>We got home with time to spare before Doug went off to his class; we decided to have dinner together when Doug got home, so Gail finished off the last of the ironing, while I did a bit more sorting of the toys to give away. </p>
<p>Gail and I sat and played cards after dinner, pretty tuckered out from a really productive busy day, and the tea tasted especially good tonight. I answered emails, while Gail sat with Tom, reading. Early night for everyone but me ... I'm tired, but have trouble giving up that time at the computer at the end of these long busy days! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/windows_morning_afternoon.html">Windows, a Morning Out, and an Afternoon at Home</a></h2>
								<p>Gail and I were sitting having our tea, and playing cards, when we both commented on how dirty the windows were at the top and back of our eating area. I used to have them washed professionally, but that was too long ago, and so today was the day to get at them ourselves! Doug bought new nozzles for the hose just before we went to PEI, and Gail was more than happy to use the most powerful nozzle to get most of the debris and dirt off the sun roof area of the windows. She did a great job, and then tackled the outside of the French doors and side windows. Gail was not quite tall enough to reach the very top of the inside of the tallest windows, so Doug came and together they got the windows spic and span! </p>
<p>I was admiring them as I tackled smaller jobs that needed doing in the kitchen and dining room. We made great progress this morning, in a very short time period! Having a cleaning crew sure does make a difference! </p>
<p>By 10:30, Gail and I were at my hairdresser's in Noe Valley. Gail was willing to stay home and continue working, but it is such a treat to have someone with me in this city, and it didn't take much to talk her into joining me. I hadn't had my hair cut since the week before I went to Japan in early April, the longest I've gone without a cut in a long time. Three days ago it looked just great, and the next day it was driving me crazy! </p>
<p>Bing, the gal who cuts my hair, also "does" brows, and since both Gail and I were overdue for some brow shaping, we decided to get this done while we were there. Neatly trimmed, we stopped in at my favourite Thai restaurant in Noe Valley for a take-away lunch of "crispy tofu" with peanut sauce, and a shared dish of sauteed tofu with mixed vegetables. It has been about three years since I have been there &mdash; far too long! &mdash; and it was lovely to reconnect with the owner who recognized me from all the years before that I have eaten there. We both stated that the other looked just great, and agreed that life was good for both of us. When Doug was travelling so much, I often stopped in for take-away for my dinner, and Kelly more than once treated me to that wonderful food when she was in town with the children. Lots of good memories of good food and service. </p>
<p>Doug and Tom were just preparing their lunches when we got home, in anticipation of a movie this afternoon, receiving great reviews, called "The Hurt Locker" about a bomb unit in Iraq. </p>
<p>After enjoying our tasty lunch, along with the inevitable tea and card game, Gail and I continued cleaning the debris from the back garden. I have been asking neighbours if we could fill up their composting containers, and so we were determined to bag up as much as we possibly could before having it out on the curb tomorrow night. It is all looking soooo good! Doug kept stepping into the bin for us, and more and more needles got packed in. We have been breaking up or cutting the longer pieces of dried wood to make even more room, and it's amazing how much we finally managed to gather up. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug ran some errands for us, dropping off clothes to both the Salvation Army and to the Homeless Prenatal Shelter, and stopped in for a few Bob's doughnuts, on Tom's "to-do" list. Not long after arriving home, back out they went to pick up a pizza from "Tomasso's" pizzeria in North Beach. This was also on Gail and Tom's to-do list, but since we are running out of time, and getting so much done in the house, we decided take-out from there tonight would be just fine. We also had corn on the cob, as Doug had picked some up on his grocery run last night. Dessert was divine: coconut macaroons from Bob's, a treat from our husbands for us, and which we topped with coconut ice cream. Was that good! </p>
<p>Gail and Tom sat in the living room reading after Tom and Doug had watched another music video, and I answered some emails. I had just found out this morning that Bryn and Riku would be arriving in San Francisco on my birthday (!), and so it was time to book Caillie's flight here, and my flight to Toronto with her, and then back for October. </p>
<p>I had a little trouble deciding just exactly how long to stay in Ontario!  I wanted as much time with Uncle Frank as I could manage, so Doug had come close to booking three different flights for me, as I changed my mind for various reasons. I'm sure it was frustrating for him! </p>
<p>Just as the final decision had been made, and a click away from booking it for the 3rd of October, Bryn popped up on IM. Thank goodness it wasn't a minute later, as he reminded me that Mirei was going to be arriving with him October the 1st! How I had let this slip my mind is beyond me; I must have been awfully tired when he first told me about this on IM some time ago, but it was "stop the presses!" time for sure. Doug had to start the whole booking business over again, and it was quite late before it all was settled. </p>
<p>I was happy to finally be able to drop a note to Kelly and Caillie with the times for Caillie's trip here. I am so pleased it all worked out so well, as we will have time with Riku on his own at the beginning of his trip, and then time with Caillie on her own, at the end of hers. </p>
<p>Too late once more, I headed off to bed. I might just sleep all the way to B.C. starting on Friday! </p>
<p>p.s. It was such a busy day that I didn't even think to take photos ... so have just this one. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/the_big_push_is_on.html">The Big Push is On!</a></h2>
								<p>Knowing a few days ago that Bryn and Riku were going to be arriving on my birthday, the decision was made to leave for B.C. on Friday morning, rather than on Sunday as originally planned, which means that we are just one day away from leaving. We have accomplished so much in the house, but of course could have used another few days to do all that we hoped to. So today was another day that Gail and I just worked hard all day, trying to get as much done as we could inside the house as well. It's looking great, but today was the day to tackle the framed photos, the paintings, and the framed prints in the upstairs hallway just outside our bedroom door. They have been there longer than I care to admit, not being sure just where to safely store them until the day that there is room on walls to hang them. </p>
<p>First we had to take everything out of a spacious crawl space in behind the wall where our clothes hang. When Gail was here in early December, we had prepared the house for not only Christmas decorating, but for Bryn and family moving in with us for three months, by clearing all our collectibles and chicken collection from all the shelves in five rooms on the main level. Once all that was cleared out and vacuumed today, I realized that this flat dry space would be a perfect temporary home for the mass of frames. It was a huge job, as there are a lot of them, but they all went in easily after I had placed them in untied huge plastic bags.</p>
<p>Gail and I took turns vacuuming and cleaning the wall where they had been leaning for so long, and then I did a final sort of the toys that could be stored in another out-of-the-way area, leaving our room looking more like our bedroom and less like a play area. I imagine it's going to take us a while to get used to how wide and spacious this area looks now. Doug suggested we turn it into a bowling lane!  </p>
<p>While Gail and I were busy inside, Doug and Tom were cutting up long boards that had been part of a barrier between our back garden and our downstair neighbour's access to our garden. It was originally put up to keep their dog out of the garden, but that is no longer necessary and I was anxious to reclaim the area. Now it is longer and roomier, and just looks so much better. This makes it look like it had for many years, and I am so pleased with it all. </p>
<p>Doug and Tom had gone out for lunch today at a spot downtown they both enjoy so much: "neatloaf" sandwiches at Ananda Fuara. Gail and I had our two cold salads for our lunch, taboulleh and Greek salad, with some sourdough toast to soak up the juices. Yum!  Of course we stopped for tea and cards midway though the afternoon. </p>
<p>I actually went to bed early tonight, although it didn't help at all. My mind was whirling with all that the summer holds and into my busy fall as well. </p>
<p>I took only one photo of Gail doing a final sweep in the garden today (with what appears to be a green mustache!), and I so wish I had before and after photos of all that we accomplished together upstairs. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/xxx_on_the_road_san_francisco.html">On the Road ... San Francisco, California,  to Corvallis, Oregon</a></h2>
								<p>I stayed up much too late last night, trying to write as many catch-up emails as possible, and get some e-cards ready to be sent out. It all took so much longer than I hoped it would, and the morning came too early. Of course Gail was already up, and everyone was busy getting all the little last-minute jobs done before leaving the house. We left twenty minutes later than we had planned to, at 9:20 A.M., but nothing was forgotten, including watering all the flowers on the front steps, the last chore I had on my list. </p>
<p>I was happy to sit in the back seat of the car, relaxing with Gail, knowing there wasn't another thing to do but relax, read, doze, enjoy the scenery, and help decide what to eat where, and when! It was cool when we left the city but of course it soon warmed up. We were well supplied with cold water bottles in a small cooler in the back seat with us, which ‚Äî covered with a soft blanket to keep it as cool as possible ‚Äî also gave us a good arm rest. </p>
<p>The time passed quickly; I caught up on a few newspapers, Gail read a novel set in Liverpool she is going to pass on to me, and I dozed on and off more frequently than I had intended to. We hoped to make good time today and rather than get off the main highway for lunch, we opted for a quicker stop at a "Taco Bell", and I must say it hit the spot. Gail and I both had seven layer burritos, and then decided we were hungry enough for a small cheese and bean burrito as well. We had only a banana for breakfast before leaving, so I wasn't surprised we were hungry. Gail bought an icy pineapple coconut drink to share too, which was so cold it gave us both "ice cream headaches"! Tom and Doug had the seven layer burrito as well as another smaller burrito. </p>
<p>Back on the road, I started working on some sudoku puzzles, and actually managed to finish two of them on my own, making that three in total! I'm slowly working away at them, and enjoy the challenge, but I am much better at crossword puzzles! </p>
<p>We stopped for gas, and bathroom breaks, and stopped at the same lovely rest stop where Bryn and Doug slept in a van, many many years ago, on their way to California from West Vancouver. And many years after that we stopped there with a very young Riku, a mere nine months old, so he could nurse, sit in the cool grass, and look at the cool running river at the back of that area. Lots of good memories here, and Gail and Tom have stopped here as well on their various trips to California from Nanaimo. </p>
<p>We lucked out for dinner, as "Maggie", our GPS gal, had led us to a vegetarian restaurant in Eugene, where we had decided would be our dinner stop. It was called "Yum Yum's", and was in a really lovely huge outdoor mall, with lots of upscale restaurants, a group of young people playing in a band on a central entertainment area, and many independent and interesting shops. We all had a hard time deciding what to eat as there were so many great choices. It didn't help that we were hungrier than usual either! </p>
<p>I was so happy with my large organic green salad with bite-sized chunks of grilled tofu, and a really delicious Asian-style dressing. Gail thoroughly enjoyed her veggie burger, Tom had a "bowl" which was really quite small, and probably not as much as he needed after our long break between meals, and Doug thought he had picked the perfect meal for him too: a "wrap" with lots of his favourite things. Happy travellers were we! </p>
<p>We had decided at some point in the afternoon that we would stop for the night in Corvallis, Oregon, and we made such good time that it was easy to do this. Traffic was light and we got to our Motel 6 at about 8 P.M. We should have just checked into our room then, but Gail and I thought a hot cup of tea and a game of cards in the room would be the perfect end to our day, and Tom was looking for a magazine to read. We had no luck finding an open Starbucks for our tea, and went to two different places we were told were open. One of them was in a Safeway store so I bought some delicious Bing cherries for the car trip tomorrow, and of the three places we tried for Tom's magazine, not one had what he wanted. Our very last stop was at a huge empty "Taco Time"  for tea, perhaps the only place open in this area after 7 P.M., and what a riot this was. I asked the young gal at the service counter for the largest cup of tea they had, and was nearly bowled over when she gave me two <strong>massive</strong> plastic cups of really hot tea, so hot I couldn't pick them up. She double cupped them for me, and how my fellow passengers laughed at me when I walked out to the car with them. The photos tell the story. </p>
<p>Doug checked his email in our room, although the connection was not a strong one, and he didn't get very far with it. I had gone into Gail and Tom's room to play cards and drink that tea, determined to finish it after all the trouble Doug had gone to, finding it for us! Tom walked out to two different stores, quite a distance away, still seeking a magazine, but came back empty-handed. </p>
<p>I was so sorry I hadn't taken a photo of our very well packed car, or of us at the rest stop, but it was so hot travelling through northern California and into Oregon that it just never occured to me until it was too late. </p>
<p>Bed time at 11 P.M. for four car-weary travellers. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/post_4.html">Corvallis, Oregon to Nanaimo, B.C.!</a></h2>
								<p>We had decided the night before not to set alarm clocks, but to get on the road by 8 A.M. unless we were ready earlier. The idea was to slip a note under our doors, but the phone rang at 7 o'clock, so we were up and in the shower immediately. Gail and Tom were awake when their phone also rang (I guess the office hadn't turned off their last wake-up calls, or perhaps they merely like to get their guests up and out early!), so at 7:45, Gail tapped on our door. Tom went down and several trips later had filled up the cooler with ice. </p>
<p>Our first stop was breakfast, just a few doors down from the motel. Veggie options were limited, with meat served with all their meals, so Gail and I ordered side orders of an egg each, potatoes, and shared the toast, with lots of hot tea, of course. Doug and Tom had pancakes, not our "cup of tea" at all. </p>
<p>We settled in for the trip to our next stop, with Tom and Doug in the front seat, and Gail and I happily ensconced with our books, and my sudoku puzzles, stopping to chat now and then, and drinking lots of cold water. The time passed quickly, although we were heading for Mt. Vernon for lunch at one of Doug's and my favourite spots, and were more than ready for it by the time we arrived after 1 o'clock. We sat upstairs for the first time, away from the hustle and bustle downstairs, much busier than I expected it to be on a weekday. The food was delicious, as always. </p>
<p>Gail and I finished off our tea, wandered into the new-age-type gift shop, bought a few cards, and waited for Tom and Doug to come back from their trip to the nearby bookstore. Then it was off to Bellingham, for a stop at Trader Joe's for Gail and Tom, where they stocked up on lots of veggie "bacon", "sausage" patties, and other goodies. Gail bought an insulated bag, which did the trick until we arrived home. </p>
<p>We arrived at the border around 5:30, and had almost no wait at all, with just a few cars ahead of us at Douglas Point. We whizzed right through, with nary a question about anything we were bringing through with us. </p>
<p>The timing was just right for catching the 7:30 ferry out of Horseshoe Bay; we were well ahead in the line-up and sat reading and chatting for the half hour before we boarded. Because of our late lunch, no one was very hungry for on-board eating, but I had a small pizza, Tom and Doug had some sweet potato fries, and Gail and I were more than ready for a hot cuppa and cards once we cleared away the dishes. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug sat enjoying the view, Doug read the local paper, and as always the trip passed quickly. I stepped outside to take a few photos and took a good one of Gail as well as the scenery coming into Nanaimo, beautiful as always. From the time we drove into Vancouver, it all just felt like home to me. </p>
<p>We made one stop at the local grocery store, for a few breakfast items and milk for our tea! By  9:15,  we were unpacking the car, opening windows in the house, Doug and I unpacking our bags, and getting settled into our lovely ready-for-us room, this time with an extra high mattress on it. Gail and Tom bought a new one a few months ago and now both beds are really high! </p>
<p>Of course Gail and I checked our emails, and had a few hands of cards before heading off to bed. Nice to be settled in again, after two long days on the road. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/sunday_in_namaimo.html">Lazy Sunday in Namaimo</a></h2>
								<p>Ahhhhh, this was such a relaxing day for all of us. Doug wasn't sitting behind the wheel of the car, Tom wasn't sweating away in the front seat, wishing he could open his window far enough that Gail and I didn't request the windows stay up a bit more, and Gail and I had some room to stretch our legs after two days in that back seat! </p>
<p>Gail and I started off our day with our usual breakfast, thanks to the stop for the veggie "bacon", and of course played a few hands of cards before the day really got started. Eventually she and Tom went off to Costco to stock up the fridge with lots of fresh fruit, veggies, and staples. I caught up on a few emails and blogs, while Doug stretched out on the deck, reading away the hours. </p>
<p>After our late lunch together, Gail and I got busy in the kitchen. All the groceries got put away and thank goodness they have an extra fridge downstairs for all the boxes of cherries, raspberries, blueberries, etc. Once we had some counter space cleared, Gail made up a huge fruit bowl, and I sliced the five or six loaves of sourdough bread for the freezer.</p>
<p>Doug was finishing up a book on the deck, and Tom looked up and taped some of their favourite shows before settling in with his book. </p>
<p>Our intention was to get out for a walk today, but we ended up not doing that, busy with all the other things to do. Gail and I did take some time for some family tree work, though, as well as checking emails, and more blog writing for me. </p>
<p>I couldn't resist taking a photo of Gail's messy bed, still piled with clothes, while ours was as neat as a pin from the time we awoke this morning. Not often that this happens! Gail laughed when I showed her the photos, and soon her room was as tidy as usual.</p>
<p>We had a delicious dinner, prepared by Gail of wonderful tender corn on the cob, and wild salmon, grilled on the barbecue, after marinating in a mango and ginger mixture that Tom had picked up along his travels. Yum! I'm hoping to get in at least one or two more salmon dinners while we're here. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/penny_palapas_and_a_long_walk.html">Penny's Palapa, a Long Walk Home, and Some Disturbing News from the Falls</a></h2>
								<p>I slept in until 7:45 this morning, which seems to have settled in as being my usual wake-up time here. Gail was up and on the computer when I walked in the room, and had been up for an hour and a half. She had our fresh fruit bowls ready to eat on the balcony on this warm and sunny morning,  and I was so lazy I was the last to shower, at 11 o'clock today! I got busy with emails and finished up a couple of blogs before finally getting ready to go out. </p>
<p>I had given Doug three gift certificates for his birthday this year, all for meals at some of our favourite places to eat in Nanaimo. We had decided today was the perfect day for brunch, as the weather is warm and dry enough for outdoor eating, and it's a weekday so we assumed it wouldn't be too busy at "Penny's Palapa" on the waterfront. We were surprised to find only one table for four available when we arrived just before noon, but the service was good and we didn't have to wait too long for our brunch. Gail and Doug always have the huevos rancheros; Tom had his usual too, a breakfast burrito; and I had a vegetarian plate with a new addition this year: a strip of marinated and grilled tofu. All the meals were as tasty as always! </p>
<p>We walked up into the main business section of Nanaimo, where Doug and I stopped in to ask a few questions about our retirement funds in the local bank. It was lovely and cool in there (and so hot outside by this time!), and we didn't mind at all that we had to wait a bit before we were seen. However, despite the heat, Gail and I decided to walk home along the seawall, and rushed a bit, as we had the key for the house, and didn't want Tom and Doug sitting waiting for us after they poked into a few bookstores. We enjoyed our walk; it was as lovely as always  walking along, enjoying the water views, complete with seaplanes buzzing into and out of the harbour.</p>
<p>We were home for an hour, had our tea and cards, and were checking emails when Tom and Doug walked in. The rest of the afternoon and early evening passed quickly. Doug is whipping through a book or more a day, enjoying his leisure time in the living room or on the deck, Tom is reading and watching TV, and Gail keeps busy with a few household chores, as well as helping me get more names into the family tree from her sources, and planning and making lunches and dinners. She and I were not very hungry after our big brunches, but I had a small plate of the wonderful Greek and tabbouleh salads she had made up earlier, complete with fresh mint from her container garden on the deck. Tom and Doug each had a simple but tasty meal of tofu dogs and beans.  </p>
<p>Gail and I were playing cards at 7 o'clock when the phone rang. We had been hoping to hear from Candy at some point this evening, as she and Rick had driven to the Falls today to spend a week with Beth and Paul. However, as soon as Gail heard her voice she knew something was wrong, and it was. When Candy and Rick pulled up to the house, instead of Paul and Beth waiting on the porch for them, it was Wendy and Paul. Beth had chest pains this morning and has asked Carol to take her to the hospital. Beth must have been very frightened for her to suggest such a thing, and so now she is in Cardiac ICU, hooked up to various tubes, and waiting to hear whether or not she suffered a mild heart attack, had an angina attack, or whether there was something else going on. Now we have to wait until tomorrow to see how our baby sister is. </p>
<p>We were all tired from the heat and anxious about Beth, so we went to fairly bed early, even me(!) ... in bed at 11 P.M. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/worrisome_news_good_news_and_b.html">Worrisome News, Good News ... and Birthday Treats, Too</a></h2>
								<p>I  woke at 7:45 today, walked into the computer room to hear from Gail that Riku is in the hospital in Japan. He awoke with a high fever, went to the doctor's, and was sent to the hospital to be admitted. Bryn filled me in not much later via IM. Riku had been in for ten hours at this point, with an infection of unknown origin. He has had blood work done, and been hooked up to IV, with antibiotics being given three times a day. The doctor has told them he could be in for as long as a week, although the night nurse told Akane that she thinks he won't be in that long. He and Bryn are scheduled to leave for San Francisco in eight days, and I just want him to be well and healthy when he is on that plane. Now we wait for more news on the situation, as I am writing this fourteen hours later. </p>
<p>Bryn did pass on some happy news about Mirei. She "loved, loved, loved" her short term at the Japanese nursery school she went to for a few weeks after her French Immersion program ended for the summer, and Akane said her Japanese language skills are just astounding as a result. Today she conquered the letter C which surprised me to hear had been a little puzzling for her, as she was printing R, E, and M when I was in Japan in April. She and Bryn made a get well card for Riku, and I imagine they are at the hospital now with him. How I wish I were too! </p>
<p>And we were worried about Beth too, as she was in the hospital overnight. And just as she hoped, she was released today, although Candy wrote to say she checked herself out without waiting to see her doctor. We checked emails throughout the day for any more news on Beth or Riku, but heard nothing more. Beth was waiting to hear from the sleep disorder clinic, though, as she has sleep apnea and has done nothing about it for far too long. Candy will get tough with her about this for sure! </p>
<p>Gail was treating me to a "tips and toes" manicure and pedicure, side by side, at her favourite salon. We puttered about in the house in the morning, and at 11:30 Tom and Doug dropped us off at Rutherford Mall for lunch. They were going out for lunch and to a bookstore together, while Gail and I went to "Kelsey's" where we were the first customers of the day; we shared a veggie burger, with a bowl of broccoli and cheese soup each to start. It was an hour or so before our 1:30 appointment, so we went looking for a white blouse for Gail, found one at last, and wandered into a huge antique store. If I had the money, and the room(!), I would have been tempted to buy a sweet wooden and wicker doll's rocking chair. </p>
<p>Our treatments lasted for almost two hours of solid pampering. It was wonderful, just having my fingernail's trimmed, the hands lightly scrubbed with a rough lotion, lots of cream, a very light pink polish ... something I never wear on my fingers but didn't resist this time, and then a hand and leg massage, ending with polish on my toes too. We had herbal tea, and I had a cozy blanket on too, as I was a little chilly in the air conditioned room. I came close to dozing off a couple of times, but Riku's little face kept coming to me. I wondered if he cried when the needles went in for the tests and the IV, and how he was sleeping. </p>
<p>It's a hot day, but the house stayed fairly cool with all the fans running and the doors and windows open to catch any breeze. We had a game of cards, had our afternoon tea, checked for emails again (nothing from anyone yet), and left for a birthday dinner treat for Doug from me ... a fish and chips restaurant that was new to both of us. It was just great! It is called the "Fox and Hounds", a British-style pub, that was voted as having the best fish and chips on Vancouver Island. We are sure they are, as the fish (cod, which I am not usually fond of at all) was delicious with not too heavy a batter, the chips and green salad perfect, as were the three desserts we ordered. Gail and I shared a wonderful rice pudding, Doug had bread pudding with hot custard sauce, and Tom a banana and pecan pudding with sauce. While we were waiting for our meals we all sipped at our tall glasses of Harp (Tom), Kinkelly (Gail), Coke (Doug), and a very tasty hard cider for me. </p>
<p>Home to a very hot house about 7:30.  Gail had promised both Tom and Doug that she would make them a cheesecake to have here, so I got busy with that, while Gail searched for my recipe for it. No luck, so we winged it, and I'm sure it will be fine. I made up some tuna for sandwiches tomorrow, Gail washed up the baking dishes, and we finally sat out on the deck where it is definitely cooler than the 86F than in the house! We even played cards out on the table, and didn't have our evening tea. It's just bloody hot here right now and apparently is going to continue for a few days. </p>
<p>Still hoping to hear from Bryn before heading for bed ... </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/good_news_and_such_a_lovely_da.html">Good News! ... Little Qualicum Falls, and Goats on the Roof!</a></h2>
								<p>I knew I wouldn't have an easy time sleeping last night until I had some word on how Riku was doing. I should have emailed Bryn last night instead of sending questioning messages via IM, as he can't access them once he has logged off his computer. I knew that, but somehow in my worried state I had forgotten, and just assumed that he was at the hospital or out with Mirei. So ... I woke up a half hour after falling asleep, tip-toed into the computer room, turned on the computer and there were no messages. It took a while to fall back asleep, and the fact that the room was so hot didn't help either, so at 3:15 A.M. I was back at the computer, this time with a very welcome message from Bryn saying Riku was a little better, that he and Mirei would visit them tomorrow, and that they had had a good day together. It's not often that she and her Dad have that much time alone, so I know that both of them enjoyed it very much. </p>
<p>Bryn had also let me know that he had posted three new blogs, so I went to his site and was delighted to see those two happy little faces, but did not dare turn up the volume so I could hear Mirei practicing on Riku's mouth piano! </p>
<p>Of course I was so relieved to hear that Riku was a little better, that my mind didn't stop whirling once I got to bed. At 4 A.M. I had to turn on the light and immerse myself in the fictional tale of the folks in Gail's Liverpool novel. It worked and I woke at 8:15!</p>
<p>So, on with our planned day out at a lovely waterfall ... Gail had been busy packing up fresh fruit, peppers, and drinks, and so after our usual game of cards with fruit and tea for breakfast, I made lentil loaf sandwiches for Tom and Doug, Gail packed up our favourite two salads, Greek and taboulleh, and off we went. </p>
<p>We left the house at 10:45 and headed off to the North Island Recovery Centre, about an hour or so away. It is a very well maintained huge shelter, with animals and birds kept both inside and outside in large clean pens and cages. All of the animals were rescued from sure deaths, and it was so inspiring to see wounded birds learning to fly again, and a baby bear in a huge bathtub dipping up and down in obvious delight. There were crows, ravens, owls, ducks, with lots of little children around paying lots of attention to them. Some big folks too!  As well as all of these, there was a huge exhibit room filled with various species of birds, including injured eagles in their own special room with lots of room to spread their wings, and fly... or at least move around safely, until they healed. There were insect collections too, and large animals such as cougars, all of whom had been rescued many many years ago, and their bodies preserved after death in the learning center. </p>
<p>We were very hungry and drove on until we reached our picnic spot, at the lovely Little Qualicum Falls. Tom has fond memories of visiting there as a boy, and hadn't been for years. There was a table in the shade for us, and after our very welcome and delicious lunch (especially since we were all really hungry by the time we got there), and a thermos of hot tea for Gail and me, we set off on a somewhat arduous but perfectly gorgeous hike up and down to a series of waterfalls. We took lots of photos, or at least Doug did, as waterfalls count among his very favourite things. We all agreed it was a lovely way to have finished up this part of our day. </p>
<p>On to Coombs, famed location of the market with the goats on the roof. It has grown and changed over the years from when we first went with Gail and Tom, and all the food items have become pricier than they used to be, but they still have a great and varied selection of goodies. We bought two large Cadbury's Fruit and Nut bars, imported from England, one of our favourite non-dark bars, some shortbread cookies for the drive home, and Doug found some cream-filled cookies to nibble on. He was tempted by the smell of the wonderful cheese bread they bake there, but the $6.00 price tag had him decide against buying it. We don't really have enough days left to do it justice anyway. Gail picked up some small whole wheat buns and a few other items too. </p>
<p>The long ice cream counter had been moved to an outside location, but thank goodness still had the coconut ice cream Gail and I enjoy so much. It was hot outside but we found a shady spot to eat most of it, and then Gail and I finished ours off in the car on the way home. </p>
<p>Of course this meant no one was very hungry for dinner, so Gail and I played cards, we changed into our lightweight dressing gowns early as it was too hot to wear anything else, and ended up with a late dinner of marinated grilled tofu, along with grilled new potatoes and asparagus. </p>
<p>I called Beth's and spoke first with Candy, and then with Beth, who sounded well, and with the good news that all her tests had come back fine. This means she didn't have a heart attack,  but her loud snoring during her night at the hospital brought her sleep apnea to the attention of the staff, who strongly recommended that she get her sleeping mask asap. She promised she would. </p>
<p>Paul had joined Beth, Candy, and Rick for lunch at The Mandarin Buffet, after his chemotherapy session today. Gerry and Lionel were there with Tanner as well,  so they all had a good time out together. </p>
<p>Bryn rang through on Skype just as I was wondering if we were going to hear from him today, and it was such a pleasure to get the latest news on Riku right from him ... he may be released from the hospital tomorrow(!), his fever is down, and he is having another blood test tomorrow. Poor wee guy; those needles are no fun at all and I hate to think of him having to get another one done. </p>
<p>Mirei was so happy to not only talk to her Grandpa, Auntie Gail, and Nana, but to see them too! She wanted to talk to Tom as well but he had gone to bed. It was quite late for us to be up, but well worth being able to chat with Mirei, hear her sing a Japanese song to us, and entertain us with her energy and sheer happiness.</p>
<p>I stayed up until just past midnight, having some quiet time to talk to her too, before we said goodbye. She told me several times she wanted to come to my house, and to come to play there, and how I wish she could come sooner too, rather than later ... but very grateful that I am going to see her before November! </p>
<p>Bed time at 12:30 A.M., feeling much much more ready for sleep tonight, with both Beth and Riku on the mend. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/post_5.html">A Cidery Lunch and a Dockside Dinner</a></h2>
								<p>This was just a perfect day! I loved every minute of it from beginning to end. We had decided that we would have luncheon at the little bistro cafe at the Merrivale Cider Works, the place the gal at the Fox and Hounds had suggested we go. I was determined to take home a few bottles of their cider with me, the only place to buy it commercially, and she had praised the little bistro too. </p>
<p>We were not disappointed. Tucked away among some back roads in the Cowichan Valley, it was a delightful spot, and Gail and Tom decided after lunch that they would go back one day when on their way to Victoria. The main dining area is a big spacious airy room, with casual but attentive service; there was also an enclosed patio, and a larger room where groups were gathered to eat. The food was delicious, although Doug was disappointed there wasn't more for vegetarians. Even the mac' and cheese had pepperoni in it! </p>
<p>Gail and I decided to share our lunches, including two soups. One was especially good ... a cream of parsnip and apple soup, and the other was a pureed fresh tomato, carrot, and basil combination, which would have been even better if smoothed out with a little milk or cream. We enjoyed our fruit, cheese, and cracker platter too. Tom had a curried chicken salad sandwich on their homemade grainy bread, while Doug settled for a Caesar salad. Both had the homemade apple pie for dessert, Doug with a custard on top, and Tom with ice cream. They were both happy campers with their dessert choices, and Gail and I enjoyed our big pots of tea with lots of milk. </p>
<p>Then it was time for our self-guided tour of the apple orchard. This was quite a wonderful experience, as it is the largest cider apple grove in B.C. and possibly in all of Canada. They have vintage apple trees from England and France, as well as Canadian cider apple trees. All were clearly labelled, letting us know what each of their characteristics were and how they blend them. No pesticides or herbicides are used on any of their trees, meaning lower production for them, but with higher quality too. The grounds were so well taken care of, with lots of fun things to see ... tiny doors and windows seemingly set into the bottoms of the trees on the property for the "faeries", as well as wooden chairs and hand carved benches for sitting on during the stroll. </p>
<p>Gail, Tom, and I finished up with a free cider tasting, trying six of of their most popular ones. The "house" blend which I like was not one of them, since it is so close to another but higher in alcohol content. I only liked two of them, and bought three bottles of each, but I plan to buy some each time we are there. </p>
<p>We took our time wandering around, taking photos, and were in no rush to get home, as it had been such a relaxing day. Gail and I decided that it was our last night for fish and chips on the dock, and we had better not miss out on that. They are Gail's very favourite fish and chips, and so after tea and cards, and a little computer time, we drove downtown, and walked to the dock after parking at the mall. It was a little chilly and I was sorry I didn't have a jacket with me, but I wouldn't have missed those fish and chips for anything. They are absolutely my favourite fish and chips in the area! Yum! Neither Gail nor I finished our chips, as the two pieces of fish were very generous in size. </p>
<p>So ends our second last night here; the time is going by too fast, of course, but we sure are having fun! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/post_6.html">An (Unexpected!) Early Birthday Party with Friends</a></h2>
								<p>A few weeks ago, Gail had arranged a luncheon at her home and invited Judi and Jody for our once-a-year visit together. Gail had the menu all arranged: a fresh tomato and bread salad, cheese, olives, hummous and thin crusty bread, and, at the last moment, a small bowl of our freshly made clam chowder too. </p>
<p>I asked a couple of times about dessert, and Gail mysteriously said it was all taken care of, and was a surprise. I was sure she was going to send Tom out for some special treat, but he was in the house with us all morning. I was curious as to why Jody, our always loyal cake maker, wasn't baking a cake. Gail mumbled that she might just be too busy with the B&B. </p>
<p>Judi arrived on the 10:10 ferry, and Tom and Doug went down to pick her up. The boys went off for lunch and to run some errands, while Gail, Judi, and I sat chatting, waiting for Jody. I finally called her, as it was just past noon, and she said all she had to do was pack up the cake and she would be on her way! The gig was up; she was bringing my birthday cake(!) with her, and it was to have been a surprise for me. It was for sure! I hadn't given my birthday a thought this early. </p>
<p>We sat and caught up a bit on our news, and then had our lunch. I was really hungry by this time, and enjoyed every bite of my food, especially the delicious chiffon cake with orange peel, beautifully decorated with white icing and a huge flower. It tasted as delicious as it looked! </p>
<p>I even got lots of unexpected gifts(!) ... homemade jams and jellies from Judi, my old favourite empire biscuits Judi had somehow managed to find, cookie cutters to make my own biscuits(!), a lovely candle, a big gorgeous bar of pear soap, and birthday cards too. Gail had already treated me to lots of early birthday gifts, but she found a perfect book for me, a comedy, about a traveller in Japan. Lucky me! </p>
<p>Settling down in the living room with our tea and wine, the afternoon just disappeared. Judi missed the 5:30 ferry back and so we had another two hours together. It was lovely on the deck by this time; the morning had been a little cooler, and it was just a great way to end our time together. </p>
<p>Gail had made Tom and Doug dinner around 5:30, even taking the time to prepare what turned out to be a really tasty lobster thermidor-style dish, using the lobster from Bayfield in P.E.I, and baking it with a little parmesan cheese after mixing it in a light cream sauce. Doug was thrilled to bits with it, and Tom enjoyed it too. </p>
<p>It was a perfectly relaxing day, and a wonderful last day here. I did pack up my suitcase which didn't take long, but vetoed the original plan Doug had suggested for leaving ... on a 6:30 A.M. ferry, which meant leaving at 5:30. We decided that leaving on the 7:55 was just fine; this is the second last day of our holiday after all! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/post_7.html">Nanaimo, B.C. to Grants Pass, Oregon</a></h2>
								<p>Gail was up packing sandwiches and snacks for our trip when I got up to shower this morning, and less than an hour later we were lined up for our 7:40 ferry trip. Doug had eaten his usual breakfast, so went off to read the local papers while Gail and Tom treated me to an egg, hash browns, toast, and tea breakfast. After Tom left to join Doug in the seats, Gail and I had more tea with our usual three hands of cards. A gal Gail had worked with, who is still working on the ferry, kindly took a photo of us outside on the deck of the ferry. We said goodbye to them, with big hugs and many thanks when we docked, and Doug and I were off on our way home. </p>
<p>We went through a smaller border crossing, and heard on our way there that there was an hour and a half wait at the Peace Arch. We didn't mind our quick half-hour wait at all! The day was still cool at this point, and we enjoyed our drive through Washington State, stopping at a Safeway store for the cheapest gas of the trip. It was advertised at $2.66 per gallon, with a three cent discount if you had a Safeway card, which we do, but Doug said somehow he ended up paying just $2.55! We went into the store and bought Bing cherries, almost as good as the B.C. cherries, but paid only 99¬¢ a pound.</p>
<p>We ate our yummy sandwiches for lunch in the car ... lentil loaf for Doug and tuna for me on the small whole wheat buns Gail bought at Coombs on Thursday. </p>
<p>"Yum Yum", the caf√© in Eugene, Oregon, where we had stopped in on the way to Nanaimo, was our choice for dinner again today. We both ended up ordering exactly what we had the last time, but I took photos of the meals today. I had more tofu in my dish, which was just fine with me! We worked on a sudoku puzzle while I finished up my tea. We also stopped into an Old Navy to check out the sales, and found a cute very lightweight blue checked blouse for me ($15) and a red Transformer t-shirt for Riku for just $10.</p>
<p>We made very good time all day, with light traffic but by the time we were in southern Oregon, the day was heating up and it wasn't very comfortable. We drove a little longer than I would have liked, but made it to within an hour of the California border at Grants Pass. There was a huge Motel 6 there, but with only one "smoking room" left; there were lots of loud parties going on so I was very happy to hear they couldn't accommodate us. We drove to another privately owned motel but it was a little pricey for what it was, so on we went to get the last queen non-smoking room at a Super Eight Motel instead. The price included a continental breakfast too, and the room was large and airy with a good Internet connection. </p>
<p>Doug turned the AC on high and checked his messages, while I took a quick shower and lounged on the bed. I was tired, but wanted to see if there was any word about Riku from Bryn, and there was, but it was worrisome. He sent a link to the name of the infection Riku has/had and Doug and I clicked through several different connections on the link to see the cause and result. Thank goodness I knew that Riku was on the mend, because reading about it was scary. A large number of young children die from it ... and some are deaf as a result of it. It was especially strange as all Riku's immunizations are up to date. I am so glad to know that Riku's fever has gone, and that he might be out of the hospital very soon. </p>
<p>There was a beautiful sliver of a moon in the sky the last hour or so of our drive. Riku and I had made a pact that when we missed each other we would look up into the sky, day or night, and think about each other. That little boy was on my mind all night. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/grants_pass_oregon_to_san_fran.html">Grants Pass, Oregon to San Francisco, California</a></h2>
								<p>We both slept very well last night with the air conditioner on high the entire night. We didn't set an alarm and I woke at 7:20; Doug was already in the shower. After the continental breakfast served at the motel (Doug had a tiny cinnamon bun, and juice; I had hot chocolate ... nothing else appealed to me!), we were on the road at 8:20. </p>
<p>The day was still cool, and we were happy to be making headway without dealing with the heat. Ideally we would have been up and out much earlier, but it's never a fun way for me to start my day at any time, and especially when we are on holiday. I had washed the cherries I bought yesterday so we snacked on those, and enjoyed the scenery through the most southern part of Oregon, mountainous and heavily treed in some areas, and then slowly coming into the desert stretches and more mountainous parts of northern California. </p>
<p>I couldn't resist taking photos from the car window as Mt. Shasta came into view. It is so beautiful, over 14,000 feet with lots of snow still on top ... quite lovely to look at as we sweltered along I-5, and even though most of the shots were blurry, I was happy with the three photos we saved. </p>
<p>We stopped for a late brunch in Mt. Shasta (the town), at what we thought was an independent diner (later we learned there are fortyof them in six western states). It was very crowded, and the fifteen-minute wait stretched to a full half hour, and then we waited quite a long time for our breakfast. However, the "Black Bear Diner" was filled with lots of interesting bits to look at: painted hand saws on the walls, cute decor, and along with our eggs and toast, they served up really generous helpings of potatoes ... mine pan fried "breakfast potatoes" with red pepper, red potatoes, and onion,  and Doug's homemade hash browns.  My very busy (and pregnant) server was kind enough to give me extra hot water with lots of milk without being reminded.This meal took much longer than we thought it would, but we knew we wouldn't be stopping for another on the way home after such a large feast. Doug took another photo of the mountain before we got back on the highway. </p>
<p>The rest of the trip was long and very hot. We kept passing signs that showed the temperature ... at one point it was 96F, and the weather report from Medford said the high in the area was going to be 100F. I'm sure it was, as we gave in and turned on the AC a few times just to cool off a bit. We hit some slow traffic after Vacaville; we stopped for gas there, filling up at $2.76 a gallon, but weren't tempted to stop to shop at the outlet mall at all. It was hot enough that all I wanted to do was see that San Francisco fog rolling in across the hills, and get home to a cool house. </p>
<p>We weren't disappointed at all, and what a treat to feel that cool air coming in the windows! A stop at Rainbow Grocery for milk, sourdough bread, and eggs, and we went right home, unpacked the car quickly, and here we are!</p>
<p>Doug went upstairs to unpack, I put away all the downstairs items, and for dinner polished off the last bits of the two salads that Gail had packed for me ‚Äî the yummy Greek and tabbouleh, with some sourdough bread to dip in the latter. Dessert was one of the delicious Empire biscuits that Judi had bought as a birthday treat for me.</p>
<p>I drifted off a bit while finishing the last of my tea in the living room reading, and Doug too sat down and drifted off for a few minutes. He went up to bed earlier than I did, while I couldn't resist spending a half hour (or more) on my family tree. </p>
<p>Bryn and Riku arrive in just two and a half days! Yahoo!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/catching_up_at_home.html">Catching Up at Home</a></h2>
								<p>Short blog today, since I spend the entire day here catching up on all sorts of things: did the laundry, wrote some letters, organized some cards to be mailed out, finished the last of the unpacking upstairs, put away all the goodies from our trip (cans of favourite custard for the children, new fun toys), wrote a few emails, watered my lovely flowers at the front door, read through some magazines Gail had passed on, enjoyed my very late breakfast of Acme sourdough bread with egg, "bacon", and two cups of hot tea while reading the paper, chatted with Susan and Finn on the phone, and let Doug go off to a double feature on his own so that I could do all of the above. Took a break later on for one of my empire biscuits from Judi and my afternoon tea. Even though it looks different from the ones we used to get, it tasted every bit as good as they used to. Yum! </p>
<p>I got lots done but somehow it felt like a long lazy day, and I enjoyed it all. The house looks so good and I am inspired to continue going through all the rest of the little sorting jobs that need tending to. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/tomorrow_starts_the_beginning.html">Tomorrow Starts the Beginning of a Very Busy and Fun Summer and Fall</a></h2>
								<p>The day stretched out ahead of me today, with nothing planned but continuing to catch up on odd jobs, work on my blogs, write some emails, and hand write letters too. </p>
<p>I made myself a list and happily crossed off item after item as I went through them all. I watered the garden, chose photos for the blogs on our trip home, worked a couple of Sudoku puzzles, read a few magazines Gail had passed on to me, and generally just puttered about getting lots done. </p>
<p>Bryn Skyped through today and what a treat this was! Akane, Riku, and Mirei had gone right to Osaka after Riku's release from the hospital on Sunday, after just a couple of hours at home, for Akane to pack up Riku's clothes for the trip. So, we had a chance for the first time in what seems a long time to chat with the children. </p>
<p>It was officially Wednesday in Japan, and so the children and Bryn sang "Happy Birthday" to me, and then Mirei tried to keep "on camera" as much as she could for the rest of the call. Riku would come in once in a while to try to tell me something, but finally gave up and let his sister entertain me. It was such fun to see both those happy faces, and even though the line kept dropping, we persevered until it was time for them to get ready for their trip to the airport later on today at their end. Mirei promised she would draw me a picture, and off we went. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a really wonderful movie after his class tonight. I had seen a short review of it when it came out in a while back. Doug had ordered the DVD on Netflix, and I am glad he did as we both enjoyed it so much ... a sweet touching story, with humour and pathos, and extremely well acted. The name of this little treasure? "Lars and the Real Girl". Rent it, and smile.  </p>
<p>p.s. The photos posted here are just small snapshots I took while on Skype with Bryn and the children, so they are not high resolution pics and can't be expanded. However, I thought them better than no photos at all!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/bryn_and_riku_arrive.html">Bryn and Riku Arrive!</a></h2>
								<p>Today is my birthday, but I must say that the anticipation of this 64th celebration took second place to the arrival of Bryn and Riku today. I've decided that I can't possibly put all the photos I want to from today in one blog, so I am going to do two instead. First, my day with Riku. </p>
<p>We were at the gate when Riku came barreling towards us, with a grinning Bryn right behind him. I got a great running-to-me big hug and such wonderful smiles from Riku, and then Doug lifted this boy up and got a big hug too. Doug asked him about the flight while he was holding him, and we admired how their shirts matched.</p>
<p>I sat in the back seat with Riku going home, and we held hands all the way. They had a great flight; Riku slept about four hours while Bryn thought he napped for only forty minutes, not feeling tired on this trip at alll. </p>
<p>Riku chattered away telling me all about the movie he saw in great detail, and of how he tried hard to sleep, but couldn't, but then finally did, etc. etc. He was so excited as we pulled into the driveway; he of course noticed and admired the pots of flowers on the landing, and made himself at home immediately. The minute he stepped into the room where he sleeps he realized he had forgotten to bring his little golden yellow dog, Skippy, with him. </p>
<p>Riku is a little slimmer but mostly I noticed how pale he is, but of course he had a long day behind him as well as his stint in the hospital last week. The first thing Riku did was unpack his heavily loaded back pack, show me all his goodies, and then wanted to spend some time in the garden, watering plants and just fooling around with the hose. While he was busy with that, I got his clothes unpacked and put away, and then made him eggs, "bacon", and sourdough toast ... all his favourite breakfast foods when he is here. He made some sweet comment to Bryn about how Nana makes special treats. </p>
<p>After eating, Riku spend a very long time at the table making me a birthday card. I provided him with the supplies ‚Äî blank card, stickers, and a big box of pencil crayons ‚Äî and  then had to keep my eyes averted each time I walked by, as it was to be a surprise for later today. </p>
<p>After finishing it up, and sealing it, he was quite happy puttering about the house, inspecting all the containers on "his" desk, checking out the familiar things in his room, etc. I had wanted to pick up some fresh fruit earlier in the day, but hadn't, so we all set off in the car together. Riku and I got dropped off at the playground on 23rd and Folsom, near their "old" house, while  Bryn and Doug going on to the grocery store and to the bank. Riku was very happy to see that building where he used to live. </p>
<p>The playground wasn't too busy, and Riku seemed happy to just meander about, climb the dome about halfway, and walk the tightrope. Long past the sitting in the sandbox stage, he chose instead to jump through it and across it in one step. He was having such fun in that sandbox, fooling around and just enjoying being off that plane, I'm sure, and out in the fresh air. At one point he spent a lot of time balancing on the sloping edge of the long sandbox, asking me to join him. Soon however, a friendly five-year-old boy started to interact with Riku, calling him by name, and before I knew it they were running off playing hide and seek together, chasing each other, and both climbing the dome as far as Riku has ever climbed before. </p>
<p>Bryn and Doug picked us up at about 5:30 and I shall continue on with the rest of my day in blog number two. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/happy_birthday_to_me_1.html">Happy Birthday to Me!</a></h2>
								<p>My first call of the day started off with a lovely phone call, complete with a rousing rendition of "Happy Birthday to You!" from Amelia, Finn, Susan, and Kevin. I had been lying in bed earlier thinking they would be the first to call, since Amelia is going to a summer camp this week and wouldn't be home until later on. So, it was with delight that I heard those voices first thing in the morning. </p>
<p>My second call of the day was from Judith Sarkany. It has been months since we connected and it took us over an hour and a half to even start to get caught up! By the time we said goodbye, it was time to eat, and get ready to head for the airport. </p>
<p>I wrote in my previous blog entry about Bryn and Riku's arrival and my day with Riku after that, ending with all the fun Riku had at the playground on 23rd Street in the Mission. Here is the rest of the story ... </p>
<p>Bryn and Doug picked us up at the playground about 5:15, and asked if we would like to have dinner at "Little Star" pizzeria, one of our favourite pizza spots, although we usually take the pizza home. This is always a very busy spot, but we lucked out and got a table right away. Riku spent the time drawing a very elaborate picture of a hammock with all the details of a lazy afternoon included... a bowl of fresh fruit, a purse, sunglasses, drinks, table, palm tree. Sweet!  We all enjoyed every bite of our two different types of deep dish pizza, and then headed for home. </p>
<p>Bryn had a lovely bouquet of flowers for me, and there was a delicious spice/carrot cake from "Just Desserts" on our traditional crystal platter, used since the very first year of our marriage. Riku was thrilled to bits with the celebration, and grinned his way through the candle blowing and the unwrapping of the gifts. </p>
<p>Doug gave me a gift that made Riku happy too, three different kinds of hot chocolate mix, including one with marshmallows. I was delighted with the nice assortment of my semi-annual collection of books, tea from Nova Scotia, as well as a soft scarf in the blue Nova Scotia plaid. I also got a new and quite adorable toothbrush holder for travelling; it has a little face on it, and sticks to the mirror so the toothbrush can dry out, and yet is protected too. </p>
<p>Bryn made a fresh pot of tea, we all enjoyed the cake, and then it was tuck-n time for Riku, sound asleep at 9 P.M., later than I had hoped this first night, but asleep in minutes, thank goodness. This jet lag business can be tough! </p>
<p>I had missed three birthday phone calls while I was out, but all three left recordings, which is always fun. I taped them and will get to hear them many times again this way! All were singing messages too, from Kelly, Gregg, & Caillie, Gail & Tom, and Candy, Tara, Rick perhaps but included Kaitlin & Lauren too, so I wasn't sure. I did talk with Sheldon and Donna in the afternoon, and Marie called as well. </p>
<p>There were also lots of birthday wishes on Facebook, many email messages and cards, and a lovely group of cards on the mantel as well. My favourites are always the homemade cards, and this year there was one from Amelia, a sweet bunnies drawing, signed by her family, of course, and the card that Riku made this morning. </p>
<p>I always think about the call my mom made to me each year on the 29th. Depending on when she called, she would fill me in on what was going on so many years ago at that time ... for example, "Thirty three years ago, I was just an hour away from finding out that your brothers had a little sister." And she always ended the story with my birth "at eleven A.M.,on a beautiful Sunday morning when the church bells were ringing", and the nurses put me into a pale green nightie as they thought it suited my red hair. Touching memories from all those yesterdays... and today. </p>
<p>It was a lovely birthday!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/post_8.html">A New Playground and a Lemon Too!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku and I made up a list of things he wanted to do on this trip, something Bryn, Caillie, and I always did, and then Myk' and Bryant too. On Riku's list is to visit old and new playgrounds and today he got to cross off two of the as-yet-unknown playgrounds we plan to visit. This was a brand new one for us; a large area between our local Safeway and Akane's old art studio. One of the neighbourhood groups petitioned to have the badly neglected and very old playground replaced, and they managed to get a wonderful one built. Doug had a luncheon engagement not far away, so he dropped us off and we spent an hour and a half there. </p>
<p>I had bought a set of badminton rackets and after Riku discovered them, he was very keen to try them out. So we took those along, and this turned out to be a perfect place to practice. As well as a wonderfully set up playground with areas for both young and older children, there is a large open green space not far from a fenced-off soccer field. We had this whole spot to ourselves and it was a good thing, as those birdies went flying here and there and everywhere. Riku was able to hit them both behind and in front of him, while I tended to whack them far off to one side. We sure had fun, though! </p>
<p>We did go off so Riku could explore the play area too. They have a great set of balancing platters set up, so Riku tried those out, and watched as some older children crawled over and through linked loops as well. He agreed with me that Mirei will love the train on her next visit; it's a good sized one, and the bell rings too. </p>
<p>As soon as Riku had cooled down he wanted to get back to the badminton play, which is where Doug found us when he returned to pick us up. </p>
<p>We spent the rest of the day at home, with Riku working in the garden looking for bugs again, and watering the plants. Later on we snuggled on the sofa and read one of our very few books in the house suitable for Riku. I sent almost all of his books to Japan with him, not expecting him back so soon, so a visit to the library is planned. </p>
<p>Bryn and Riku went out for a walk as I was preparing dinner, but it was a very short one! They discovered a ripe Meyer lemon on the tree across the street, came back for a footstool, and went back to pick it. We shall make a lemon pudding cake with it sometime this week. Riku was just as pleased as punch, as Brynnie was when he picked lemons from the same tree on all of his spring visits with us. </p>
<p>Bryn went off for dinner at Susan's and Kevin's and to visit the children there, and Doug was at  his T'ai Chi class, so Riku and I had a quiet dinner and evening together. He had a long relaxing tub, we read a story snuggled up in his bed, and he was sound asleep at 8 P.M.  </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/rikus_long_visit_with_kai.html">Riku's Long Visit with Kai</a></h2>
								<p>Riku was anxious to have a playdate with Kai today, a classmate from his Japanese nursery school program. I called while Riku was having breakfast and Kai's dad said it worked out fine for them, as Kai starts in at a summer camp program next week. I am so pleased I called, as this might be the one last week day these two have together. </p>
<p>Riku and I walked over to Kai's house at 10:30 (and how sweet it was to see them walking hand in hand for part of the trip home) and the two boys were together until we met up with Kai's dad and little sister at 3:30 at yet another playground. </p>
<p>What fun they had in between those hours; they got along so very well, happily going from one project to another here at the house. They started off by building a playground and log cabin with the log set, and Riku called on Doug at one point to help out with the roof. They spent a long long time in the garden, mostly digging in the dirt trying to find bugs. How I wish I could just rent lots of interesting bugs for the next month, as the occasional spider and a few pill bugs aren't very exciting. They certainly persevered though. </p>
<p>They had a good lunch together, sitting chatting at the table over their grilled cheese sandwiches, as requested, and a plate with cherries, carrot sticks, and a mandarin orange each. Later they snacked on cheese, cookies, and nuts, and lots of apple juice and water after their time in the garden. </p>
<p>We walked over to what Riku calls "Kai's playground", as it is just a block away from Kai's house. The playground on 23rd is "Riku's playground", and the one at the top of the hill here, which we haven't yet been to on this visit, is known as "Nana's playground". So far, the one we went to yesterday is being referred to as "the new playground", although that might change as we discover new ones. </p>
<p>The boys had a great time together while we waited for Kai's dad to arrive. They each had a Frisbee with them, and as it was quite windy they were running after them following each and every throw ... from the tops of the slides, across the grassy area, and onto the play area when there weren't too many children around. </p>
<p>Riku was delighted to see Kei's adorable one-and-a-half-year-old sister, Evi. She reminds me a lot of Mirei, as she is determined and fearless and independent. Riku followed her everywhere, pushed her on the swing, made sure she was safe on the round-about, took her hand when she let him, and gave her a hug and kiss goodbye when we left them at 3:45 P.M.</p>
<p>Bryn went off to a movie this afternoon, and he and Riku left for a visit and dinner at Susan's and Kevin's, joining another friend of Amelia's,  as well as a friend of Susan's, her two children, and a friend of the friend too. It was a busy fun night for them all; they arrived home at 8:30. </p>
<p>Doug and I had watched a movie so that we can order "Spiderman" for Riku from Netflix. He is quite keen to watch it, so we had to send one off for this to happen. It forced me to just put my feet up and relax and not sit at the computer trying to catch up, a hopeless task at this stage. </p>
<p>Riku wanted dessert when he got home, and by the time he had that, and talked about his visit, and asked about plans for tomorrow, and the usual bedtime routine, it was 9:30 when I closed his door. He was asleep again tonight in about three minutes! I think his dad was, too, as he had been working in the bedroom, and I didn't hear a peep out of him. I turned off his light and shut his door at 11 o'clock when I headed up to bed myself.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/07/mirei_sleeping_through_the_nig.html">Mirei sleeping through the night on her own</a></h2>
								<p>I forgot to mention Mirei sleeping on her own through the night for two<br />
nights in my last email. This is a big step for her! Please tell her that<br />
her Nana and Grandpa are VERY proud of her!</p>
<p>I know Riku will love having her sleeping in the same room with him too,<br />
so good luck with this. I guess that won't be able to continue in Sakai<br />
which is a shame. It would have been nice to have had it well established<br />
by the time you and Riku got home again at the end of August.<br />
