								<h2>Gardening Day and PoBoys for the Girls!</h2>
								<p>Tonight is the night for putting out the composting bin, which meant that Gail and I spent about an hour and a half in the garden this morning, filling it up with all the debris that Susan, Kevin, the children, and I collected up last week in our marathon gardening days. Doug did his usual  jumping up and down in the bin, which meant we actually got a huge amount of the leaves, pine needles, and branches in the container. I was sure it was going to take three weeks to get rid of it all! We couldn't get it all in though, and so I called our next door neighbours to see if we could use whatever room they had left in their half size container. Lo and behold, we managed to get the entire brick covered area free of all the debris! </p>
<p>Doug trimmed some dead branches from a tree overhanging the area, clipped the bigger branches for me while I swept up, and then took down a wooden wall that was put up a few years ago to keep out the downstairs neighbour's dog. I have always hated the look of it, and it was time to get rid of it. It needs more attention tomorrow, after Gail and I get rid of a lot of overgrown ivy in the area, I am hoping the last of that small ugly structure can come down. </p>
<p>I finished off the last of the tidying up and sorting in the laundry room, while Gail got out the hose with a new nozzle on it, and did a grand job of cleaning the big windows over and at the back of the kitchen eating area. It looks just wonderful! </p>
<p>Tom and Doug left for Berkeley just past noon. They have plans to be out all day and evening, with lunch at Barney's, book and record stores, dinner out, and finishing off at the "Freight and Salvage" for a concert tonight.</p>
<p>Gail and I left right after they did for a walk to drop magazines off at the hospital, and then 'round the block to pick up our shared PoBoy sandwich, a vegetarian Philly Melt. While we were waiting for our order, Gail spotted some fries being delivered to a table, and thought we should have some too. She was treating to lunch, and had only $2 left on her, but the friendly gal said we could get a half order for that and not to worry about the tax. Gail found 16 cents and I took that up to her, and out of the goodness of her heart this gal delivered a piping hot plate of fries to us, surely a full order! </p>
<p>We shared our sandwich when we arrived home, made tea, and of course played cards before working on our family trees again. We just cannot believe how quickly time passes when we're involved with this project, as it was almost four o'clock before we stopped to have some cherries for a snack. </p>
<p>French onion soup and a big spinach salad for an early dinner, after which I chose photos for my blogs, and we both answered some emails. Gail worked on her tree a little longer, we had an extra game of cards ... and then it was bedtime, both tired after a busy day and lots of exercise and fresh air. </p>
