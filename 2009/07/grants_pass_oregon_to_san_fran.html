								<h2>Grants Pass, Oregon to San Francisco, California</h2>
								<p>We both slept very well last night with the air conditioner on high the entire night. We didn't set an alarm and I woke at 7:20; Doug was already in the shower. After the continental breakfast served at the motel (Doug had a tiny cinnamon bun, and juice; I had hot chocolate ... nothing else appealed to me!), we were on the road at 8:20. </p>
<p>The day was still cool, and we were happy to be making headway without dealing with the heat. Ideally we would have been up and out much earlier, but it's never a fun way for me to start my day at any time, and especially when we are on holiday. I had washed the cherries I bought yesterday so we snacked on those, and enjoyed the scenery through the most southern part of Oregon, mountainous and heavily treed in some areas, and then slowly coming into the desert stretches and more mountainous parts of northern California. </p>
<p>I couldn't resist taking photos from the car window as Mt. Shasta came into view. It is so beautiful, over 14,000 feet with lots of snow still on top ... quite lovely to look at as we sweltered along I-5, and even though most of the shots were blurry, I was happy with the three photos we saved. </p>
<p>We stopped for a late brunch in Mt. Shasta (the town), at what we thought was an independent diner (later we learned there are fortyof them in six western states). It was very crowded, and the fifteen-minute wait stretched to a full half hour, and then we waited quite a long time for our breakfast. However, the "Black Bear Diner" was filled with lots of interesting bits to look at: painted hand saws on the walls, cute decor, and along with our eggs and toast, they served up really generous helpings of potatoes ... mine pan fried "breakfast potatoes" with red pepper, red potatoes, and onion,  and Doug's homemade hash browns.  My very busy (and pregnant) server was kind enough to give me extra hot water with lots of milk without being reminded.This meal took much longer than we thought it would, but we knew we wouldn't be stopping for another on the way home after such a large feast. Doug took another photo of the mountain before we got back on the highway. </p>
<p>The rest of the trip was long and very hot. We kept passing signs that showed the temperature ... at one point it was 96F, and the weather report from Medford said the high in the area was going to be 100F. I'm sure it was, as we gave in and turned on the AC a few times just to cool off a bit. We hit some slow traffic after Vacaville; we stopped for gas there, filling up at $2.76 a gallon, but weren't tempted to stop to shop at the outlet mall at all. It was hot enough that all I wanted to do was see that San Francisco fog rolling in across the hills, and get home to a cool house. </p>
<p>We weren't disappointed at all, and what a treat to feel that cool air coming in the windows! A stop at Rainbow Grocery for milk, sourdough bread, and eggs, and we went right home, unpacked the car quickly, and here we are!</p>
<p>Doug went upstairs to unpack, I put away all the downstairs items, and for dinner polished off the last bits of the two salads that Gail had packed for me â€” the yummy Greek and tabbouleh, with some sourdough bread to dip in the latter. Dessert was one of the delicious Empire biscuits that Judi had bought as a birthday treat for me.</p>
<p>I drifted off a bit while finishing the last of my tea in the living room reading, and Doug too sat down and drifted off for a few minutes. He went up to bed earlier than I did, while I couldn't resist spending a half hour (or more) on my family tree. </p>
<p>Bryn and Riku arrive in just two and a half days! Yahoo!</p>
