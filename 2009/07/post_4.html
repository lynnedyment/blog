								<h2>Corvallis, Oregon to Nanaimo, B.C.!</h2>
								<p>We had decided the night before not to set alarm clocks, but to get on the road by 8 A.M. unless we were ready earlier. The idea was to slip a note under our doors, but the phone rang at 7 o'clock, so we were up and in the shower immediately. Gail and Tom were awake when their phone also rang (I guess the office hadn't turned off their last wake-up calls, or perhaps they merely like to get their guests up and out early!), so at 7:45, Gail tapped on our door. Tom went down and several trips later had filled up the cooler with ice. </p>
<p>Our first stop was breakfast, just a few doors down from the motel. Veggie options were limited, with meat served with all their meals, so Gail and I ordered side orders of an egg each, potatoes, and shared the toast, with lots of hot tea, of course. Doug and Tom had pancakes, not our "cup of tea" at all. </p>
<p>We settled in for the trip to our next stop, with Tom and Doug in the front seat, and Gail and I happily ensconced with our books, and my sudoku puzzles, stopping to chat now and then, and drinking lots of cold water. The time passed quickly, although we were heading for Mt. Vernon for lunch at one of Doug's and my favourite spots, and were more than ready for it by the time we arrived after 1 o'clock. We sat upstairs for the first time, away from the hustle and bustle downstairs, much busier than I expected it to be on a weekday. The food was delicious, as always. </p>
<p>Gail and I finished off our tea, wandered into the new-age-type gift shop, bought a few cards, and waited for Tom and Doug to come back from their trip to the nearby bookstore. Then it was off to Bellingham, for a stop at Trader Joe's for Gail and Tom, where they stocked up on lots of veggie "bacon", "sausage" patties, and other goodies. Gail bought an insulated bag, which did the trick until we arrived home. </p>
<p>We arrived at the border around 5:30, and had almost no wait at all, with just a few cars ahead of us at Douglas Point. We whizzed right through, with nary a question about anything we were bringing through with us. </p>
<p>The timing was just right for catching the 7:30 ferry out of Horseshoe Bay; we were well ahead in the line-up and sat reading and chatting for the half hour before we boarded. Because of our late lunch, no one was very hungry for on-board eating, but I had a small pizza, Tom and Doug had some sweet potato fries, and Gail and I were more than ready for a hot cuppa and cards once we cleared away the dishes. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug sat enjoying the view, Doug read the local paper, and as always the trip passed quickly. I stepped outside to take a few photos and took a good one of Gail as well as the scenery coming into Nanaimo, beautiful as always. From the time we drove into Vancouver, it all just felt like home to me. </p>
<p>We made one stop at the local grocery store, for a few breakfast items and milk for our tea! By  9:15,  we were unpacking the car, opening windows in the house, Doug and I unpacking our bags, and getting settled into our lovely ready-for-us room, this time with an extra high mattress on it. Gail and Tom bought a new one a few months ago and now both beds are really high! </p>
<p>Of course Gail and I checked our emails, and had a few hands of cards before heading off to bed. Nice to be settled in again, after two long days on the road. </p>
