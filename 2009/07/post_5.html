								<h2>A Cidery Lunch and a Dockside Dinner</h2>
								<p>This was just a perfect day! I loved every minute of it from beginning to end. We had decided that we would have luncheon at the little bistro cafe at the Merrivale Cider Works, the place the gal at the Fox and Hounds had suggested we go. I was determined to take home a few bottles of their cider with me, the only place to buy it commercially, and she had praised the little bistro too. </p>
<p>We were not disappointed. Tucked away among some back roads in the Cowichan Valley, it was a delightful spot, and Gail and Tom decided after lunch that they would go back one day when on their way to Victoria. The main dining area is a big spacious airy room, with casual but attentive service; there was also an enclosed patio, and a larger room where groups were gathered to eat. The food was delicious, although Doug was disappointed there wasn't more for vegetarians. Even the mac' and cheese had pepperoni in it! </p>
<p>Gail and I decided to share our lunches, including two soups. One was especially good ... a cream of parsnip and apple soup, and the other was a pureed fresh tomato, carrot, and basil combination, which would have been even better if smoothed out with a little milk or cream. We enjoyed our fruit, cheese, and cracker platter too. Tom had a curried chicken salad sandwich on their homemade grainy bread, while Doug settled for a Caesar salad. Both had the homemade apple pie for dessert, Doug with a custard on top, and Tom with ice cream. They were both happy campers with their dessert choices, and Gail and I enjoyed our big pots of tea with lots of milk. </p>
<p>Then it was time for our self-guided tour of the apple orchard. This was quite a wonderful experience, as it is the largest cider apple grove in B.C. and possibly in all of Canada. They have vintage apple trees from England and France, as well as Canadian cider apple trees. All were clearly labelled, letting us know what each of their characteristics were and how they blend them. No pesticides or herbicides are used on any of their trees, meaning lower production for them, but with higher quality too. The grounds were so well taken care of, with lots of fun things to see ... tiny doors and windows seemingly set into the bottoms of the trees on the property for the "faeries", as well as wooden chairs and hand carved benches for sitting on during the stroll. </p>
<p>Gail, Tom, and I finished up with a free cider tasting, trying six of of their most popular ones. The "house" blend which I like was not one of them, since it is so close to another but higher in alcohol content. I only liked two of them, and bought three bottles of each, but I plan to buy some each time we are there. </p>
<p>We took our time wandering around, taking photos, and were in no rush to get home, as it had been such a relaxing day. Gail and I decided that it was our last night for fish and chips on the dock, and we had better not miss out on that. They are Gail's very favourite fish and chips, and so after tea and cards, and a little computer time, we drove downtown, and walked to the dock after parking at the mall. It was a little chilly and I was sorry I didn't have a jacket with me, but I wouldn't have missed those fish and chips for anything. They are absolutely my favourite fish and chips in the area! Yum! Neither Gail nor I finished our chips, as the two pieces of fish were very generous in size. </p>
<p>So ends our second last night here; the time is going by too fast, of course, but we sure are having fun! </p>
