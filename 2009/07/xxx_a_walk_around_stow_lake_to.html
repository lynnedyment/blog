								<h2>Stopping to Smell the Roses and a Walk Around Stow Lake</h2>
								<p>It was a little cool and foggy this morning, a good time to stay in and get some chores done until the sun broke through. Doug had lots of computer work to do, and was printing up books this morning, Tom enjoyed sitting in the living room reading with a coffee cup by his side, and after Gail and I had our usual breakfast of a fried egg, sourdough toast, "bacon", and lots of tea, we had a couple of games of cards before getting on with our day too. </p>
<p>We pulled out the two rolling drawers from the front bedroom, and spent about an hour and a half tidying those up. One contains gift wrap, ribbons, bows, boxes, and gift bags and over time they get muddled together. The other is where I store my Creative Memories scrapbooking tools ... scissors, cropping tools, adhesives, etc., as well as some family heritage folders. </p>
<p>I left Gail to finish off the last of the second set, and made a light and tasty homemade Italian soup for lunch. Gail rolled the two sets of very well organized drawers back in the closet, all done and another job crossed off the list! </p>
<p>We had planned to go for a walk around a reservoir just south of the city, but we had no luck in figuring out just how to get there. So, we decided to do another walk on our list, to Stow Lake with a stop at the DeYoung Museum to show Gail and Tom Andy Goldsworthy's "Fault Line," and check out the view of the city from the observation deck at the top of the museum. </p>
<p>After the wonderful view on this very clear day, and before driving to Stow Lake, we stopped in at the wonderful rose garden to smell the roses. When Amelia was just a baby I used to walk her all through this area for her nap, with a stop both coming and going from her house to slowly drift through and take in the scent of hundreds of roses, all sizes and colours. I couldn't resist taking a few photos of some of the really spectacular and well-kept roses, but won't include them all in this blog entry. :) Gail and I decided we really must get back and wander about the entire garden, and perhaps have lunch on the deck outside the museum. </p>
<p>The one mile walk around Stow Lake was Tom's first and he enjoyed it as much as we thought he would. All of the grandchildren have spent time here too, with boat rides around the tiny island in the middle and the slow stroll around the lake. It was as lovely as always, and we had a perfect day for it too. </p>
<p>We didn't see the usual line up of turtles on the logs, but today got to see over twenty of them swimming freely amongst the ducks, and trying to nibble at an apple core. Just around the corner was a heron, successfully catching tiny fish, and we were lucky enough to stand quite close while Doug snapped photos of him/her. </p>
<p>We got home in lots of time before Doug left for his T'ai Chi class, and Gail and I got right to work on our family trees ... me on Doug's computer and Gail on mine. It is so fast to do this sitting just around a corner from each other, as we can scoot our chairs around to see any problems that come up! </p>
<p>Tom and Doug watched a music video upstairs after dinner, and Gail and I had more "tree" time, plus the usual game or two of cards before bedtime. I sure do enjoy having company in my home!</p>
