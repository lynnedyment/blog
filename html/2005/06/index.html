								<h2><a href="/2005/06/celebrating_toms_first_day_of.html">Celebrating Tom's First Day of Retirement</a></h2>
								<p>Gail and Tom were both still sleeping when I awoke at 8:30 today; Gail was up soon after and Tom not much later. They went to bed at 2 a.m., after a very successful party (but with tears too), last night at the ferry terminal on Tom's last watch ever. </p>
<p>Tom wanted to celebrate his first day off by buying us brunch at a restaurant they had never tried before... "The Old Dutch Inn"; the waitresses wear Dutch costumes, complete with hats, but not wooden shoes... a little disappointing. We had a later start then intended, so were all more than ready for food at 1 p.m. Gail and I shared grilled gouda sandwiches and an egg salad sandwich, both with fries, and a big pot of tea. Tom and Doug had an egg dish, one with ham and one with gouda cheese, with fries on the side as well. Our window seat came with a lovely view of the water. </p>
<p>Turns out that Jody and Hal's place was just around the corner and two blocks away, so that was our next stop. We did the grand tour, starting with the lovely gardens, which I hadn't walked around in the rain yesterday. Jody served her delicious coconut cake, we took some photos outside, and within an hour were on our way to Coombe's. </p>
<p>There was a goat on the roof, but the grass is high and we don't think they have been very busy up there. We puttered about there for a bit, buying a few gifts and resisting the coconut ice cream. </p>
<p>Stopped for an hour at Costco to have Gail's films developed, bought some camisoles, and looked at the photos of Tom's first retirement event while driving to Etta's with bananas for her. She showed Doug around the retirement home, and we sat once again and looked at the last of the photos of Japan. Etta had been reading the blogs Gail printed out for her so she was very happy to see some of what she had read about. </p>
<p>Home after 7:30; Gail made Doug and Tom dinner... vegie hot Italian "sausages" on whole wheat rosemary (fabulous!) rolls, with potato salad, radishes, and olives, while I made the two of us a bowl of fruit salad and yogurt. An hour of "The Nanny", tea, cards, a load of laundry, some tv for Tom, computering for Doug, and our evening came to a close... after a relaxing day out. Bed for me at 11:30... but not sleeping at 12:30 a.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/a_lovely_busy_day_out.html">A Lovely Busy Day Out</a></h2>
								<p>After the most sleepless night of my life, I believe... awake until almost 4 a.m. and awake at 7:45, the day was a very satisfying one. Gail and I had a lazy morning, with cards, tea and my hot water, and a half of a banana each!, we went off for lunch with Tom and Doug. Gail made massage reservations for us for Saturday before we left so we have that to look forward to. </p>
<p>Lunch was booked for 12:30 at "McLean's" in downtown Nanaimo. We ate at this wonderful little restaurant last year too. Gail was hoping they would have their most delicious cream of mushroom soup today; she was very disappointed she didn't have any for lunch yesterday, so I called to find out what the soup was. Mushroom it was, but told her it was cauliflower and cheese; what a nice surprise for her when the waitress told us that the soup de jour was mushroom! </p>
<p>Gail and I both love dunking good bread in good cream soup, and dunk we did. We ordered a crusty panini roll and an order of their homemade focaccia and shared them. Perfect! ... and we cleaned out every last bit of our bowls with the bread. Doug and Tom had soup as well, and both had bread pudding for dessert, Doug's with custard. As we sat at the window table having lunch, Hal, Jody's husband, tapped on the window and came over to say hello; he was there to pick up three loaves of the focaccia for the B&B guests (although he hoped that he would get to eat some too!). They went off book hunting while Gail and I sat and enjoyed a big pot of tea, complete with cozy, and two small scones each with Devon cream and raspberry jam. </p>
<p>We all went off to the post office to mail some parcels and cards; Tom and Doug went off to more bookstores, while Gail and I went into the casino (leaving soon thereafter as the machines just were not co-operating) and then poked into some local stores. Nice to just wander about, not in a rush to go anywhere, and walk off the scones. </p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon was spent in various stores and malls as we all had some things we wanted to buy. Doug pointed out a coconut Roger's chocolate to me as I left a card store, so of course I could not resist that, and Gail bought a couple of birthday gifts. Doug and I were looking for an electric grill like Gail and Tom have; I especially would love to roast vegetables and "burgers" on it, and tofu too. Decided to try to find it in the States instead, as well as a small pool for the patio that we could set up for the Amelia and Riku this summer.</p>
<p>Arrived home about 7 p.m. Kelly had left an IM message for me; it has been about five weeks since I have had much contact with her and it was just wonderful "chatting" with her and catching up on her news and sharing mine with her. They have laid sod in the backyard!, are having a big barbecue party on Saturday for old friends of Gregg's, and everyone sounds happy and well. Caillie has had her hair cut short! Can't wait to see the photo that Kelly promised to send out in a day or two. </p>
<p>I felt a little guilty chatting on the computer as I had intended to wash the little pototoes for dinner while Gail prepared the asparagus. However, she was very organized, had the potatoes steaming away when I joined her in the kitchen, the wild salmon steaks on her indoor grill, and the asparagus already grilled and on a plate.... what a perfectly wonderful dinner we had! </p>
<p>Becky and Wayne had given Gail a jar of caramel sauce with cranberries for Christmas, and Gail had been waiting for the perfect occasion to open it. Wow! What a treat, served over vanilla Haagen-Dazs ice cream. Tom resisted (he was going off to a fellow ferry worker's retirement shift) although he did open a bottle of wine for the two of us to share over dinner. </p>
<p>Candy called with the results of a test done last week; she has flying colours on her blood work! but also had xrays done on her neck and spine. We had some good laughs before hanging up; Gail was busy with laundry after they chatted for a bit. </p>
<p>Cards and tea, and some quiet time reading on the sofa before reading my emails... a wonderful long one from Bryn with lots of Riku information for me! and another from Don, saying he and Beth have just signed the papers for a new home! ...</p>
<p>And now...  off to bed at 11:20 p.m. It was a perfectly wonderful day.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/from_idaho_to_utah.html">From  Idaho to Utah</a></h2>
								<p>A nice early start to our day; we were up, showered, Doug partook of the continental breakfast offered in the lobby (Tang and a sticky-bicky), and off we went at 7:20 a.m. I had a banana in the car a little later on, a few almonds and some grapes too!, saving myself for breakfast on the road. I don't ever have two eggs at home but look forward to this and taters and toast with jam when I'm travelling by car; it's a treat! </p>
<p>We stopped for gas ($2.39 a gallon filled by a nice man who would like to get to California one day) and oil before leaving town. It was sunny and bright as we started out, but the day got cloudy and overcast as we drove along. We passed long low hills with camoflage colouring; it was easy to pick out the black and white dairy cows wandering among the shrubbery. There was a factory, another factory that had been abandoned, some llamas!, a few sheep, and signs for deer. Alas, we saw only one dead one, and realized that we saw more deer in the neighbourhoods of Nanaimo than we did this entire trip! </p>
<p>Doug found a great Spanish radio station and we enjoyed the lively music as we drove along. Doug was reminded of the song "The Road Goes on Forever and the Highway Never Ends". Occasionally we are able to pick up NPR but mostly we have country music stations sliding in and out. </p>
<p>At 8:45 a.m. we drove through Ontario and left the State of Oregon for Idaho. We didn't see one potato growing but perhaps it is too early to see much. Stopped at their "Welcome to Idaho" building, took some photos, and Doug was happy to see that one can drive at 75 miles an hour here; it is the first time he can remember seeing that number on a sign. The roads were mostly empty, certainly of cars, and we shared the road with truckers, few and far between, passing a few of Bryn's favourite "England" trucks... large, shiny silver-coloured trucks that we had first noticed when we drove from Toronto to SF years ago.</p>
<p>We passed Sand Hollow, and Nampa on our way to Boise, with evangelical signs to speed us on our way, quoting scriptures, that would make it hard to keep an eye on the road if one were without a passenger reading them out!  </p>
<p>We had a late breakfast at Denny's, not our first choice but the only choice on this stretch of highway (towns are invisible from the road), and I enjoyed my plate of yep... eggs, hash browns, whole wheat toast and lots of grape jelly, along with three big mugs of hot tea. </p>
<p>On our way again at 11:30, with Mountain Home being the next town on the way. Nice address to have, wouldn't it be? Reminded me of the John Denver song... </p>
<p>Once again came long stretches of road with fields on both sides, mostly uninhabited by man or animal, but with the occasional lonely farm house on its own. Hard to imagine where the people who live there would pick up bread or milk... </p>
<p>At one point down the road, Bliss was just a mile away and the Sawtooth Mountain Range off in the distance was spectacular. At 12:30 p.m. we witnessed very strange weather patterns... light rain, pouring rain, brilliant sunshine, but with visible dark rain clouds obvious off to our right and left, as though the road had been designed to keep us clear and safe. </p>
<p>At 2:35 we entered Utah where the time changed.. actually 1:35 PST. There was very heavy rain a half hour later but with a spectacular mountain range with snowy caps in the background. We drove into Salt Lake City and since I had never been there drove right downtown to Temple Square to see what we could see. Unfortunately, the Tabernacle was closed for refurbishing but we walked around admiring the flowers and the temple from outside (only Mormon members can go inside), and ending at the Family Research Centre where we spend twenty minutes or so looking up some John Dyments and Amos Rodgers. Found lots of them and also learned that we can get all this same information online from home. Nice folks though everywhere we went in this city. </p>
<p>So, on to dinner before getting on the road again. Doug had been here on business a few times years ago, and clearly remembered a good pizza place he had eaten at twice. He wasn't certain he could find it but once he mentioned good pizza I wasn't willing to settle for anything else. He was quite sure it was on an east-west road, and remembered at one point that he could see a mountain at the end of the street, so we searched up and down a few roads. Some were dismissed as being too residential, some as too wide, and of course the city has grown and changed since he was here which only added to the task. Doug did remember, however, that it was on a south side of a corner, that the door was on the side rather than on the main road and so we continued... and found it! At one point I think that Doug was ready to give up but I encouraged him ... I was ready for pizza! And lo and behold, there it was just as he remembered it. It was called "Litza Pizza" and has been business since the 60's. We shared a garden salad and a medium eight slice pizza, with lots of cheese and a very tasty tomato sauce... all homemade including the dressing on the salad. Cost of dinner with tip and tax was $11.45! Wish we could stop there on the way home but that would take us a few hundred miles out of the way. A couple coming out of the restaurant offered to take a photo of the two of us standing outside (I was taking Doug's) and she mentioned that it wasn't New York pizza but pretty darned good nonetheless; we agreed with her. </p>
<p>I had never seen Salt Lake and was determined to do so; once again it took us a little while to find our way to the southern tip of it, and spent a half hour or so walking around. I expected it to be large and blue but at the section we were at it was somewhat murky with a layer of scummy looking algae on it. Not too impressive at this site but interesting and satisfied my urge to have seen it... took a few photos and set out again. </p>
<p>After all the driving around searching, and sightseeing, it took us longer than we had planned; Doug wants to be in Las Vegas no later than 4 p.m. tomorrow so reminded me that we had many miles to go before we slept. </p>
<p>We left there around 7:30 and drove to Fillmore, Utah, after seeing a lovely and late sunset... at 9:30 p.m. the sky was still steaky with pink but of course by our internal clocks it was still just 8:30. Fillmore was the last little town of any size for another hundred miles; instead of staying at the much-too-basic small trucker's motel we had seen advertised, we crossed to the other side of the highway and found an oasis... a big new Apple Inn, with lots of apple related "clutter", nicely decorated rooms and towels twice as big as the night before for just $56 including breakfast. Watched some tv, read a little and turned out the light.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/from_utah_to_nevada.html">From Utah to Nevada</a></h2>
								<p>After a restless night (the room was too warm and I had had things on my mind... ended up finishing a book by flashlight at 3:30 a.m.), I awoke at 7 a.m. Mountain Time. Took a long hot shower, ate a banana, and watched a little morning TV while Doug showered.</p>
<p>Our stay at the Apple Inn included breakfast, and what a great breakfast it was too. I had a bowl of hot oatmeal, a very small whole wheat bagel with light strawberry cream cheese (a new favourite food), and two glasses of orange juice. Doug had a morning pastry and orange juice, but he too treated himself to a blueberry bagel with the strawberry cream cheese. Waffles and cold cereal were available as well. We saved $10 on breakfast by eating before setting out. </p>
<p>By 8:10, we were in the car, with Doug whistling "On the Road Again". <br />
A perfectly lovely sunny day awaited us, and the truckers, on the road this morning. We were just 260 miles from Las Vegas so there was no problem reaching the city much earlier than Doug had thought we would. </p>
<p>The speed limit was 75 mph again; Doug is going to miss going this speed! We sure do put those miles behind us! Gorgeous scenery again today, although there were much longer strips of flat barren land than yesterday. However, there was a gorgeous fifteen mile stretch of spectacular mountains (the edge of the Grand Canyon) that had me wishing I could snap photos faster than was possible. </p>
<p>Immediately preceding that adventure, we had stopped to take a photo of the "Welcome to Nevada" sign, and neither of us noticed that it actually said "Welcome to Arizona"! A few miles down the road, Doug realized that the mileage markers weren't making sense to him at all... and then, seeing the <strong>actual</strong> Nevada sign, he realized that we hadn't been in Nevada until that point.  </p>
<p>We decided to turn around and take a photo of the Nevada sign, and Doug had a look at the map, showing the tiny corner of land in the southwest corner of what we had thought was Nevada to be actually the northwest corner of Arizona! So we travelled though British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, and finally had arrived in Nevada. </p>
<p>At 12:30, we reached the bright lights and the busy bustling city of Las Vegas. We are staying at the Golden Nugget in the downtown area, not on the strip. The hotel is newly decorated with new carpeting, draperies, wallpaper, etc. We are on the 18th floor of the hotel (in room 1865), a non-smoking floor, and far from the heavy and disgusting fumes of the casino floor. If I didn't like pulling those slot handles as much as I do, I would never agree to step foot in one of them! </p>
<p>Before bringing our bags up from the car, we headed right out to find a luncheon buffet. We strolled down to the Horseshoe Hotel and for less than $7.00 had a very good lunch, if high in carbs... canneloni, plain pasta with alfredo sauce (which was quite a treat for me), corn salad, fried rice, followed by a big plate of big red strawberries (not nearly as good as the ones in Gail's front garden!), pineapple, two different melon slices, and a small but delicious iced brownie with walnuts... yum! I enjoyed my three big cups of hot tea before heading back to the hotel around 2 p.m. </p>
<p>Doug set up the computer with our $12 for 24 hour internet connection while I unpacked and ironed all my blouses and slacks, much needed after five weeks of travelling. </p>
<p>Doug is out for the evening at a night-before-the-meeting gathering, and I have decided to stay in and do some catch up on e-mails, blogs, magazines, etc. My stomach is a bit off and has been since morning... wondering about the water, although Doug is fine. We walked out at 5:30 to stroll the now-cooler streets for a bit, looking for a mail box to no avail. Doug chatted with some people in the hotel lobby first and at 6:15 we went our separate ways. </p>
<p>I wandered into Fitzgerald's first, trying to find a nice friendly nickel slot, to no avail. Decided to go back to our hotel, but since our hotel offers a gold card worth $10 in slot money, I signed up for that first. I wandered around playing some nickel machines for a bit but couldn't find any nickel machines that accepted the card, so chose what turned out to be a nice lucky quarter machine. After winning just enough to keep me going for a half hour I hit one of the bigger combinations... and won $253! </p>
<p>Always nice to walk away with some extra money, and the chit for the money is still in my wallet. I came home and ate a small whole wheat bagel with cream cheese I kept from this morning and then the evening flew by! </p>
<p>Doug has just walked in the door; it's 10:30 p.m., I have answered a few e-mails, read a couple of articles in a magazine, and finished this blog... so goodnight!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/viva_las_vegas.html">Viva Las Vegas!</a></h2>
								<p>I woke at 6 a.m. today; nice to have the computer sitting right here as it gave me something to do without disturbing Doug. After writing a couple of emails I was cold and snuggled in next to Doug for a few minutes. When he got up to check his e-mail at 7:15 I jumped into the shower as we had decided to have a breakfast buffet today. </p>
<p>We ate in the Golden Nugget and had a delicious and most ample start to our day. I had eggs, potatoes, a slice of French toast, and a tiny, but very tasty, cheese blintz followed by a big plate of wonderfully fresh fruit and three cups of hot tea. Doug had an omelette as well. I brought one back with me for a late afternoon snack. </p>
<p>Doug left at 9:15 to register and go to a music store with three other fellows, and I came upstairs to e-mail away. Gail was on Skype so we had a nice little chat, catching up on the past few days. </p>
<p>At noon Doug was back as we had tickets to attend a magic show at 1 p.m. A crowd was waiting downstairs for the busses to the Strip. There were lots of familiar faces... Isobel and Roger, whom we stayed with in England four years ago, Betsy and Chuck, who visited with us a few months ago, Charles from Australia and a couple of local Bay area people too. I had some time to talk with both Betsy and Isobel on the bus, and then with Charles at the table at the show. </p>
<p>The magic show was a delight; I laughed so hard and enjoyed it so much. Doug had seen it not too long ago and was sure I would like it. I certainly did! Max King was charming in a very low-key and casual way and his patter was hilarious and the tricks very clever. We bought his book of one hundred tricks, all to do with the head! for wee Bryn for his birthday. One of them sounds utterly perfect for an eleven year old... "jab a fork in the eye ball".  </p>
<p>We caught a taxi back to the hotel with three others and once again headed off in different directions. I played some nickel machines, with no luck at all today, and so came back to the hotel to get on with my designated chores. Did lots of e-mailing to various folks... getting there slowly, one e-mail at a time. </p>
<p>At 5 p.m. I decided I was hungry and walked along Fremont Street. It was in the throes of preparation for a group wedding tonight... one hundred couples had won the opportunity to be married in Las Vegas. Brides in shorts and casual clothes had been walking around all day with veils on; they had all had their hair done I suppose but were a few hours away from the ceremony. The streets were very busy; I know because I couldn't decide on a place for dinner and walked up and down several times changing my mind about what to eat and where. The smaller places are filled with smokers and the larger restaurants with non-smoking sections were just more food than I wanted to eat on my own. After an hour of indecision I finally decided on a tuna sandwich with fries from a cafe in our hotel, and brought the sandwich up to the room to eat. </p>
<p>Doug came back at 7:30 for an e-mail break and to tell me all about his wonderful buffet dinner; I was more than ready for a cup of tea so back out I went again, to Starbucks for a big cuppa. By this time the crowds had gathered to see what they could of the ceremony. I decided I wasn't going to be able to see a thing, walked further down the street and came to the spot where the couples had lined up for the walk to the square to be married! I stood and watched all hundred of them and honestly wondered how many of them would still be together in a year. I saw them after the ceremony too, with cigarettes hanging out of their mouths, talking on their cell phones, some of them looking as though they were on their way out for a last-minute pizza in very casual clothes, but many with tuxes and elaborate gowns, and lots of family with them as well. It was fun in a very odd and Las Vegas sort of way. </p>
<p>Music was being piped in and it was soooo loud! I felt sorry for the newlyweds having to deal with the noise and the crowds, but lots of them looked very happy and in love, smiling for their family members armed with cameras. Everyone was being taped with TV cameras as well, so I suppose there is a chance that I might see some of it on TV at some point. </p>
<p>Back to the hotel after playing $5 for the day, this time in pennies! I didn't understand how many I was playing at once and it didn't take long to run through them. I sure do miss the fun, old penny slots they had years ago. Some of these have twenty lines! </p>
<p>E-mails, a hot shower to rid myself of the smoke fumes, and some reading time ended my day.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/big_win.html">Big Win!</a></h2>
								<p>... breakfast buffet with Doug</p>
<p>... banana and almonds for lunch </p>
<p>... emailing most of the day</p>
<p>... lovely dinner with a large group of folks from the PEA; sat next to Isobel at dinner. </p>
<p>... Doug signed up for his free $10 card and got an extra one for me somehow... there was a box to mark for "spouse"</p>
<p>... and so off to the slot machines I went with $20 in "free" money and $10 of my own. I played from 8 p.m. until just after midnight (Doug was at the meeting), and playing on two side-by-side machines I went up to $97 and then all the way down to just $13! I was so annoyed with myself, and decided I might as well continue on with that... and walked in the door with $218.75!!!! And what a good time I had doing this... I was up and down for the whole four hours, usually sitting at around $40-$50 so when I hit a bigger jackpot on both machines in total decided it was time to get home to bed. This is my idea of a great time in a gambling city... hours pulling that slot handle, and walking out a winner!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/last_day_in_vegas.html">Last Day in Vegas</a></h2>
								<p>Quick blog tonight; it's bedtime. Day's summary: slept in 'til 9:20 this  morning!!!! Doug had left at 8 a.m. for an early breakfast meeting and I didn't hear him getting ready or leaving. Showered immediately, couldn't get the computer up and running, so went out for a long walk up and down Fremont Street and around a few blocks. It's hot out there! </p>
<p>Back to the room around noon hour, went through a couple of magazines while waiting for Doug to come back for lunch. I was hungry and about to give up on him but phoned Isobel who said the meeting must be running late as she too was waiting. Doug arrived at 12:45 with no interest at all in eating; breakfast had been a very generous buffet, so I left him to the computer and enjoyed a long, slow brunch on my own whilst reading my book. </p>
<p>E-mailed the afternoon away, catching up on lots of long-neglected e-mails. Chatted on Skype with both Gail and Candy; Rick and Candy arrived in Nanaimo today. Gail and Tom had picked them up at 9:30 and they were on the Island by 12:30. It was great to talk with them both, and Candy and I chatted for a while when Gail went off to get dinner for the guys. </p>
<p>Doug had left at 5:45 but came up to say that if I could dress quickly I could join them for dinner tonight; someone had an extra ticket! I said goodbye to Candy and ten minutes later was out the door with Doug. Lovely to have the chance to talk with Betsy, Isobel, and Lynette too. Dinner was delicious... cream of asparagus soup (I had two small bowls), a green salad, followed by baked halibut topped with a really tasty pesto crust, potato, and green beans. Dessert was a mocha cheesecake and I had a nice big pot of tea as well. </p>
<p>We moved to another room set up as a theatre and watched a terrific performance by members of the PEA group... mind reading, of course, a comedian in the guise of a New Jersey mafia member, a terrific Canadian couple who are also mind readers, and a couple of others. Siegfried was in the audience, and then took part in the last act of the evening by Joe Atmore, a fellow who lives in the Bay area whom I have met before. </p>
<p>We took a few photos of some of these people we spent time with, and here I sit... writing my last blog of this trip. It's 12:15 and time for bed.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/pool_time_at_nanas_and_grandpa.html">Pool Time at Nana's and Grandpa's!</a></h2>
								<p>What a busy day it was today, and just the day I needed. I had both Amelia and Riku with me for hours which was just lovely. I slept in until almost 8 a.m., dashed into the shower, and came downstairs in time to make arrangements to pick Riku up at 9:30 so that he could go with me to the airport with Grandpa for Doug's 11 a.m. flight to New Jersey. </p>
<p>Riku decided his mommy should come with us too which worked out perfectly; we had decided to go to Costco today anyway, so instead of coming home, the three of us went off to Trader Joe's for some groceries, biding our time there until Costco opened at 11 a.m. Riku played and squealed happily with a balloon he found at the Nordstrom Rack, where we put in another fifteen minutes once we were done at Trader Joe's. The string on the balloon was just long enough that Riku could let it go and know that either his Mom or I would get it back for him. </p>
<p>We dropped Akane off at home after our Costco run. Riku was ready for his lunch despite all the toast samples he ate at Costco; the kind woman there told me to take as many as he wanted and he wanted a lot! I made him a noodly tofu soup at home, with sauteed mushrooms and fresh tomatoes on the side. He ate it all up and then it was nap time. He protested for a minute until we got back to the routine... the ocean sound turned on, his monkey, two dogs and the mouse snuggled in beside him, and his choice of blankets to lie on and cover him. Ten minutes later Riku was sound asleep. </p>
<p>Susan arrived with Amelia just a few minutes later; we shut the hallway doors and got busy working in the garden, which we had planned the night before. Susan had kindly stopped and chose a wading pool for me (part of my Las Vegas winnings are for this) and a pump. We also ate delicious cheese, avocado, lettuce, sprout and onion sandwiches she had picked up along with two types of wonderful cookies. </p>
<p>Riku woke after just an hour and helped us pump it up, and the children watched it filling with water. While this was going on he and Amelia swept away with the new child-size brooms I had bought for them before I left for Japan. The two of them were so cute together, putting weeds in the bag and sweeping before going into the cool pool (we did add hot water to it, a lot of hot water!). </p>
<p>It was a hit! Amelia crawled in and out of it, shivering away, and choosing not to be dressed, because of course she wanted the freedom to go back in when she got tired of sitting bundled up in a towel on the chair. Riku sat in it for ages, playing quietly away with some floating toys and finally coming out when I insisted, as he sat looking so obviously cold. Brr! He snuggled up against me with a towel warm from the dryer wrapped around him, and kissed me twice near my shoulder as he snuggled. He has never done that before with me, just kissed impulsively, and it was the sweetest thing. </p>
<p>Amelia on the other hand, is, as Susan puts it, a real kissing and hugging bear! And she is; she will just come up for a kiss several times an hour and gives the biggest hugs I have ever had from a child.  The yard looks so much better and soon I or we will plant the flowers that Susan also brought over with her. Now that some of the weeds are gone there is an obvious place for the bright tiny purple flowers and the others shall go in pots. The garden looked so horrible after six weeks of neglect, except for watering which Doug and Bryn took care of. </p>
<p>Susan and Amelia left about 5:45. Riku and I went upstairs for a few minutes but he decided he wanted to draw. We had just started that when Bryn walked in to take him home. Riku wasn't quite ready to be whisked away so we compromised by having me walk him home instead. This did the trick and we meandered home, stopping to look at a few interesting things along the way. He wanted me to stay for a bit so I sat with him while he ate the dinner Akane had ready for him, and then we had some playing time in his room before it was time for me to leave. </p>
<p>I was home by 7:30, not feeling energetic enough to get to work on the boxes and suitcases awaiting me, so I worked on some emails, ate a bit of dinner, and headed up for bed at 9:15 p.m. Lights out at 11, after tidying up a bit in the bedroom and reading for a bit.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/amelias_first_sleepover.html">Amelia's First Sleepover</a></h2>
								<p>Comng downstairs without showering is not a good idea anymore; I just lounge around as though there isn't a thing to do! Gail and I msn'd by typing for a bit and then I called Candy at Gail's, as Skype isn't working for me and I wanted to say hello. I read a bit of the paper, and took my time deciding what if anything I should have for breakfast... and finally got upstairs and under the wate, much later than I had planned! </p>
<p>Susan and I were in touch to decide whether Amelia was coming over to me, or whether I was going to go to her house. Amelia made the decision easy for us, as she fell asleep on her walk with Susan, so the plan was for me to go to Ashbury Street. All well and good, until I realized I couldn't find my car keys. I searched high and low and think one of the two children must have gotten hold of them yesterday; they are no doubt tucked away somewhere! </p>
<p>I hopped in a cab as Susan had a massage appointment, giving her barely enough time to make it to the Kabuki. By this time Amelia was in her high chair having lunch and greeted me with her big enthusiastic "Hi Nana!". We took our time over her lunch and I ate the other half of her burrito; Susan had bought me a whole one, but half was all I needed, Amelia and I sat and read in the living room while I had a nice hot cup of tea. </p>
<p><br />
After that it was time for some outdoor play; I told Amelia she could take her baby stroller or her shopping cart with her and she chose the cart. After walking around the Panhandle a bit, I ended up carrying the cart into the playground, where it was a massive hit with all the other children there. Amelia wasn't happy to see someone else pushing it while she was on the swing, but finally decided it was fine. She was all too happy to use another little girl's doll stroller while her buggy was in high demand with the others.</p>
<p>Amelia scared the dickens out of me by grabbing hold of an overhead bar, just over the slide, and swinging very high with her feet up close to her bottom! She is such a strong little girl! and is obviously more comfortable with her athletic abilities than I am. I realized soon though that she was in full control, but it was still a little nerve-wracking! </p>
<p>We arrived home just a few minutes before Susan did, bearing sunflowers and lime tarts for me. I had mentioned a couple of weeks ago via email that it would be fun if Amelia could sleep over sometime. Susan and Kevin were all for it, and since Doug is away in New Jersey on business tonight and tomorrow, this seemed the perfect time. We aren't sure how it would go, so it is best that Doug not be kept awake much of the night if Amelia really needed her mommy. </p>
<p>Susan drove us home and left us about 5:30 p.m. Amelia had a hard time keeping her eyes open by the time we were almost home, but I sat in the back seat with her to encourage her to stay awake. She slept only an hour today and will be ready for an earlier night this way. This is Susan's first night away from Amelia ever, so it was no doubt a little hard for her to walk away.</p>
<p>The rest of the evening passed very quickly; dinner time first (Amelia ate a great dinner... all her spinach and rice, all of her macaroni and cheese, some of her tofu and noodles, and all of her fruit bowl... cherries, mango, green grapes, banana and strawberries!), then bath time with Robin, lotion and pj's (Amelia likes to help rub the lotion on her tummy and arms), teeth brushing (she is a great little spitter!), and finally story time. </p>
<p>There were a few mandatory tears; I held her for a few minutes but then lay her down, stroking her forehead. I went in with her to Riku's room at 7:30 and walked out at 7:50! No one was more amazed than I was; I did phone Susan to tell her the good news. </p>
<p>Amelia awakened twice after that during the next two hours... once because the phone kept ringing and ringing and she was totally aware of it, and once to call out for her Mom. I told her that it was tuck-in time, that she was to stay in bed, and would see her mommy tomorrow. And she did it all... stayed in bed, stopped crying and went to sleep clutching her tiny moose for comfort. </p>
<p>I sat and read after cleaning the kitchen, read a few emails and went off to bed with her at 10:30 p.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/a_very_very_busy_day.html">A Very Very Busy Day!</a></h2>
								<p>What a very successful first night away from home for Amelia! Except for one tiny calling out for her Mommy during the night Amelia slept right through until 7:20. I was lying next to her waiting for her eyes to open. She was so sweet; gave me a big smile, leaned over for a big kiss, and sat up ready for her day. It could not have been a better night; I immediately left Susan an email, but then phoned her after seeing her message saying she was awake and headed for the shower half an hour earlier. Unfortunately, Susan's sleep was not quite as successful as Amelia's as she is so used to waking often during the night. One day... however, she and Kevin got to watch a whole movie at home, uninterrupted, had a quiet dinner, although the house seemed awfully quiet to them!, and enjoyed their evening together. </p>
<p>Amelia played in the bathroom with some wooden toys while I showered and then we went down to dress her for this cool and overcast day. Too bad, as the pool is filled waiting for sunshine. Bryn dropped Riku off just after 8:30 and we sat down for breakfast a little while after that. They both had strawberries and toast, and Amelia had a yogurt too. Riku was a little tired, up too late last night, so Bryn wasn't sure if he would eat much or be inclined to play happily with Amelia, but they had a great time together. </p>
<p>Seeing that little blonde and Riku's dark head together is the sweetest thing. He is taller and stockier than Amelia but she takes the lead in giving him big bear hugs, not always welcomed!, and many kisses too, which he seems just fine with. I think it is the Nelson hold that he objects too, with the back of his shirt being held firmly while she wrestles him down for the hug that bothers him the most! Yes, a little refereeing is necessary at times. She is not being mean to him, just a little more assertive that young Riku is used to at this stage of his life. </p>
<p>We had a busy morning; they drew at the table, played side by side in the sink, sharing their pouring containers and little cups, we sat and read on the sofa, and they sat on Riku's bed with all of his cars spread out, playing very nicely indeed with those too. </p>
<p>Riku walked up and down the stairs to our room many times today by holding on to the railing only. Up to now he has always crawled down backwards, which is a much more comfortable position for me to handle, watching him! But he is growing up I suppose and he is a very cautious little boy; I still want to be there when he is doing this though and so far, so good. No doubt Amelia will be barrelling down in no time, adding grey hairs to my head; the child has no fear. Egad! </p>
<p>Susan arrived at 11:30 a.m. with a little fellow Sylvan, whom she is babysitting today for a neighbour. He is very cute; big blue eyes with some green in the centre and a smile that spreads and spreads. Riku was quite taken with him, and gave him lots of little hugs and attention... handing him a rattle or shaking it for him, just as he did for his cousin Haruka in Japan. Amelia was very maternal with him too, leaning on him to give him kisses and then gently hugging him when he protested with the hugs. </p>
<p>Well, I won't detail our day and how busy we were... it was just crazy at times, with both Sylvan and Amelia crying, both needing their naps, and Sylvan fussing each time he was put down while Susan and I got lunch ready for them. How one little person can throw a whole routine off is just amazing, but as Susan said, we didn't adjust slowly over the past seven months of his life and that makes a big difference. We were both very happy to have the extra set of hands around! </p>
<p>Susan took Sylvan in a front baby carrier and Amelia in her stroller for a walk in the drizzle. Riku was down for his nap at 1 p.m. and slept until 2:15. He was ready for some quiet time with his Nana, and we sat on the bed reading story after story until he had has his share of me. Snack time... grapes and strawberries with some cheese and toast. </p>
<p>The house was busy once again with snacks for Amelia and filling up Sylvan who just ate and ate and ate... applesauce, carrots, squash and his bottle. Bryn and Kevin both called to see how things were going and we were delighted to hear they are both planning on being home a little earlier tonight. </p>
<p>Bryn asked if I would babysit Riku tonight while they went out to use a birthday gift certificate from us; I was more than happy to do so, as it gave me a little more time with Riku. We said goodbye to Amelia, Susan, and Sylvan at 5:30, and at 6 p.m. Bryn picked us up for the drive home (still raining). </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn left almost immediately so Riku and I got busy making a spinach and cheese omelette for him, with a whole slice of toast and some fresh tomatoes. He had strawberry sorbet for dessert and we talked about the gelato we had in Japan. </p>
<p>Riku then helped me with the dishes and he really helped! He did the washing and just needed a little supervision with the sponge on the plates but he rinsed the dishes under the tap as though he's been doing it for ages. He has been helping, I know, but he is a quick learner, taking it all very seriously. </p>
<p>Tub time after that; Riku wanted all of his tub toys, which was fine with me. I taught him how to fill a little whale which then meant he could aim it to squirt a long stream of water right at me! He laughed and laughed and so did I; he is so funny now as he will comment on what we are doing... "Riku squirting Nana! Nana laughing! Funny!"</p>
<p>The other day he was talking with wee Bryn on the phone; Bryn must have said something funny to Riku, as he laughed, and then told Bryn "Riku laughing"! as though Bryn wouldn't know that. </p>
<p>He also told me that there was a whale in Nana's yard too, which there is, of course, as the whale pool is taking up a big space in it now. He is quite the little conversationalist these days and it's such fun. </p>
<p>I washed his hair and he then washed his baby's hair, telling her "stay calm, stay calm" (first time I have heard this from him) or "it's okay". Riku is a little nervous about getting water in his eyes, and this is his way of letting us know to be very careful, although it has been a long time since he fussed while I washed his hair. In Japan I washed it in the kitchen sink while he lay flat on the counter; this worked well too and is how I used to wash his daddy's hair.  </p>
<p>The usual nighttime routine followed... a big snuggle with the towel wrapped around him, and then keeping his upper body covered while applying lotion to the lower half (I don't like being chilled after my shower so just assume he doesn't either), then pj's, teeth (with some valiant spitting attempts), and then story time... "Walter the Lazy Mouse" tonight; we just went through each page while Riku commented on what was happening. We also talked about going to the park tomorrow afternoon if it isn't raining, although Bryn told me Riku's Japanese nanny will take him in the morning if the weather allows it. </p>
<p>Riku took a little longer to settle tonight; twenty minutes instead of the usual ten, but I could see he was working towards drifting off and he did a great job. </p>
<p>I put on the kettle for hot water, instead of tea, and sat drinking it while catching up on yesterday's and starting today's blog. Bryn insisted on driving me home, even though it wasn't raining and I was looking forward to the short walk; I wasn't out all day today or yesterday for any exercise at all... but I was escorted home and am now off to bed.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/ah_the_end_of_my_first_week_at.html">Ah, The End of My First Week at Home</a></h2>
								<p>And how the five days did fly by! It doesn't seem quite possible that I have been home for so long as I am still catching up after six weeks away... lots of paper work, laundry, housework, and emails. Mostly though I have been spending as much time as possible with Amelia and Riku, which is of course why the time has flown by. </p>
<p>I slept in until 7:10 this morning and popped right into the shower. Finally started getting some things done around the house but did take a break and catch up on the last couple of days of the local paper, over a big cup of hot chocolate. </p>
<p>Susan came over at 10:45 with Amelia, who had fallen asleep in the car. She was successfully transferred to her big comfy stroller, and she and I went off for what turned out to be a two and a half hour nap for Amelia. It was a gorgeous day, sunny and a bit breezy, perfect for a long walk. </p>
<p>Doug took the local bus from the airport and was home when Amelia woke up at 1:15. She was a happy girl to see Doug and had her arms wrapped around his neck from the time he picked her up out of the stroller until they were upstairs and taking off her jacket. Lunch time followed immediately and Amelia was a hungry girl once more. We had such fun at the table; she and Doug made horse sounds and Amelia flipped through some cards of paintings, pointing all the familiar things she spotted. Her newest "thing" since I came home is her very sweet "uh huh" when you ask her something. The occasionaly "no" gets in there but far more "uh huhs". It's so very cute. Even when Amelia says no she often means "yes" but I'm sure that won't last long. Susan came in just as she was finishing up a big portion of fresh fruit, and we chatted for a bit before they left for the playground. </p>
<p>I was hoping to hear from Akane during the afternoon, so that I could take Riku for a walk or have some time in the yard with me. While I was waiting, I went upstairs with a pot of tea (Susan bought me a box of English tea today!) and a Joseph Schmidt truffle, also from Susan. Delish'! I sat and enjoyed some taped Oprah's from late May, feeling that I was getting yet another chore done, a very relaxing chore at that. </p>
<p>Doug and I shared a store bought pizza, doctored up with spinach, mushrooms, fresh tomatoes, oregano, and Buffalo mozzarella cheese, along with the ever-present plate of carrot and celery sticks, our old standby vegies. </p>
<p>Before going back up to finish the last of the Oprah's on one tape, I took up all the mail from the past six weeks and did a big sort while sitting there. There was a huge stack so it was great to get rid of all that excess paper; now for the filing and bill-paying.</p>
<p>Riku called as I sat there; they had been over to Susan, Kevin's and Amelia's for some of the evening and Riku told me all about it. Amelia shared her toys with him, and he played with her stroller and buggy, or so he claimed. It was lovely to hear his voice; I am still going through withdrawal symptoms after those three solid weeks in Japan. Perhaps I will see him tomorrow. </p>
<p>Put another load of laundry in before heading up to bed; not many emails today which should be a relief but made me feel a little lonely too. Gail, Tom, Rick, and Candy are in Seattle for three days and I didn't manage to connect with Caillie or any of the other children either. Perhaps tomorrow... </p>
<p>Bedtime... 10:30. Night night.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/the_flashlight_isnt_the_only_t.html">The Flashlight Isn't the Only Thing Beaming!</a></h2>
								<p>A lazy Saturday, the first in six weeks at home! I slept in for a bit today, just enjoying the freedom to do so. It's my favourite way to start the day, and then I was ready to get up and on with it. I did laze about though in my nightie until I talked with Caillie and Bryant, as planned yesterday. </p>
<p>Caillie is changing... she used to love to chat on the phone many years ago, but for the past two or more years she has been in a big hurry to get on with other things. But today we just chatted away and it was such a pleasure. I mentioned this to her and her response was "Well, I guess I am just growing up"! I guess she is and I am glad. </p>
<p>Bryant has impetigo and so his 10th birthday party for friends was cancelled today, postponed until July. He didn't sound too sad though although was not happy with the big red crusty sores on his face. He is hoping they will be gone by Monday when he has to return to school but he didn't sound too hopeful that they would be. They were all off to a movie, except for Caillie, who is attending a birthday party for an 11 year old! </p>
<p>I started the laundry and answered a few emails, ate, and read the paper. Bryn lost his car key... seems to be running in the family this week as I lost mine on Tuesday... so Doug went over with it. We had lunch at home and then went off to a double feature movie at the Four Star Cinema, my first movie in seven weeks or more. It was a treat for sure. I do love to sit in a dark theatre and not think about all the other things I should be doing! The second film, a French film ("Look at Me") made by a Canadian, was very well acted and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The first was an American film called "The Crash"; it certainly kept me on the edge of my seat and I enjoyed it as well. </p>
<p>We stopped at the grocery store on the way home, checked out a street fair for fifteen minutes, and headed home for dinner at 6:30... corn on the cob, fresh tomatoes, and a "Philly Cheesesteak" burger, vegie of course. It was all good and hit the spot. </p>
<p>I was feeling a little low, having not seen Riku today or yesterday (I am going through withdrawal still after all our time together in Japan) when the doorbell rang and I was greeted with that happy little face of his. Bryn was over with the laundry and some time for us with Riku while he and Akane went to Rainbow for groceries. Bryn put in a load of laundry and then we sat and chatted about Riku going to summer school, while Riku drew with his new pens from Japan. This time with Riku was just what I needed! That smiling face never fails to cheer me up. </p>
<p>We went upstairs and built a bridge and Riku filled up one of the Lego platforms with lots of Lego blocks. He hadn't eaten much dinner at home so I made him a bowl of four-grain cereal with fresh strawberries, a piece of toast, and when Grandpa ate some custard with strawberries Riku kept right up with him, spooning his all up too! </p>
<p>We had only an hour or so alone together and of course that time flew by. Bryn came by to pick him up about 9 p.m. (he had napped late today) and suggested that we walk Riku home to give him a little extra time and exercise too. I talked Doug into coming too, which was great, as he thought to take along a flashlight with us; it was dark but with a big moon and some stars shining as well. He wanted Doug to carry him, which meant that he could shine the flashlight up high into the trees, onto the sidewalk and our shadows from his perch in Grandpa's arms, onto cars, and signs... what a great time he had. Doug commented while we were walking that the flashlight wasn't the only thing beaming, and it sure wasn't! Riku was one big smiling face from the time we left our house until we got to his house. The lights are out on the top two floors there right now and so the big ending to his day was lighting our way up the stairs. He said goodnight to us happily and we were on our way home, leaving him with his mommy.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/happy_fathers_day.html">Happy Father's Day!</a></h2>
								<p>Woke up at 7:10 to a bright and sunny Father's Day morning. Doug showered immediately after me, as the plan for today was to go to Hampshire Street early for breakfast and play time with Riku. He slept until after 7:30 this morning and we walked over at 8:30. </p>
<p>Riku was very happy to have us there, and he looked so cute in his light-coloured, soft, summer pj's! We immediately went to the living room for some sofa time, chatting with him and looking at some books.</p>
<p> Bryn came in with a homemade car for Doug, as well as some  delicious tiny chocolates, and a gift certificate to see a couple of movies. Perfect, as we have decided to rent movies for the next while. </p>
<p>We also played in Riku's room with his cars until Bryn had breakfast prepared... perfect lightly scrambled eggs, "bacon", delicious home fries (Bryn's own recipe with a touch of maple syrup and hot sauce added), Acme's Levain Sourdough, toasted, and hot tea. Riku sat on my lap and enjoyed his breakfast too, along with a glass of "superfood". It was a relaxing Sunday breakfast until...  </p>
<p>anxious to get back to playing as soon as he was finished, Riku and Doug went into the bedroom to build a fantastic robot. Bryn and I cleaned the kitchen while Akane showered. Bryn had suggested a trip to Muir Woods for a couple of hours. Doug was keen, as was I. I thought I hadn't been before but Kelly reminded me later that she and I had taken wee Bryn there many years ago. </p>
<p>We left around 11 a.m. and managed to beat the heavier crowds we encountered on the way home. Riku had a forty-five minute nap on the way and woke up looking forward to seeing the "big trees" he had seen a few weeks ago with his Dad, Kevin, and Amelia. We had a lovely slow stroll amongst the gorgeous tall California Redwoods; Riku stopped to collect sticks, peer over bridges, throw and drop sticks into a rippling creek, and just generally investigating anything that caught his interest. He touched a banana slug, and saw a busy grey squirrel moving about not too far from him in a tree. Doug and I walked on our own to "Cypress Grove"  and then met up with Bryn, Akane, and Riku on our walk back. It was a perfect day for this walk... sunny, but cool under the canopy of trees, and just a very restful kind of afternoon. </p>
<p>Back in the car at 3:15, we all had some snacks. Riku ate a rice cake, a few cheese bites, and cherries and grapes. I started saying some nursery rhymes to him, then sang a few favourite songs "Here We Go Gathering Nuts in May", and "Down at the Station" at which point Bryn joined in with the ones he knew too... Raffi and "Old MacDonald" ("song about chickens" asked Riku) and then finally Doug joined in too from the driver's seat with "Mares Eat Oats... " and others his Mom sang to him. It was a fun trip back but Riku was fading a bit right at the end, in need of a toes-up. We dropped them off at 3:45 p.m. after driving by "Little Angels", the Japanese daycare centre where Riku might spend six weeks this summer. He cried when we left him, which is always sad, but I hope the little nap with his Dad was all he needed. </p>
<p>Kelly called to say "Happy Father's Day" to Doug just the minute we walked in the door, although we had time for a long conversation before I passed the phone over to Doug. It's not often I get to talk with my daughter these days, and I was in Japan on Mother's Day. Doug also took time to show me the photos I took today; lots of good ones! </p>
<p>Doug drove off at 5:30 for his two day class away in Pleasanton, in the East Bay. I finished off the laundry, and then sat and worked away at my huge inbox of emails. Susan called and we chatted for a bit; it was a welcome break from sitting here! Doug also called on Skype; he got the class set up and had dinner at Chili's... a seafood burrito which he said was excellent. </p>
<p>Now 10:30 p.m. and I am on my way upstairs to bed, with a stiff neck! ... </p>
<p>p.s. Bryn has taught Riku to say "What the heck?" and it is so funny to hear him say it, with just the right attitude and inflection in his voice.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/what_a_wonderful_day.html">What a Wonderful Day!</a></h2>
								<p>Ah, I slept until 8:20 a.m., checked my email, took a shower, ate a small breakfast of toast and cheese, enjoyed my big mug (made by Caillie for me) of perfect hot chocolate, and headed out the door for a nice long walk with Amelia. It was already sunny with blue skies when I left the house; Kevin had kindly dropped off "Sammy"... the red Honda, for me to use until Doug returns.</p>
<p>I found Susan and Amelia in the playground across the street from their house. Amelia spotted me from the top of the winding slide, gave me that big Amelia smile and scooted down the slide to greet me. We stayed on with Susan for another half hour or so, and at 11 a.m. Amelia and I set out for our walk. It was a little breezy, just the perfect weather for pushing the stroller. Amelia was ready for her nap and was asleep before we reached the end of the Panhandle. </p>
<p>Instead of walking around Stow Lake, our usual destination, I decided to walk to the big lake at the far end of the park. Too often there are people talking loudly around our favourite lake and I wanted Amelia to have a nice long sleep. She slept for an hour and twenty minutes, and would have slept longer except for a very loud gull, complaining when the man feeding him stopped. Amelia did doze off a bit more on the way home and was her happy and hungry self when we walked in the door at 1:30 p.m. </p>
<p>Susan had her lunch all ready, of course, and I stayed on for a few minutes amazed at how many different foods Amelia will eat... whole beans... kidney beans in Kevin's homemade chili today, pinto and black beans yesterday. Bryn told me she ate quite a spicy curry one night too! </p>
<p>Home for lunch for me... a big green salad with a can of flaked tuna in it, followed by a big cup of tea. I called Akane at 3:15, hoping to get Riku just up from his nap for a trip to the playground, but there was no answer; I sent Akane an email letting her know I would be happy to walk him over and have her join us as it is such a beautiful day. While waiting, I worked on my emails for a bit, writing to Carol, Don, Glenn, and Judith. </p>
<p>I was just heading upstairs with the ironing board to get at Riku's little shirts (I do love ironing these!) when Sheldon called. His email server hasn't been accepting my emails and he wondered what was up; we also caught up on the family news... Don's new job, which he hadn't heard about, Harry serving in the Middle East, etc. and had a nice long talk. It's been a while since we had time to touch base. </p>
<p>I had told Susan this afternoon that I would be happy to either babysit Amelia at their place tonight, or have her over here for another sleepover. I left it in her court, and she called to say that she had packed up and was heading for our playground. At 5 p.m. Bryn let me know that Akane was up, so I called and said I would be right over. Riku and Akane were downstairs waiting for me, Riku with big yellow pail and some shovels in hand.</p>
<p>Lots of plans made... Bryn and Kevin were meeting us at the playground at 6:15, Akane may join us, and Susan would be there after picking up a few groceries. </p>
<p>Riku and I were sitting side my side, with our sandals off, when I spotted Yvonne and Diego... old friends of Kevin's. We had attended Diego's first birthday party in the spring; Yvonne is such a lovely vibrant young woman and it is always a treat to run into her! Diego is taller and slimmer than when I lost saw him and Yvonne is pregnant and due January 25, but is not showing yet. </p>
<p>She was very pleased to hear that Akane, Bryn, Kevin, Susan, and Amelia too would be there soon! Alas, things did not go as planned. Akane did arrive at 6:10; Amelia, however, was too close to being asleep in the car, so Susan brought her right here to give her her dinner. Bryn was chatting with someone at the office and so he and Kevin got there later than they planned to, and so they all missed not only Yvonne and Diego but Kevin's friend, Troy, the dad and husband as well. </p>
<p>Riku had a grand time playing in the sandbox and moving from one to another, playing with all the various toys that the moms are always happy to share. One mom told me about a free music group that meets at the top of Potrero Hill on Fridays so that might be something I could do with Riku this week. </p>
<p>Riku has been accepted into a Japanese summer daycare group, and starts on Monday. He will be there for five weeks, five days a week from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m. I am going to miss my two full days a week with him for sure. It will be impossible to fit in all of our favourite things to do on less than half days, but he will be free all of August. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn are hoping there will be a place for him there in September if he is part of this group, and I am sure Riku will so enjoy having so many children to play with. He is such a socialble little boy and thrives on lots of activity and good people in his life. </p>
<p>Riku gave Kevin such a BIG hug when he saw him; it was really sweet to see. Much to my surprise he was ready to walk home with Kevin and me, while Bryn and Akane drove. I put him into a construction vehicle and Kevin took a few photos of him, beaming away. Riku wanted to be carried the last couple of blocks home, and kissed my shoulder and my cheek as I carried him. Breaks my heart, he does!... but in a good way. </p>
<p>Arrived at home at 7:15! Susan had fed Amelia and had her in the tub, two things I was hoping to do for Susan on this overnight visit of Amelia's! I warmed her towel for her though, and gave her a little massage with the lotion, which she really enjoys, sat her on the toilet, Kevin put her into her jammies, and we showed her mom and dad how well she spits when she brushes her teeth. </p>
<p>Amelia gave big hugs to her mom and dad (who are going home to eat some fondue and watch a movie they started last night), waved merrily at them through the front window, while standing on the table, and off we went immediately to Riku's room for stories. </p>
<p>Suddenly it dawned on Amelia what was going on, but after the tiniest bit of whimpering for her mommy, she snuggled into my lap and we read two stories... "The Very Quiet Cricket" and a barnyard animal book. I lay beside her for just a few moments, singing very very quietly to her so that she had to listen very carefully to "You're My Honeybunch..." and "Rock-a-Bye Baby"... and stroking her hair. I think she was asleep in less than five minutes. </p>
<p>Oh, just as Susan and Kevin were about to leave, Glenna called with the news that she is a grandmother to a little girl! Sharif and his wife are the parents of Jasmine, born last Thursday, at seven pounds and 21" in length! They drove to Toronto to see her; Sharif is over the moon, reports his mom, and tomorrow night Glenna is on her way to Paris with Mostafa. If we don't manage to talk more tomorrow we shall catch up in ten days. How exciting this news is! </p>
<p>I made myself a delicious bowl of fruit and yogurt for me dinner; it was too late for anything heavier and really hit the spot. Susan had brought over some lovely organic apricots which were perfect with the strawberries and bananas I had planned to eat. </p>
<p>Amelia report... awake for less than one minute at 9 p.m. I told her it was still sleepy time and that she was to hold the dog and go back to sleep. This happened at 10 p.m. too and worked like a charm once again... wow! I'm off to wash and get into my pj's just in case I get to bed a little earlier than I plan to, but so far so good. This is just such fun... it's something I have looked forward to. I get to see that first big smile of the day and all those Amelia "hi!"s. </p>
<p>Riku will be joining us for playtime early tomorrow too... can't wait!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/garden_day.html">Garden Day</a></h2>
								<p>My day started off with a big Amelia smile at 6:35 a.m. I think she would have slept longer, but I rolled over and did a big stretch automatically and those big blue eyes popped open. Amelia lay quietly for a few minutes, smiling and kissing me, until I told her it was wake-up time. Then off we went for our day! </p>
<p>First a diaper change after sitting on the toilet. Amelia is quite happy to try the potty and is very often successful too. I was expecting Riku early so popped right into the shower while Amelia played with the farm and animals. The minute the shower stopped I heard "hiiii!" from my little roommate, and then turned on the tv while I dried my hair; this way I could make sure she stayed upstairs and not have to listen to my too-loud dryer. </p>
<p>Amelia had some toast and juice while waiting for Riku to come over; Kevin dropped in on his way to work with Bryn, while dropping Riku off, but both children just headed up the stairs the minute Riku walked in. Bye dads! </p>
<p>What a time these two had today. It is such fun to watch them interacting; they sat drawing at the table after eating cereal and nuts, then sat on the bed playing with a basket of stones and all of the cars!, and we read a couple of books on the sofa for a little quiet time too. In between all of this, they were chasing each other around the house, Amelia got lots of bear hugs in, and they went up and down the stairs to our bedroom. They are both cautious but I am still nervous with the coming down, especially since Riku is now walking down and Amelia would be right behind him doing the same... scary for me! </p>
<p>Susan came by at 11 a.m. and found us in the garden sweeping and cleaning up a little more. We all kept busy out there for quite a long time, with breaks for snacks for the children... bananas, yogurt, more juice, and some berries. By noon hour it was obvious that they both needed their naps; Susan and Amelia went off for a walk while I tried to settle Riku into his bed. However, the fates were against me... the phone rang too often, the doorbell rang, and so I decided that Riku would nap in the stroller today. He was asleep before we got to the end of the hospital, about five minutes away! </p>
<p>It was a hot day today and I was dressed too warmly, with heavier slacks than I needed. Riku napped for only an hour, but I was forty-five minutes away from home when he woke up. He should have slept longer but something disturbed him and he decided that was enough. </p>
<p>Amelia slept for two and a half hours! Susan had picked up burritos for our lunch; I wasn't hungry until she heated up half for me, as much as I felt I should eat. I made tea, and took a cup out to Susan who was back working in the garden. By the time 6 p.m. came, my garden looked just amazing, thanks to her very hard laborious work! I had a much easier time tending to the children; they were "helping" too and often had to be distracted from not taking the dirt out of the pots Susan was planting! I got to read some stories, take photos of them rough-housing on the bed like I have never ever seen them do. It was just hilarious and I was sure someone was going to get hurt. Riku did.. he bumped his mouth into Amelia's head, threw his arms around me and cried, and stopped within a minute. Then Amelia threw her arms around me! and pretended to cry. What an actress we have on our hands; it was the funniest thing. </p>
<p>Bryn and Kevin arrived at 6:15 and the garden was looking so amazing! I have purple lobelia in a boring corner at the front of the garden, near the dining area window, and three pots of mixed flowers in various containers... out with the old, in with the new ... geraniums, lobelia, and some yellow mums. Lovely! Susan did so much weeding, a job I detest, but am determined to keep up with now that it looks so good. </p>
<p>At 7 p.m. everyone left for home, Susan needing a long hot soak, and both children tired from their busy days and all the fresh air and exercise. Doug had the other half of my burrito for dinner, so I didn't even have to cook. Worked on emails, got them down to under 20, and then went up with Doug to watch a taped show together. </p>
<p>About 8 p.m. Riku called to say goodnight to me. It was very sweet; I said "goodnight, honey" and he said "goodnight honey" to me! We had quite a nice little conversation too. </p>
<p>Bryn also called a bit later to say that he was filling out a form for Riku's daycare next week and had to describe Riku in a few words; he decided on: friendly, cautious, sociable, and gentle. That's our boy in a nutshell!  </p>
<p>Lights out at 11:30</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/an_ocean_beach_afternoon.html">An Ocean Beach Afternoon</a></h2>
								<p>I could have slept in today, or stayed in bed reading, as Doug is away, but instead I got up at 6 a.m. and got started with my day. I managed to get so many emails written and am happy to report that I am down to just twenty emails, after starting at over 200 when I arrived home nine days ago. Some of them had been answered while I was away but I wrote the hardest ones of all this morning... the ones that have been waiting for an answer for up to six months or more! I will be so happy when I have them all answered and can get back to answering emails when they are less than a week old! </p>
<p>Since Riku is starting school next week, I can't bear the thought of missing out on our full days together. I made plans with Akane last night to pick Riku up at 11 a.m. today and I was there right on the nose. That beaming little face of his lights up my day; he likes to hold hands almost the whole way home now. We did stop to say hello to Lily at the dry cleaner's but someone else was there and told us that Lily is sick right now. Riku hasn't seen her since we got back from Japan and I could see he was a little disappointed. As always, we took our time walking back here, so that Riku could explore anything and everything that interests him... the ladder at the "burned" house, the window truck outside the new house being built on the next block, and any dog or cat who happens by. </p>
<p>Today was a little off track as Riku wasn't hungry for a late breakfast or an early lunch today. Akane says his appetite has slowed down a bit, and it's true that he isn't quite so eager to sit and eat right now. We waited until 1 p.m. and then he ate well, but still in smaller quantities than has been true for the last month or more. He was also tired though, which contributes to this, so I packed up for our anticipated trip to Ocean Beach, which I had promised him would happen today. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep before I drove ten blocks; I drove right to Ocean Beach, found a quiet parking spot, pulled out my book, rolled down the windows and sat there for another hour and forty-minutes while Riku napped. He woke up very briefly at one point, so I drove down the "Great Highway" for five minutes and returned to our spot, reading and dozing off a bit myself. The sun was warm and just right for a little snoozing. </p>
<p>Susan and Amelia pulled up beside us before Riku woke up; Amelia had had a two and a half hour nap earlier in her stroller so they went off to buy us a cold drink. By the time they returned, Riku and I were on the beach with his sand toys. Riku is so very happy to sit in one spot playing with containers and shovels, and Miss Amelia is happy to sit as close to him as she possibly can, making it impossible for him to do a thing! </p>
<p>This is the funniest thing to see; Amelia is clear about her needs and then Riku has to figure out how to get her off him... it's adorable. We can distract Amelia for a few minutes but she sees her place as being right there with him. Amelia is a girl who knows what she wants and goes for it; it will be very interesting one day in the future to see how many fellows she brings home! </p>
<p>Amelia also likes to wander about on the beach, which keeps Susan very busy chasing after her. Today she was running, saying "I'm going to catch you, I'm going to catch you!" and Riku was smiling as he watched them, repeating to me "she's going to catch you". Not much later I was running after a squealing Riku, and then we switched so that Susan was running after Riku and I after Amelia. It was great fun; they found a big hole in the sand, watched some parasailors taking off, and found interesting feathers and sticks on their meanderings. The sand was blowing and it was a bit cooler than would have been ideal for me (I should have taken a light jacket) but it was really wonderful to be out in the air with nothing to do but enjoy the children and the big waves. </p>
<p>At 6 p.m. we left for home. Riku seemed just a little dozy as we started out, all that sun and exercise did their job, but I didn't want him sleeping so close to his bed time... so I sang song after song, with him making suggestions when I hesitated as to what the next one should be..."song about barn and chicken?', "song about mouse on clock?" and even "alliagtor song" which Bryn told me later is the one song he tends to sing to Riku. He was a happy little fellow when we pulled in the driveway. Doug was home from his trip earlier than he planned to be, so I asked him to blow up the pool a little more; Riku "helped" and then the two of them took a hammer and using a hammer broke up a pottery pot that was cracked. Riku quite enjoyed this! We were no sooner back in the door though when there was an IM from Bryn saying he was on his way from work to pick Riku up! Riku and I dashed upstairs for some time with his blocks and figurines... firemen tonight. </p>
<p>Thank goodness Doug was busy downloading photos as Bryn wanted to see the ones from the day before, when the children were "wrestling" on the bed. He took the time to see lots of others too, so Riku had a little more time here before he left for dinner. I carried him down to his car seat as that seems to make it a little easier to say goodbye on those days when he wouldn't mind just a little more time here. Bryn had bought him four new books and I waved goodbye to a happy little boy looking at one of them. </p>
<p>Later Bryn IM'd that Riku's saying "after" now, as in: "This one now, this one after." Nice concept to have... </p>
<p>Doug and I had a quick dinner of a vegie burger, and some carrot and celery sticks to munch on later, as we watched a video. Riku called at 9 p.m. to say goodnight though which was so wonderful. He was on the phone when I picked him up and we had a little chat before he hung up, saying "goodnight honey" and "see you 'morrow" in that sweet voice. What a lovely tradition this would be, a good night call to his Nana!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/two_in_their_beds.html">Two in Their Beds!</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke at 7 a.m. today and showered immediately; I had planned to pick Riku up at 11 a.m. and showering first is a good way for me to get started on my day early. It's a good thing I did, as Kevin called at 8:15. Susan was in a lot of abdominal pain and he was planning to take her to the hospital. I went over immediately, played with Amelia while Kevin was on the phone with the doctor's office and left an hour later, with nothing resolved yet. Susan was quite pale when I arrived but had some colour in her cheeks and was feeling a little better when I left. She was quite determined that she wasn't going to sit in the emergency room for three hours though... Kevin promised to keep in touch. </p>
<p>Amelia and I stopped in at Rainbow for a few groceries, and headed home. Susan told me the first word out of Amelia this morning was Riku, and at 10:45 she and I walked over to Riku's house. It was a long walk for her, but she was very excited to see Riku. They were adorable walking home together; Riku would reach out to take her hand, and he insisted on holding mine as well. The two of them did go running off together though, up and down the small ramp at the apartment building at the corner of the street and hiding in the tiny porches of the apartments on our street. </p>
<p>After "drawing" for about fifteen minutes, they both went upstairs to play for a while, and then carefully came down the stairs together. Riku now walks down but I insist that Amelia come down backwards still. The stairs are very steep and I am nervous; luckily Amelia co-operates. It was lunch time soon after and they sat together at the table to eat macaroni with sauteed mushrooms and cheese, with fresh berries and a cookie for dessert. </p>
<p>The blue jay appeared half way through their lunch, so I put out some peanuts and moved Amelia's chair so she could see the two jays picking them up. I broke some up as well, and gave each of them a couple of tiny handfulls to put on the ledge for the blue jays. As soon as the blue jays had flown off, I asked Riku what time it was and he immediately said "bedtime", which it was. Amelia had had an early morning and it was Riku's normal nap time when he is with me. </p>
<p>I have never had them both here before for their naps, and never have put Amelia in bed for hers; we always go out with her stroller. So I wasn't sure how it was going to go. I needn't have worried though, Riku played quietly upstairs "I'm busy, bulding" he told me as I picked up Amelia. She cried the tiniest bit, but I talked to her and tucked her into one of the twin beds in the front room. She snuggled very quickly into the duvet, clutching her monkey from home in her arms, and dutifully closed her eyes as I sang very softly to her and stroked her hair, her forehead and across her eyes. I walked in with her at 1 p.m. and walked out at 1:10! </p>
<p>Up I went for Riku, who just accepts the inevitable now; very rarely does he fuss about his nap time. It's a given, with a very familiar routine... a cotton blanket under his head and over him, shorts or pants off (he is a hot sleeper like Caillie), and the same singing, stroking routine while I sit beside him. At 1:22 I sat down to tell their parents they were tucked in. </p>
<p>I ate too quickly as I wasn't sure how much time I would have to clean up the kitchen and get a few little jobs done. At 1:55 Bryn wrote to see if they were still sleeping, and they were! Wow; even I was impressed! Amelia came out of the room on her own, smiling away at Doug sitting at the computer. She had slept for an hour and twenty-five minutes but had had a BC, which no doubt shortened her sleep. Riku slept exactly the same amount, walking out of his room ten minutes later. </p>
<p>Snack time... tiny quiches, dried apricots, drinks and then some popcorn, the first time I have given them any. They each had a small bowl of their own and sat very nicely munching away and looking at books. Then it was off to Riku's room for cars and rocks, and taking turns on the computer with BabyType, making lots of fun sounds by pushing on the keys. We read some stories on the bed and then they played with the tub toys! ... first time for this outside the tub; they were in the bathroom pulling them out and sharing them. </p>
<p>Susan called saying she was fine if not completely out of pain, and walking slowly home, enjoying the fresh air and sunshine. She had seen her doctor who assured her that all was well. </p>
<p>By four p.m. it was obvious that it was time for running around and having some space. Riku likes to have some quiet time and Amelia likes to be right beside Riku, so off to the playground we went. Doug came too, as we had only one stroller. Riku sat and nibbled on some snacks while Amelia walked happily along munching on hers and holding Doug's hand. We carried her for part of the time as well and reached the playground at 4:30. </p>
<p>This was just what they needed; the little inside room was open and they both enjoyed running about in there, going in and out of the tunnel and playing with a ball. We sat and rolled it to each other, one child at a time. There were so many children in the playground today with lots of toys to share. Amelia managed to snag a ride on toy and eventually found a tiny stroller as well. Riku was happy with the slide and the various bouncing toys, as well as just meandering about as he loves to do. At one point at older girl of eight or so started chasing Riku about and playing ball with him; he was a happy little fellow and she was so good with him. </p>
<p>Doug was amazed as he watched Amelia manoeuvering the little plastic riding car up three steps, figuring out each step beforehand and then carrying through with it successfully. She may be on her way to an engineering career; riding it down the ramp was the ultimate victory! </p>
<p>I took lots of photos of them and before we knew it, it was 5:50 and Kevin was there to pick up Amelia. I hope she didn't fall asleep in the car on the way home, as Susan is tired and needs an early to bed night too. </p>
<p>We dropped Riku off at home at 6:30. Akane had seen her new doctor today for the first time, her OB-GYN, and was tired out from the blood they had drawn from her. She looked very sleepy and I was happy to see Bryn on his way home, after stopping in to pick up a parcel that came for him. He was leaving just as we walked up to the house. </p>
<p>I had started preparing a spinach dish before going out, there were dishes to do, and toys to pick up, so I made a very quick dinner of pizza with some extras added to it, and cleaned the kitchen while it was baking. I am tired! </p>
<p>Doug went off to a movie with Bryn at 8:30, I made a hot cup of tea, and sat in the living room reading a magazine, dozing off a bit. And now here I sit, about to annotate a few photos before going off to bed. </p>
<p>Ah, one of the sweetest parts of my day was having Riku call at 8:20 to say "good night, sweetie" (after I had said this to him). He told me he had had his bath, and read a book... this is the third night in a row I have had this good night call, and it is the perfect almost-ending to my day.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/friday_my_favourite_day_of_the.html">Friday, My Favourite Day of the Week</a></h2>
								<p>Today was a perfectly lovely day, from beginning to end. I went off to the Kabuki just after 10 a.m. and enjoyed every single minute of my soaking, steaming, and sauna time. I put conditioner in my hair, a mask on my face, scrubbed my feet with pumice, and my body with sea salt. I drank lots of water with lemons floating in it, and took many deep breaths, drifting in and out of perfect bliss time. I could do this once a week and remain sane! </p>
<p>Two and a half hours later, I picked Riku up at his house and brought him here for his afternoon nap. Akane, Doug, Riku, and I had made plans this morning to fo to the SF art gallery... SFMOMA, after his nap, and this gave Akane some time on her own today as well. Riku was a tired boy but I gave him a fresh fruit snack of blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries (a;; courtesy of Auntie Susan); he sat on the counter with Doug holding the plate for him and ate every single bite, as well as a couple of bites of a Fig Newton. </p>
<p>Unfortunately he was scrambling up the stairs before this in fun, to get away from me when he first came in the house, and hurt his nose, I thought, bumping it on the stair rise. He cried hard, and after holding him for  a while he said he would like his snack. By the time I had that ready for him it was obvious it was his eye that he had hurt. He was willing to let me hold a cold cloth on it, which I hoped would help. </p>
<p>Doug also discovered two big bumps on his forehead, one of each side, and so he looks quite a sight. I think he might have a black eye for his first day of school on Monday, poor wee guy. It was swollen and red. </p>
<p>After eating, Riku settled into bed as quickly as always, hugging his two dogs today, and covered with his soft cotton dotted blanket. Much to my surprise he slept for two hours! </p>
<p>I sat and had some tea and read the rest of the morning paper, and even got started at annotating some of the Amelia photos in her online album. I'm almost done with hers and then will get started with the latest Riku photos as well. Then the trip to Japan, Taryn's and John's wedding, and our trip from here to Vancouver, on to Las Vegas and home will complete them all... eventually! </p>
<p>Riku walked happily out to the kitchen when he woke, he wanted only to snuggle in my arms, covered with the blanket and crying fitfully when I suggested getting his shirt and pants on and picking up mommy for our trip. This is not typical behavior at all for Riku. </p>
<p>Off we went to the sofa, with Riku's head buried in my shoulder, settling in deeper and deeper into a big cuddle. He didn't want to be read to, didn't want a drink, just wanted to do just what we were doing at that moment. I'm sure he was sore and not wanting to do much of anything until he was feeling a little more secure. </p>
<p>A half hour later we were out the door to get Akane, much later than we planned originally. Akane says she thinks the bumps on his forehead are bug bites and Doug thought so too; he often gets quite a reaction to bites. We parked by a little park, promising Riku we would go back to it, and were in the gallery by 5 p.m. </p>
<p>Riku and I played with some blocks in a visitors area; he shared some of his dried cranberries and blueberries with a ten month old girl, and we looked at a couple of books until he got bored with that and wanted to wander about. We climbed all the way to the top floor, and went across a glass bridge, which Riku found totally fascinating, and into a room with a video screen mounted on a wooden structure which was hung with all sorts of strange and some ordinary objects. Riku could not take his eyes off the screen!  I was bored with it within three minutes, but the fellow on the screen was hanging upside down, opening his mouth wide, pouring green paint down the side of a wall, and pretending to cry at times. Try as I might, I could not entice him to go and look at the giant painting of a tree in the next room, or anywhere else either. Yawn! Thank goodness a guard told us they would be closing in five minutes, as it gave me the excuse to move him on out of there. Downstairs he told Doug all about the man crying and went on at great length about all the other things he saw too. Even little TV's are very powerful! </p>
<p>I carried him to the little park, where he and Grandpa climbed up on a very tall slide and Riku slid down, as did Doug and me too. Riku was delighted! An older boy was there too, and willing to share his tiny blue truck with Riku; Riku is always happy to be playing with someone so they kept busy for a bit, until his dad and Ben, a work colleage, came by to pick up Akane and Riku for dinner in Chinatown.</p>
<p>Doug and I headed right over to Susan and Kevin's to babysit for them; I had called this morning and suggested a date night to them. Susan kindly cooked up some pasta for us, and they left as soon as they had finished up their dinner and decided on a movie. </p>
<p>Amelia was a very tired girl. Susan had tried unsuccessfully to get her to nap at 1 p.m. today but she was having none of it. Amelia was pretty wired when we arrived, running around and around and wanting to be chased. We played hide and seek for a few minutes, and she sat and ate a bit of toast and cheese while I ate, but as soon as she was finished she brushed her teeth and it was tuck-in time. She was so good; she wasn't thrilled with being put to bed, but settled so quickly for me. We read two stories in her darkened room, I sang her the three bedtime songs I always sing... "Wheels on the Bus", "Rock-a-Bye-Baby" and "You're My Honey Bunch... ", with her head on my shoulder, facing towards me. I could feel her body relaxing into me, and she wasn't quite asleep when I put her in the crib. Her eyes popped opened, but when I told her it was sleepy time and she should  close her eyes, she squinched them up and I left the room, closing her doors behind me. Amazingly, that was it... thirteen minutes from story time to leaving her room. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a rented movie of Susan and Kevin's ("Out to Sea") after I did up the dishes; I took in a cup of hot tea Susan had left for me and an hour later fell asleep with Doug rubbing my shoulders and back. I did manage to wake up in time for the last ten minutes of the movie though. </p>
<p>Susan walked in at 11 p.m., we chatted for a few minutes about their movie and ours (they haven't seen it yet), and then we went out to our car so that Kevin could pull right into our spot. Parking is at a premium at this hour of the night in most neighbourhoods. </p>
<p>Home, email, blog, bed... a lovely day indeed. </p>
<p>p.s. from Bryn in an IM this morning... </p>
<p>Riku said "broken chair, broken things" this morning; he seems to understand "things". This was from Richard Scarry... and "let's play together."</p>
<p>I replied: I like "what is happening here?" and "no taking, no taking."</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/a_saturday_at_home_and_happy_b.html">A Saturday at Home... and Happy Birthday to Gail!</a></h2>
								<p>I slept in this morning after turning out the light at 1 a.m; Amelia and Riku were out for breakfast with Susan, Kevin, friends of theirs and Bryn, at the "Pork Store" restaurant in the Haight. They called to say hello and it was such fun talking with both of them. Amelia said "hi" a lot, and Riku told me he was eating eggs. It was a lovelysurprise although it was very loud and we didn't talk long.  </p>
<p>I showered immediately and spent the next three hours busy on the computer... answering emails, annotatiing photos, and IM'ing with Myk' and Bryant. Lots of fun and Bry' has lots of new features to show to me. By noon hour I realized how hungry I was! I heated up three leftover pasta dishes from Amelia and Riku, and had my cup of hot chocolate while reading the paper, Quite the lazy morning! </p>
<p>I went back to dating and annotating Amelia's latest photos; there were lots of them, and Doug helped me with the dates from his machine. This saved me time, as some of Amelia's were taken with Susan's camera and were out of sequence. It had taken me a while to get organized with the camera when I first arrived home. </p>
<p>Bryn called at 2 p.m. to ask how things were going; I told him we were spending the day at home, which was just what I needed as I was getting lots of work done on the photos. He then said he wondered if I would like to see Riku, as he was going out to play ping pong with Brent. I, of course, said that would be lovely which made Bryn laugh, but of course I would rather see the children then work on photos of them! </p>
<p>Riku arrived at 2:20 and we had such a fun and busy time together. He wanted to "play upstairs" first so while he chatted away to the farm animals and played with Bryn's Fisher Price farm and camping set, I ironed all of Riku's little shirts from the laundry I did last week. I took some video of him talking away too, until I ran out of film. I must do more of this with both children... taping them, not running out of film! </p>
<p>We played on his bed with his cars and trucks, admiring how many he had, watered the garden, Riku played with a container of water as well when the watering was finished, we read books on his bed, eight in all, did some drawing, looked at pictures on the computer with Doug, ate some snacks and had such a great day together. </p>
<p>Bryn came by at 5:30 wondering if Riku would like to go home for dinner or stay here; his answer was "stay at Nana's house, eat dinner" so that is what we did. While I made dinner, he played in the sink for a long time. We called Auntie Gail to wish her a "Happy Birthday" and Riku also said it very clearly to her, and she overheard him asking for containers for the sink. He is learning more and more words and phrases every day now and it amazes me. "What is happening here?" and "Where did this come from?" or "go?" He also is very willing to repeat a word to get it correct... today we practiced "road" instead of "load" and he did it. The new sentences come so quickly I am going to have to start writing them down immediately. </p>
<p>We called Gail to sing "Happy Birthday" to her and to arrange to talk longer another day. Riku took the phone though and said very clearly "Happy Birthday, Auntie Gail" and she heard him asking for "more containers" as he was busy playing in the sink when we called. She was amazed at how much his speaking has improved just since she saw him in April, but I am amazed too as every week brings another new phrase or understanding of a new concept. </p>
<p>Doug and I walked Riku home at 7 p.m., swinging him almost the entire way. Halfway there I suggested that Riku start counting for the swing; he started off at the same pace that we did, but before long it was "One, two, three, swing!" said very very quickly! It was lots of fun and we stopped only to walk across the roads carefully. </p>
<p>As soon as we got home I got him started on his bedtime routine; he was very tired from a two hour morning nap that ended at 12:30 today so he had been up for a long time today. I rubbed him with lots of cream, as his skin has been dry lately (not much humidity here right now), got him into his pjs after he used the toilet successfully for the fourth time today just with me!, brushed his teeth, had a drink of water, and said goodnight to his Grandpa. He asked for "Walter" for his story but we couldn't find that lazy mouse book and he settled for "Are You My Mother?" instead. Riku was sound asleep before I sang two songs to him. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn came home from their dinner in Chinatown not long after Riku was tucked in; I had just made a cup of tea, and stayed on to play a round of "Spades" leaving as soon as I had lost! Doug patiently sat and read while this was going on; I wanted some company on the way there and back and we were home at 10 p.m. Watched the final season's show of the "Super Nanny" which Doug had taped and ate some kettle corn, too late to be wise, but it sure was good! Bed at midnight.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/gay_pride_day.html">Gay Pride Day</a></h2>
								<p>I had a very short morning here at home today. I slept in a bit more than usual, and answered a few emails, leaving myself just enough time to have a small cup of hot chocolate and eating a few almonds, before leaving the house.  </p>
<p>We had asked Bryn and Akane last night if we could take Riku off to SF's biggest parade, Gay Pride Day, and at 10 a.m. we picked him up. He was excited about seeing "many people, clowns, many motorcycles, and loud music" as we discussed it all in the car on the way over to Market Street. We had to park seven long blocks away and Riku ran merrily along, stopping occasionally to look at something interesting in a window and then running until something else caught his eye. Doug was way ahead of us, but we kept his bright pink jacket in view. </p>
<p>Riku and I lucked out with a seat on the curb in front of some people with chairs. We arrived just as "Dykes on Bikes" started the parade; all those motorcycles was very exciting for Riku, but I think he liked all the waving that was going on. It didn't take long before he was waving as well, at everyone that passed by and waved to our area of the crowd. Over a million visitors are in San Francisco for this weekend, and considering the city has about 750,000 people normally, that is quite the crowd... and it was! After the motorcycles came "Mikes on Bikes" with just as many outrageous costumes, or no-clothing at all as the female contingent. </p>
<p>Riku certainly enjoyed the flag=waving (he was given a Rainbow flag from one of the attendees and this made his day!); he waved his little flag through the guard rails for the rest of our time there. He loved the brass bands, and the huge turtle, and the fellows all decked out in almost nothing but long, very long, skinny balloons, and not much else! He was also one of the lucky recipients of a pink necklace and a tiny pink rubbery ball with antennae. For a while, between events, he played with bits of coloured paper, perfectly content with scrunching it up and rolling it, until it was time to wave that flag again. It's a very friendly parade with lots of smiles from the crowd and the folks in the parade, so we all enjoyed it very much. After an hour and a half Riku said "All done, go home?" so off we went. </p>
<p>We did "one, two, three, swing!" for most of the way back to the car, although did stop to admire some stone steps along the way, with a steep wall which an older girl climbed up on. Riku declined to follow her; he is our cautious guy but he sure enjoyed watching her do it so makes a great audience! </p>
<p>Back at home I immediately gave Riku his lunch; it was obvious that he was tired, but he ate well, and sat at the table with Grandpa eating.  He was asleep just minutes after I tucked him in but woke an hour later with a dirty diaper... too bad, as it wasn't quite enough sleep for him. He was happy to lie in my arms, snuggled up with his blanket over him, but couldn't quite talk himself into letting go and nodding off again. </p>
<p>We had a wonderful afternoon together though; he played with Grandpa on the bed with the wooden blocks which haven't been used much. These belonged to both his Grandpa and his Daddy when they were little, but they work much better on the floor. I made up "better butter" and a banana bread loaf for Akane and Bryn (and Riku too!) and as soon as I was done I took over and we moved to the living room floor. Together we built quite a nice house with many turrets and bits on tops of bits; we have quite a collection of small wooden pieces which are very decorative and fit on the smallest towers. This took us a long time and then Riku decided it was time for it to come tumbling down. </p>
<p>After a snack and some drawing time (I had to draw a boat, and some small fish, and a big fish at Riku's request) Riku and I did something brand new for us. We have done a bit of "acting" before but today Riku wanted me to pretend I was "angry" and so I growled and gestured and snarled away, making him laugh out loud for such a long time. We went into "sad" and "happy" too but the one that made him laugh the most was "angry". He is so funny when he does it and he relys mostly on moving his eyebrows, which is hilarious! Later on he demonstrated this to Akane and Bryn, but not to quite the same extent. It is wonderful that he gets "pretend" so well though as it is not an easy concept for every child. </p>
<p>After that we settled in with some books... many books actually. Riku was quite happy to sit reading together and turned down the opportunity to water the garden... much to my surprise. I think it was having not quite enough sleep that made him enjoy more mellow sitting- down time with me. </p>
<p>His parents came over to get him at 5:30, waiting until we finished reading "Go Dog Go", another of his Daddy's favourite books when he was a child. </p>
<p>I made a quick dinner for Doug and me, and got busy annotating photos, finishing up Amelia's for this year and getting started on our trip from Vancouver to Las Vegas to San Francisco. </p>
<p>Riku called at 8:50 to say "good night", which is the loveliest little tradition I can think of to end my day with him. He always repeats what I call him, as I say goodnight to him, and tonight it was "goodnight sweetheart" and then ending with "goodnight sweetie" as we said a second goodbye. It's a big day tomorrow; Riku's first day at nursery school!</p>
<p>Doug was busy working on new class material for a teaching stint in Virginia over the next four days, and I kept at the photos until it was time to go up to bed. Alas, knowing I had to get up in less than six hours made it hard for me to go to sleep, and so here I am, at 1:20 a.m. writing this blog... time to turn in again though...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/rikus_first_day_of_preschool.html">Riku's First Day of Preschool</a></h2>
								<p>My day started very early, as did Doug's, as we left the house at 5:30 a.m. for the Oakland airport. Doug will be in Virginia for four days. It was 6:30 by the time I got home so there was no point in going back to bed. I had my breakfast while reading the morning paper, and then started in on my paper work. </p>
<p>Bryn had asked if I would like to accompany them to drop Riku off at "The Little Angels" daycare program, but I decided to let them take him and I will go with Akane to pick him up at 1 p.m. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane stayed with him for twenty minutes but when it was obvious they intended to leave he cried. I suppose we all were expecting it, but it was still hard; Bryn said he cried for five minutes before he left him and then for a few more minutes more until after Akane left. Poor wee guy. He is there from 9 a.m. 'til 1 p.m. and it must have been hard for him to understand why he was being left with strangers. Sometimes being a child is tough! </p>
<p>I managed to get lots of sorting done, wrote some emails, chatted a long time with Candy on the phone, and finally packed up a small snack for Riku as I think he might need a snack before he sleeps. My guess was that he would be tired out from his busy morning. I picked Akane up at 12:30 at the studio, and we were outside the doors at 12:55. </p>
<p>Riku came barrelling out, with arms open wide, when he spotted us. He sat in the car and ate his yogurt, drank some "super food" and before I could finish one little nursery rhyme (we hoped to keep him awake long enough to tuck him in at home) he was sound asleep. Akane needed a few things at Rainbow Grocers so we stopped there; I sat and read while Riku slept and then dropped Akane at home. I parked the car in a shady spot in Potrero Hill, but he awoke after 80 minutes, still obviously tired. So... what to do??? I started up the car and drove to Ocean Beach. Riku was asleep again within minutes, but Ocean Beach seems a good destination anyway. I got to sit and read, while watching the ocean, and Riku slept for two full hours in total. We went for a walk along the beach; it was cool so I wasn't tempted to get out the sand toys, and Riku was happy to stroll and run along on his own. </p>
<p>Once it got windier and blowy we got back in the car, heading for Safeway for a bathroom stop and to pick up a sandwich for me. I was hungry! Riku happily ate some more snacks and we stopped in at almost  5 p.m. for some time with Amelia and Susan. Amelia has a tent in her room so they had fun crawling in and out of that, eating a few cookie halves, and then going over to the playground for some outside time.</p>
<p>Amelia looked particularly fetching today in a darling black and white hat, matching her sweater. The two children look ever so cute together, with her very fair hair and his dark hair. He looks like quite the little guy, especially now that he has put on some more weight, and Amelia looks dainty and slim with her chubbiness gone. </p>
<p>Amelia was her busy self on the long winding slide; Riku climbed on the steps, thought about going down, thought again and decided against it. He did this a few times and one day he will just do it! A woman there commented on just how athletic Amelia is, and she is right.While Amelia was busy with the slide and hanging from the bars, Riku  played quietly in a corner, mostly on his own, with someone else's toys. </p>
<p>Back to Susan's for just a minute to pick up some bananas for bread, and a cookbook. In just that last minute Riku bit Amelia on her hand, which looked really nasty; he knew he had done something wrong as Amelia was really crying hard. I hope that will be the very last time this happens.<br />
 <br />
After buckling Riku into his car seat, I got stuck beside a police car, while the officers ticketed someone; it seemed to take longer than the seventeen minutes I waited there. Arggh! Riku ate a half slice of banana bread, as he was hungry again, but I knew he would be eating dinner soon. </p>
<p>Dropped him off at 6:45; the first words he spoke to his dad were "Riku bite 'melia" so he obviously knew that was something wrong. Nice that he "fessed" up! </p>
<p>Home for a quick and easy dinner; I don't have much energy left due to my two and a half hours sleep last night!, so lazed about, reading on the sofa, which was such a treat, and writing a few emails before turning in at 10:20. Tonight I won't be worrying about how little sleep I will be getting and will be able to fall asleep more easily!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/down_at_the_station.html">"Down at the Station... "</a></h2>
								<p>I'm off to bed so shall keep this short and sweet. Home in a.m. Talked to Candy, wrote some emails, did some more paper sorting, and put off writing the notes I absolutely have to do tomorrow! </p>
<p>Packed up a lunch/snack for Riku and left the house at 12:30 to pick  him up from nursery school at 1 p.m. He was a happy boy when he came walking out of the big room and spotted me waiting for him. I got a big hug, and we sat in the back seat of the car together while he ate his yogurt with blueberries and a big container of "super food" again today. </p>
<p>His news of the day at school; he painted (black paint on the back of his hand), he sang ("not ABC" but later recanted his story), "play with blocks", and for snack "ice cream! We sang all the way home, much to my surprise; he didn't seem quite as wiped out today as he was yesterday. However, it was obvious it was nap time, so after a hand and face wash, and two stories, Riku was fast asleep in his bed in just minutes. He now likes to cuddle his spotted cotton blanket near his neck and shoulder, and looks so sweet with his bare tummy and legs showing from underneath. </p>
<p>He slept for two full hours but did not want to just get up and at it when he did waken. We cuddled for the longest time; he was on my lap with the blanket over him while I "skyped" with Doug and managed a quiet little "bye Blaunka" at the end of the conversation. We went into the living room and cuddled some more, reading "Go Dog Go" which we just started reading this week, and which he really likes (so did his daddy) and then leafed slowly through every single page of the large Richard Scarey book of trucks, etc. Riku asked for a snack  while we were reading... specifically for a banana and ate a slice of toast too... and lots of water. Bryn says he will ask them about whether he can take a water cup with him, as he has been thirstier than usual the past two days.</p>
<p>Finally, late in the day, we got out to water the garden as I had promised him we would; he did a great job with the flowers and rose bushes, and when that was done he asked for his broom so he could sweep. This was a lovely mellow time for him too and a perfect little ending to our afternoon here. </p>
<p>Akane called to see how he was doing, and invited me to dinner... a Japanese pancake of cabbage/onion and various other ingredients, and a dish I like a lot. Riku and I left with the stroller at 6 p.m. for a quick walk to the playground. As I turned to shut the garage door, Riku said to me "seat belt!" to remind me that I hadn't done it up yet. I never really though he had paid much attention to it! </p>
<p>The best part of today happened on our walk to the playground. We were singing as we walked along, and after finishing "the barn chicken" song (Old MacDonald) I started singing "Down at the Station". I always hesitate a little bit when singing familiar songs to allow him time to fill in words at the end of the verse, but today he just sang the entire song by himself! It was just adorable! and he had it all right too. I love the way he says "see the little puffbellies all in "low" instead of a "row". Yes, he has a little Japanese blood in him! </p>
<p>I was so excited about this, his very first complete song ever (except perhaps for "cean up, cean up, everbody, eveywhere" but only sings the first verse of that. He sang the station song for his mommy too, and she was excited as well, but when I asked him if he would sing it for Bryn he said "Riku busy bulding now... later on" and he did sing it later, at the table. We all clapped and Riku smiled away at us smiling at him. </p>
<p>When we first arrived, Riku and I went right into his room to play ("Nana, come play!") with his blocks while Akane finished cooking dinner. Bryn joined us after a bit and Riku did something else he has never done with me; his daddy kissed/blew on the back of his neck so Riku came over and did the same to me. This really truly does give me goosebumps and I automatically pull up my shoulders; Riku just laughed and laughed and even louder when he asked his daddy to "do that to Nana!" and he did! What a guy this Riku is; such a wonderful personality for such a little guy! </p>
<p>I so enjoy my time with him; even sitting building a "bulding" with him is interesting, as he asks "where this go?" and listens to suggestions, and pulls his eyebrows together as he fits pieces in the right places, and really truly interacts with me while we're together. Before bed we both tidied up the blocks; Riku is very meticulous and we have to pull apart every single block. If he spots one that has two together it is taken apart immediately and then goes back into the box. He takes this cleaning up quite seriously and we finish in no time! He is such a loving, funny, and sweet little boy.  </p>
<p>Dinner was delicious as always, and Riku ate a nice sized portion as well as two plums for dessert. I had three wedges of it and was perfectly content. Right after dinner, Bryn ran Riku's bath, and I sat on the floor besdie the tub, while he happily played with all the plastic containers he found in the drawer. He had a funnel and we played together with that, filling up containers and letting it run over his shoulders and back. "Ahhhhh" says Riku when I do this. I washed his hair and gave him a few more minutes to finish up before getting him all lotioned up and into his pj's. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane were lying on the bed as I did this, and as I had carried Riku into the bedroom all snuggled up in his towel (as I always do), he pretended he was a baby!, with little wailing sounds, whimpering, rubbing his eyes... what a character he is! He would even say "I am a baby" and make more sounds; I made nice little soothing sounds at him while rubbing him with his creams and finishing off with a foot and toe massage, which he always likes. </p>
<p>Story time with Nana, and tuck-in time with Mommy, later than was planned... at 9:20 I left for home and Bryn and I could hear Riku still chatting. Bryn's guess was that Akane was asleep though! Oh, tomorrow will not be an easy day at school drop-off for Riku is my guess... and I might be dropping him! </p>
<p>Tomorrow is an Amelia day... and it looks as though it's going to be nice and sunny... hope so. Bed 11:30... too late!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/06/a_riku_amelia_riku_day.html">A Riku, Amelia, Riku Day!</a></h2>
								<p>Well, today was my turn to take Riku to school and have to leave him there. Bryn has his Japanese class tonight, leaves early and asked if I would mind taking Riku to school so he could get to work a little earlier. No problem, although I wasn't looking forward to seeing him upset. He came down to the car telling me "no teacher, no school" and on the drive there, in between singing bouts, I heard it again as well as "No children!". </p>
<p>We had to park a long two and a half blocks away from the school, so that was fun! We got to "no chase me!" and run and look at a couple of things, but within that final half block Riku wanted up in my arms and started protesting, with a little cry in his voice. It really increased the minute we walked in the door and he clung so hard to me. </p>
<p>One of the teachers brought over the sticker selection for his daily logbook, and he was willing to point to it and stick it in as long as he had one firm hand clinging to my jacket! It took two teachers to get his now-two hands away from my jacket and it was so sad. This has to get better very soon! I left immediately after a kiss and a "see you later" as there was no point at all in prolonging the agony for either of us. It was a tough walk back to the car leaving him like this. </p>
<p>Amelia was to spend the day with me today, as Susan has some appointments. I parked on Fell and they were in the playground waiting for me at 9:30. "Hi Nana!" said Amelia and I was happy to see her too! We stayed there for about forty minutes with Amelia climbing up and down the playhouse; I am astounded at her confidence on the wooden play structure. She shows no fear whatsoever about clambering over and around on anything she can thing of!  Over the course of the time there though she was showing signs she was a tired girl (rubbing her eyes is the giveaway!). We picked up her lunch bag and snacks at the house, and were on our way to Rhode Island Street by 11 a.m. </p>
<p>It was a gorgeous sunny day with a warm breeze, so I opened all four windows a bit and we sang songs all the way home. I gave Amelia some of her lunch early so she wouldn't be starving when she awoke, and I had a vegie burger as well as I hadn't eaten breakfast before leaving this morning. </p>
<p>Amelia was tucked in by noon hour, and went down so very easily... blinds shut, she turned on the "water" sound, snuggled in with a soft blanket and two animals, I walked out the door five minutes later. She slept for two solid hours. I worked on emails for a bit, made a banana bread to send home with Susan and also some gomai, an Asian cold spinach dish we both love. I also thoroughly cleaned my kitchen counters, stove and microwave as I just haven't had much housework time lately! </p>
<p>Amelia and I had a fun afternoon together after she ate a really large lunch; Susan packs such wonderful meals for her... spinach and rice, quiche, a little Indian curry, a selection of cut up fresh fruit, pudding, applesauce, yogurt, tiny pieces of cheese, toast, avocado.. so if she isn't in the mood for one thing there is always something else to offer. She eats very well though, and once she has decided that she has had enough that's it! Not one bite after that "no".</p>
<p>We read some stories, she pushed the "bee" around the house (one of her favourite things to do each time she is here), played "BabyType" on the computer for about ten minutes, and had a big play in the sink too. The time flew by and before I knew it, it was time to walk over to the playground. Susan was going to meet us there at 5:30 after we had had some playtime first. </p>
<p>I stopped by the dry cleaners to see how Lily was doing, as her husband was in the shop. He gave me the most horrific news; on May 8th, Lily was attacked by a man with a knife and she was stabbed about the head and face four times. She had been in the hospital for over a month and had just been released within the last couple of days. I cannot imagine what an awful ordeal this must have been for her! She lay for an hour before her husband found her; his voice was shaking as he told me about it. I cannot imagine how Lily is going to be able to go back into the shop to work ever again. </p>
<p>Amelia and I got to the playground at 4 p.m. and it was so busy with lots of children and their parents. There were lots of little ones Amelia's age, which was lovely for her, and she had such a great time climbing up on the "house" structure, interacting with them, and rushing down the slide... up and down, over and around, busy as busy can be! </p>
<p>I had asked Akane to join us there after Riku's nap, but it took Akane four hours to get from the school and home again. She had a city train driver who wouldn't let her on the streetcar unless Riku was taken out and the stroller folded!, and then stopped for some food and drinks on the way home. A long day for them both... </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Riku had only slept an hour, so was no doubt tuckered out from his busy morning and a too long stroller ride too. Akane arrived at 5:45 and thank goodness the playground no longer closes at 6 p.m. as Riku enjoyed his time running and being active. It was obvious he was tired as he didn't have much patience with the other children, frowning at them if they touched anything he was near. Not typical Riku behavior at all, as he always enjoys company. </p>
<p>Susan and Amelia left at 6 p.m. for home and a bath. Akane left to buy some dinner, the playground emptied out of most of the children and Riku was free to run up and down the ramp, gather up some pretty coloured pieces of paper, and climb with no interference from anyone at all. It really was just what he needed; he was a happy boy. He even let me put him in the stroller; Riku walks home from the park 90% of the time. Akane met us at the corner for the short walk to the house. </p>
<p>As soon as we walked in the door he said "Nana, let's play together!"<br />
It's the first time I've heard that phrase from him... so cute! and so we did, as Akane assembled his dinner plate. We all sat at the table together... Akane had bought me a delicious vegie burrito... with grilled onions, vegies, black beans, and mushrooms... it was sooo good but I ate only half, and told Akane she could offer the rest of it to Bryn after his class. Riku had rice with fish sprinkles, lovely cooked carrots from a stew that Akane had made, some soft tofu, and then extra rice, some Japanese pickles, and more carrots, and then polished off a bowl of strawberry yogurt with flax seed in it! What a nice round belly he had! </p>
<p>As his tub was filling we went back to making our "bulding" higher and higher, and when asked Riku said we would break it "after bathtime". It was a ten minute tub only, as I wanted him ready for bed early, but he had all his plastic tub toys in with him, and we splashed and played with Riku relaxing in the warm water. Again tonight he went into his "I baby" routine after wrapping him in his towel and carrying him into the bedroom for his "massage" and pj time. Akane was lying on the bed as he was doing his baby whimpering and "crying"; he made us both smile as he did his acting job so well. Have no idea what brought this on, but it is adorable. </p>
<p>I read him "Walter the Lazy Mouse" again, and left as Akane walked him into the bedroom for stories with her and a tuck in. Bryn told me that he awoke at 9:30 with a full diaper but went right back to sleep. All that food he packed in tonight had to go somewhere! </p>
<p>It was 8:45 when I walked in the door, twelve and a half hours since I had left to pick Riku up for school. There was another sad message awaiting me. Mrs. Thorne, Marie's mom died unexpectantly of a massive heart attack at 5:30 their time today. Marie was so upset on the machine, saying she would be up for a while, and so I called her back at midnight her time, and we talked for a half hour. It is all so sad and I know it will take Marie a long time to get over it. I think it's harder for her as there wasn't any indication she was in such distress. </p>
<p>In the kitchen, on the counter, was a beautiful bouquet of tightly closed bright orange irisis, already arranged in a vase, and in the fridge was a bag full of goodies... four of my very favourite dishes from Japantown. Susan had stopped in here before going to the playground and left these all for me! </p>
<p>Not much energy for much besides a few emails and this blog; off to bed to start a new book.</p>

								<p>Well, today my baby sister is 54 years old! Hmm, guess that means that I am getting up there too. Hard to imagine. I never did mind growing older, and I guess just when I was at the stage where I could see how it might be disconcerting, Gilda Radner was dying of cancer and all she wanted was to live to have her 40th birthday. That certainly put aging into perspective, and I truly do celebrate every birthday I am lucky enough to have! </p>
<p>Susan had a couple of appointments today which meant that Amelia and I got to spend the day together! Susan had intended to come here between appointments to feed Amelia her lunch and take her for a walk, but I suggested she instead take the time for herself... see an early movie, have a nice lunch out, or just put her feet up and relax. I was so happy she agreed to do this as it was a warm and sunny day and Amelia and I had lots to do to keep us busy. </p>
<p>Amelia and I spent some time in the garden, which she loves to do. She played with water, had some snacks outside, and then we went off for her walk through the Mission District. It was a hot day and Amelia napped, despite the heat, for seventy minutes. Maybe not quite enough, although she is a child who always wakens easily and happily. </p>
<p>We came back home; I fed a very hungry girl lots of her packed lunch... spinach with rice, pesto pasta, a combination of fresh fruit, steamed carrots, banana bread, etc. After lunch she gave Robin a bath in the back yard, and puttered about until 4 p.m. </p>
<p>I walked over to Riku's with Amelia at 4 p.m. and we met Susan there soon after. She had bought inari (ginger and sweet vinegar-flavoured rice wrapped in fried tofu skin) for me in Japantown, and a few other food treats as well. We all had some time in the playground together, I scarfed down all five of the inari! but did have the discipline not to eat the other two dishes as well... kabocha squash and some delicious green beans. </p>
<p>Riku had a great time at the playground; he was a busy boy the whole time and I hope it was enough to help him drop off to sleep easily tonight. The best part of the day for him was his petting and holding the sweetest golden puppy... a pretty little gal... just before we left. He was so happy to have access for so long to this gentle little dog;  Amelia would have loved her as well.</p>
<p>I took Riku home at 6:15 and dashed home, tidied up a bit, and checked Doug's flight time, due to arrive at 7:11 p.m. originally. It was going to be fifty minutes late, so I had a little breathing room here; time for a hot cuppa and to read the paper. </p>
<p>Off to get Doug but we had to wait a long while for his checked bag; Doug is not a happy man when he needs to hang around waiting for checked business equipment to show up. It took over a half hour tonight and he was tired after an early arising, and a long day following.  </p>
<p>So, a busy day for me, but a relaxing one too, with all the exercise and playground time. I finished the day off with emails, a little reading in the living room, and off to bed earlier than usual... tired. </p>
