								<h2>The Flashlight Isn't the Only Thing Beaming!</h2>
								<p>A lazy Saturday, the first in six weeks at home! I slept in for a bit today, just enjoying the freedom to do so. It's my favourite way to start the day, and then I was ready to get up and on with it. I did laze about though in my nightie until I talked with Caillie and Bryant, as planned yesterday. </p>
<p>Caillie is changing... she used to love to chat on the phone many years ago, but for the past two or more years she has been in a big hurry to get on with other things. But today we just chatted away and it was such a pleasure. I mentioned this to her and her response was "Well, I guess I am just growing up"! I guess she is and I am glad. </p>
<p>Bryant has impetigo and so his 10th birthday party for friends was cancelled today, postponed until July. He didn't sound too sad though although was not happy with the big red crusty sores on his face. He is hoping they will be gone by Monday when he has to return to school but he didn't sound too hopeful that they would be. They were all off to a movie, except for Caillie, who is attending a birthday party for an 11 year old! </p>
<p>I started the laundry and answered a few emails, ate, and read the paper. Bryn lost his car key... seems to be running in the family this week as I lost mine on Tuesday... so Doug went over with it. We had lunch at home and then went off to a double feature movie at the Four Star Cinema, my first movie in seven weeks or more. It was a treat for sure. I do love to sit in a dark theatre and not think about all the other things I should be doing! The second film, a French film ("Look at Me") made by a Canadian, was very well acted and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The first was an American film called "The Crash"; it certainly kept me on the edge of my seat and I enjoyed it as well. </p>
<p>We stopped at the grocery store on the way home, checked out a street fair for fifteen minutes, and headed home for dinner at 6:30... corn on the cob, fresh tomatoes, and a "Philly Cheesesteak" burger, vegie of course. It was all good and hit the spot. </p>
<p>I was feeling a little low, having not seen Riku today or yesterday (I am going through withdrawal still after all our time together in Japan) when the doorbell rang and I was greeted with that happy little face of his. Bryn was over with the laundry and some time for us with Riku while he and Akane went to Rainbow for groceries. Bryn put in a load of laundry and then we sat and chatted about Riku going to summer school, while Riku drew with his new pens from Japan. This time with Riku was just what I needed! That smiling face never fails to cheer me up. </p>
<p>We went upstairs and built a bridge and Riku filled up one of the Lego platforms with lots of Lego blocks. He hadn't eaten much dinner at home so I made him a bowl of four-grain cereal with fresh strawberries, a piece of toast, and when Grandpa ate some custard with strawberries Riku kept right up with him, spooning his all up too! </p>
<p>We had only an hour or so alone together and of course that time flew by. Bryn came by to pick him up about 9 p.m. (he had napped late today) and suggested that we walk Riku home to give him a little extra time and exercise too. I talked Doug into coming too, which was great, as he thought to take along a flashlight with us; it was dark but with a big moon and some stars shining as well. He wanted Doug to carry him, which meant that he could shine the flashlight up high into the trees, onto the sidewalk and our shadows from his perch in Grandpa's arms, onto cars, and signs... what a great time he had. Doug commented while we were walking that the flashlight wasn't the only thing beaming, and it sure wasn't! Riku was one big smiling face from the time we left our house until we got to his house. The lights are out on the top two floors there right now and so the big ending to his day was lighting our way up the stairs. He said goodnight to us happily and we were on our way home, leaving him with his mommy.</p>
