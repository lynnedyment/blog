								<h2>Ah, The End of My First Week at Home</h2>
								<p>And how the five days did fly by! It doesn't seem quite possible that I have been home for so long as I am still catching up after six weeks away... lots of paper work, laundry, housework, and emails. Mostly though I have been spending as much time as possible with Amelia and Riku, which is of course why the time has flown by. </p>
<p>I slept in until 7:10 this morning and popped right into the shower. Finally started getting some things done around the house but did take a break and catch up on the last couple of days of the local paper, over a big cup of hot chocolate. </p>
<p>Susan came over at 10:45 with Amelia, who had fallen asleep in the car. She was successfully transferred to her big comfy stroller, and she and I went off for what turned out to be a two and a half hour nap for Amelia. It was a gorgeous day, sunny and a bit breezy, perfect for a long walk. </p>
<p>Doug took the local bus from the airport and was home when Amelia woke up at 1:15. She was a happy girl to see Doug and had her arms wrapped around his neck from the time he picked her up out of the stroller until they were upstairs and taking off her jacket. Lunch time followed immediately and Amelia was a hungry girl once more. We had such fun at the table; she and Doug made horse sounds and Amelia flipped through some cards of paintings, pointing all the familiar things she spotted. Her newest "thing" since I came home is her very sweet "uh huh" when you ask her something. The occasionaly "no" gets in there but far more "uh huhs". It's so very cute. Even when Amelia says no she often means "yes" but I'm sure that won't last long. Susan came in just as she was finishing up a big portion of fresh fruit, and we chatted for a bit before they left for the playground. </p>
<p>I was hoping to hear from Akane during the afternoon, so that I could take Riku for a walk or have some time in the yard with me. While I was waiting, I went upstairs with a pot of tea (Susan bought me a box of English tea today!) and a Joseph Schmidt truffle, also from Susan. Delish'! I sat and enjoyed some taped Oprah's from late May, feeling that I was getting yet another chore done, a very relaxing chore at that. </p>
<p>Doug and I shared a store bought pizza, doctored up with spinach, mushrooms, fresh tomatoes, oregano, and Buffalo mozzarella cheese, along with the ever-present plate of carrot and celery sticks, our old standby vegies. </p>
<p>Before going back up to finish the last of the Oprah's on one tape, I took up all the mail from the past six weeks and did a big sort while sitting there. There was a huge stack so it was great to get rid of all that excess paper; now for the filing and bill-paying.</p>
<p>Riku called as I sat there; they had been over to Susan, Kevin's and Amelia's for some of the evening and Riku told me all about it. Amelia shared her toys with him, and he played with her stroller and buggy, or so he claimed. It was lovely to hear his voice; I am still going through withdrawal symptoms after those three solid weeks in Japan. Perhaps I will see him tomorrow. </p>
<p>Put another load of laundry in before heading up to bed; not many emails today which should be a relief but made me feel a little lonely too. Gail, Tom, Rick, and Candy are in Seattle for three days and I didn't manage to connect with Caillie or any of the other children either. Perhaps tomorrow... </p>
<p>Bedtime... 10:30. Night night.</p>
