								<h2>"Down at the Station... "</h2>
								<p>I'm off to bed so shall keep this short and sweet. Home in a.m. Talked to Candy, wrote some emails, did some more paper sorting, and put off writing the notes I absolutely have to do tomorrow! </p>
<p>Packed up a lunch/snack for Riku and left the house at 12:30 to pick  him up from nursery school at 1 p.m. He was a happy boy when he came walking out of the big room and spotted me waiting for him. I got a big hug, and we sat in the back seat of the car together while he ate his yogurt with blueberries and a big container of "super food" again today. </p>
<p>His news of the day at school; he painted (black paint on the back of his hand), he sang ("not ABC" but later recanted his story), "play with blocks", and for snack "ice cream! We sang all the way home, much to my surprise; he didn't seem quite as wiped out today as he was yesterday. However, it was obvious it was nap time, so after a hand and face wash, and two stories, Riku was fast asleep in his bed in just minutes. He now likes to cuddle his spotted cotton blanket near his neck and shoulder, and looks so sweet with his bare tummy and legs showing from underneath. </p>
<p>He slept for two full hours but did not want to just get up and at it when he did waken. We cuddled for the longest time; he was on my lap with the blanket over him while I "skyped" with Doug and managed a quiet little "bye Blaunka" at the end of the conversation. We went into the living room and cuddled some more, reading "Go Dog Go" which we just started reading this week, and which he really likes (so did his daddy) and then leafed slowly through every single page of the large Richard Scarey book of trucks, etc. Riku asked for a snack  while we were reading... specifically for a banana and ate a slice of toast too... and lots of water. Bryn says he will ask them about whether he can take a water cup with him, as he has been thirstier than usual the past two days.</p>
<p>Finally, late in the day, we got out to water the garden as I had promised him we would; he did a great job with the flowers and rose bushes, and when that was done he asked for his broom so he could sweep. This was a lovely mellow time for him too and a perfect little ending to our afternoon here. </p>
<p>Akane called to see how he was doing, and invited me to dinner... a Japanese pancake of cabbage/onion and various other ingredients, and a dish I like a lot. Riku and I left with the stroller at 6 p.m. for a quick walk to the playground. As I turned to shut the garage door, Riku said to me "seat belt!" to remind me that I hadn't done it up yet. I never really though he had paid much attention to it! </p>
<p>The best part of today happened on our walk to the playground. We were singing as we walked along, and after finishing "the barn chicken" song (Old MacDonald) I started singing "Down at the Station". I always hesitate a little bit when singing familiar songs to allow him time to fill in words at the end of the verse, but today he just sang the entire song by himself! It was just adorable! and he had it all right too. I love the way he says "see the little puffbellies all in "low" instead of a "row". Yes, he has a little Japanese blood in him! </p>
<p>I was so excited about this, his very first complete song ever (except perhaps for "cean up, cean up, everbody, eveywhere" but only sings the first verse of that. He sang the station song for his mommy too, and she was excited as well, but when I asked him if he would sing it for Bryn he said "Riku busy bulding now... later on" and he did sing it later, at the table. We all clapped and Riku smiled away at us smiling at him. </p>
<p>When we first arrived, Riku and I went right into his room to play ("Nana, come play!") with his blocks while Akane finished cooking dinner. Bryn joined us after a bit and Riku did something else he has never done with me; his daddy kissed/blew on the back of his neck so Riku came over and did the same to me. This really truly does give me goosebumps and I automatically pull up my shoulders; Riku just laughed and laughed and even louder when he asked his daddy to "do that to Nana!" and he did! What a guy this Riku is; such a wonderful personality for such a little guy! </p>
<p>I so enjoy my time with him; even sitting building a "bulding" with him is interesting, as he asks "where this go?" and listens to suggestions, and pulls his eyebrows together as he fits pieces in the right places, and really truly interacts with me while we're together. Before bed we both tidied up the blocks; Riku is very meticulous and we have to pull apart every single block. If he spots one that has two together it is taken apart immediately and then goes back into the box. He takes this cleaning up quite seriously and we finish in no time! He is such a loving, funny, and sweet little boy.  </p>
<p>Dinner was delicious as always, and Riku ate a nice sized portion as well as two plums for dessert. I had three wedges of it and was perfectly content. Right after dinner, Bryn ran Riku's bath, and I sat on the floor besdie the tub, while he happily played with all the plastic containers he found in the drawer. He had a funnel and we played together with that, filling up containers and letting it run over his shoulders and back. "Ahhhhh" says Riku when I do this. I washed his hair and gave him a few more minutes to finish up before getting him all lotioned up and into his pj's. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane were lying on the bed as I did this, and as I had carried Riku into the bedroom all snuggled up in his towel (as I always do), he pretended he was a baby!, with little wailing sounds, whimpering, rubbing his eyes... what a character he is! He would even say "I am a baby" and make more sounds; I made nice little soothing sounds at him while rubbing him with his creams and finishing off with a foot and toe massage, which he always likes. </p>
<p>Story time with Nana, and tuck-in time with Mommy, later than was planned... at 9:20 I left for home and Bryn and I could hear Riku still chatting. Bryn's guess was that Akane was asleep though! Oh, tomorrow will not be an easy day at school drop-off for Riku is my guess... and I might be dropping him! </p>
<p>Tomorrow is an Amelia day... and it looks as though it's going to be nice and sunny... hope so. Bed 11:30... too late!</p>
