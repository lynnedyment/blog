								<h2>A Riku, Amelia, Riku Day!</h2>
								<p>Well, today was my turn to take Riku to school and have to leave him there. Bryn has his Japanese class tonight, leaves early and asked if I would mind taking Riku to school so he could get to work a little earlier. No problem, although I wasn't looking forward to seeing him upset. He came down to the car telling me "no teacher, no school" and on the drive there, in between singing bouts, I heard it again as well as "No children!". </p>
<p>We had to park a long two and a half blocks away from the school, so that was fun! We got to "no chase me!" and run and look at a couple of things, but within that final half block Riku wanted up in my arms and started protesting, with a little cry in his voice. It really increased the minute we walked in the door and he clung so hard to me. </p>
<p>One of the teachers brought over the sticker selection for his daily logbook, and he was willing to point to it and stick it in as long as he had one firm hand clinging to my jacket! It took two teachers to get his now-two hands away from my jacket and it was so sad. This has to get better very soon! I left immediately after a kiss and a "see you later" as there was no point at all in prolonging the agony for either of us. It was a tough walk back to the car leaving him like this. </p>
<p>Amelia was to spend the day with me today, as Susan has some appointments. I parked on Fell and they were in the playground waiting for me at 9:30. "Hi Nana!" said Amelia and I was happy to see her too! We stayed there for about forty minutes with Amelia climbing up and down the playhouse; I am astounded at her confidence on the wooden play structure. She shows no fear whatsoever about clambering over and around on anything she can thing of!  Over the course of the time there though she was showing signs she was a tired girl (rubbing her eyes is the giveaway!). We picked up her lunch bag and snacks at the house, and were on our way to Rhode Island Street by 11 a.m. </p>
<p>It was a gorgeous sunny day with a warm breeze, so I opened all four windows a bit and we sang songs all the way home. I gave Amelia some of her lunch early so she wouldn't be starving when she awoke, and I had a vegie burger as well as I hadn't eaten breakfast before leaving this morning. </p>
<p>Amelia was tucked in by noon hour, and went down so very easily... blinds shut, she turned on the "water" sound, snuggled in with a soft blanket and two animals, I walked out the door five minutes later. She slept for two solid hours. I worked on emails for a bit, made a banana bread to send home with Susan and also some gomai, an Asian cold spinach dish we both love. I also thoroughly cleaned my kitchen counters, stove and microwave as I just haven't had much housework time lately! </p>
<p>Amelia and I had a fun afternoon together after she ate a really large lunch; Susan packs such wonderful meals for her... spinach and rice, quiche, a little Indian curry, a selection of cut up fresh fruit, pudding, applesauce, yogurt, tiny pieces of cheese, toast, avocado.. so if she isn't in the mood for one thing there is always something else to offer. She eats very well though, and once she has decided that she has had enough that's it! Not one bite after that "no".</p>
<p>We read some stories, she pushed the "bee" around the house (one of her favourite things to do each time she is here), played "BabyType" on the computer for about ten minutes, and had a big play in the sink too. The time flew by and before I knew it, it was time to walk over to the playground. Susan was going to meet us there at 5:30 after we had had some playtime first. </p>
<p>I stopped by the dry cleaners to see how Lily was doing, as her husband was in the shop. He gave me the most horrific news; on May 8th, Lily was attacked by a man with a knife and she was stabbed about the head and face four times. She had been in the hospital for over a month and had just been released within the last couple of days. I cannot imagine what an awful ordeal this must have been for her! She lay for an hour before her husband found her; his voice was shaking as he told me about it. I cannot imagine how Lily is going to be able to go back into the shop to work ever again. </p>
<p>Amelia and I got to the playground at 4 p.m. and it was so busy with lots of children and their parents. There were lots of little ones Amelia's age, which was lovely for her, and she had such a great time climbing up on the "house" structure, interacting with them, and rushing down the slide... up and down, over and around, busy as busy can be! </p>
<p>I had asked Akane to join us there after Riku's nap, but it took Akane four hours to get from the school and home again. She had a city train driver who wouldn't let her on the streetcar unless Riku was taken out and the stroller folded!, and then stopped for some food and drinks on the way home. A long day for them both... </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Riku had only slept an hour, so was no doubt tuckered out from his busy morning and a too long stroller ride too. Akane arrived at 5:45 and thank goodness the playground no longer closes at 6 p.m. as Riku enjoyed his time running and being active. It was obvious he was tired as he didn't have much patience with the other children, frowning at them if they touched anything he was near. Not typical Riku behavior at all, as he always enjoys company. </p>
<p>Susan and Amelia left at 6 p.m. for home and a bath. Akane left to buy some dinner, the playground emptied out of most of the children and Riku was free to run up and down the ramp, gather up some pretty coloured pieces of paper, and climb with no interference from anyone at all. It really was just what he needed; he was a happy boy. He even let me put him in the stroller; Riku walks home from the park 90% of the time. Akane met us at the corner for the short walk to the house. </p>
<p>As soon as we walked in the door he said "Nana, let's play together!"<br />
It's the first time I've heard that phrase from him... so cute! and so we did, as Akane assembled his dinner plate. We all sat at the table together... Akane had bought me a delicious vegie burrito... with grilled onions, vegies, black beans, and mushrooms... it was sooo good but I ate only half, and told Akane she could offer the rest of it to Bryn after his class. Riku had rice with fish sprinkles, lovely cooked carrots from a stew that Akane had made, some soft tofu, and then extra rice, some Japanese pickles, and more carrots, and then polished off a bowl of strawberry yogurt with flax seed in it! What a nice round belly he had! </p>
<p>As his tub was filling we went back to making our "bulding" higher and higher, and when asked Riku said we would break it "after bathtime". It was a ten minute tub only, as I wanted him ready for bed early, but he had all his plastic tub toys in with him, and we splashed and played with Riku relaxing in the warm water. Again tonight he went into his "I baby" routine after wrapping him in his towel and carrying him into the bedroom for his "massage" and pj time. Akane was lying on the bed as he was doing his baby whimpering and "crying"; he made us both smile as he did his acting job so well. Have no idea what brought this on, but it is adorable. </p>
<p>I read him "Walter the Lazy Mouse" again, and left as Akane walked him into the bedroom for stories with her and a tuck in. Bryn told me that he awoke at 9:30 with a full diaper but went right back to sleep. All that food he packed in tonight had to go somewhere! </p>
<p>It was 8:45 when I walked in the door, twelve and a half hours since I had left to pick Riku up for school. There was another sad message awaiting me. Mrs. Thorne, Marie's mom died unexpectantly of a massive heart attack at 5:30 their time today. Marie was so upset on the machine, saying she would be up for a while, and so I called her back at midnight her time, and we talked for a half hour. It is all so sad and I know it will take Marie a long time to get over it. I think it's harder for her as there wasn't any indication she was in such distress. </p>
<p>In the kitchen, on the counter, was a beautiful bouquet of tightly closed bright orange irisis, already arranged in a vase, and in the fridge was a bag full of goodies... four of my very favourite dishes from Japantown. Susan had stopped in here before going to the playground and left these all for me! </p>
<p>Not much energy for much besides a few emails and this blog; off to bed to start a new book.</p>
