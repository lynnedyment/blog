								<h2>An Ocean Beach Afternoon</h2>
								<p>I could have slept in today, or stayed in bed reading, as Doug is away, but instead I got up at 6 a.m. and got started with my day. I managed to get so many emails written and am happy to report that I am down to just twenty emails, after starting at over 200 when I arrived home nine days ago. Some of them had been answered while I was away but I wrote the hardest ones of all this morning... the ones that have been waiting for an answer for up to six months or more! I will be so happy when I have them all answered and can get back to answering emails when they are less than a week old! </p>
<p>Since Riku is starting school next week, I can't bear the thought of missing out on our full days together. I made plans with Akane last night to pick Riku up at 11 a.m. today and I was there right on the nose. That beaming little face of his lights up my day; he likes to hold hands almost the whole way home now. We did stop to say hello to Lily at the dry cleaner's but someone else was there and told us that Lily is sick right now. Riku hasn't seen her since we got back from Japan and I could see he was a little disappointed. As always, we took our time walking back here, so that Riku could explore anything and everything that interests him... the ladder at the "burned" house, the window truck outside the new house being built on the next block, and any dog or cat who happens by. </p>
<p>Today was a little off track as Riku wasn't hungry for a late breakfast or an early lunch today. Akane says his appetite has slowed down a bit, and it's true that he isn't quite so eager to sit and eat right now. We waited until 1 p.m. and then he ate well, but still in smaller quantities than has been true for the last month or more. He was also tired though, which contributes to this, so I packed up for our anticipated trip to Ocean Beach, which I had promised him would happen today. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep before I drove ten blocks; I drove right to Ocean Beach, found a quiet parking spot, pulled out my book, rolled down the windows and sat there for another hour and forty-minutes while Riku napped. He woke up very briefly at one point, so I drove down the "Great Highway" for five minutes and returned to our spot, reading and dozing off a bit myself. The sun was warm and just right for a little snoozing. </p>
<p>Susan and Amelia pulled up beside us before Riku woke up; Amelia had had a two and a half hour nap earlier in her stroller so they went off to buy us a cold drink. By the time they returned, Riku and I were on the beach with his sand toys. Riku is so very happy to sit in one spot playing with containers and shovels, and Miss Amelia is happy to sit as close to him as she possibly can, making it impossible for him to do a thing! </p>
<p>This is the funniest thing to see; Amelia is clear about her needs and then Riku has to figure out how to get her off him... it's adorable. We can distract Amelia for a few minutes but she sees her place as being right there with him. Amelia is a girl who knows what she wants and goes for it; it will be very interesting one day in the future to see how many fellows she brings home! </p>
<p>Amelia also likes to wander about on the beach, which keeps Susan very busy chasing after her. Today she was running, saying "I'm going to catch you, I'm going to catch you!" and Riku was smiling as he watched them, repeating to me "she's going to catch you". Not much later I was running after a squealing Riku, and then we switched so that Susan was running after Riku and I after Amelia. It was great fun; they found a big hole in the sand, watched some parasailors taking off, and found interesting feathers and sticks on their meanderings. The sand was blowing and it was a bit cooler than would have been ideal for me (I should have taken a light jacket) but it was really wonderful to be out in the air with nothing to do but enjoy the children and the big waves. </p>
<p>At 6 p.m. we left for home. Riku seemed just a little dozy as we started out, all that sun and exercise did their job, but I didn't want him sleeping so close to his bed time... so I sang song after song, with him making suggestions when I hesitated as to what the next one should be..."song about barn and chicken?', "song about mouse on clock?" and even "alliagtor song" which Bryn told me later is the one song he tends to sing to Riku. He was a happy little fellow when we pulled in the driveway. Doug was home from his trip earlier than he planned to be, so I asked him to blow up the pool a little more; Riku "helped" and then the two of them took a hammer and using a hammer broke up a pottery pot that was cracked. Riku quite enjoyed this! We were no sooner back in the door though when there was an IM from Bryn saying he was on his way from work to pick Riku up! Riku and I dashed upstairs for some time with his blocks and figurines... firemen tonight. </p>
<p>Thank goodness Doug was busy downloading photos as Bryn wanted to see the ones from the day before, when the children were "wrestling" on the bed. He took the time to see lots of others too, so Riku had a little more time here before he left for dinner. I carried him down to his car seat as that seems to make it a little easier to say goodbye on those days when he wouldn't mind just a little more time here. Bryn had bought him four new books and I waved goodbye to a happy little boy looking at one of them. </p>
<p>Later Bryn IM'd that Riku's saying "after" now, as in: "This one now, this one after." Nice concept to have... </p>
<p>Doug and I had a quick dinner of a vegie burger, and some carrot and celery sticks to munch on later, as we watched a video. Riku called at 9 p.m. to say goodnight though which was so wonderful. He was on the phone when I picked him up and we had a little chat before he hung up, saying "goodnight honey" and "see you 'morrow" in that sweet voice. What a lovely tradition this would be, a good night call to his Nana!</p>
