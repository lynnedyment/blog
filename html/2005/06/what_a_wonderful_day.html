								<h2>What a Wonderful Day!</h2>
								<p>Ah, I slept until 8:20 a.m., checked my email, took a shower, ate a small breakfast of toast and cheese, enjoyed my big mug (made by Caillie for me) of perfect hot chocolate, and headed out the door for a nice long walk with Amelia. It was already sunny with blue skies when I left the house; Kevin had kindly dropped off "Sammy"... the red Honda, for me to use until Doug returns.</p>
<p>I found Susan and Amelia in the playground across the street from their house. Amelia spotted me from the top of the winding slide, gave me that big Amelia smile and scooted down the slide to greet me. We stayed on with Susan for another half hour or so, and at 11 a.m. Amelia and I set out for our walk. It was a little breezy, just the perfect weather for pushing the stroller. Amelia was ready for her nap and was asleep before we reached the end of the Panhandle. </p>
<p>Instead of walking around Stow Lake, our usual destination, I decided to walk to the big lake at the far end of the park. Too often there are people talking loudly around our favourite lake and I wanted Amelia to have a nice long sleep. She slept for an hour and twenty minutes, and would have slept longer except for a very loud gull, complaining when the man feeding him stopped. Amelia did doze off a bit more on the way home and was her happy and hungry self when we walked in the door at 1:30 p.m. </p>
<p>Susan had her lunch all ready, of course, and I stayed on for a few minutes amazed at how many different foods Amelia will eat... whole beans... kidney beans in Kevin's homemade chili today, pinto and black beans yesterday. Bryn told me she ate quite a spicy curry one night too! </p>
<p>Home for lunch for me... a big green salad with a can of flaked tuna in it, followed by a big cup of tea. I called Akane at 3:15, hoping to get Riku just up from his nap for a trip to the playground, but there was no answer; I sent Akane an email letting her know I would be happy to walk him over and have her join us as it is such a beautiful day. While waiting, I worked on my emails for a bit, writing to Carol, Don, Glenn, and Judith. </p>
<p>I was just heading upstairs with the ironing board to get at Riku's little shirts (I do love ironing these!) when Sheldon called. His email server hasn't been accepting my emails and he wondered what was up; we also caught up on the family news... Don's new job, which he hadn't heard about, Harry serving in the Middle East, etc. and had a nice long talk. It's been a while since we had time to touch base. </p>
<p>I had told Susan this afternoon that I would be happy to either babysit Amelia at their place tonight, or have her over here for another sleepover. I left it in her court, and she called to say that she had packed up and was heading for our playground. At 5 p.m. Bryn let me know that Akane was up, so I called and said I would be right over. Riku and Akane were downstairs waiting for me, Riku with big yellow pail and some shovels in hand.</p>
<p>Lots of plans made... Bryn and Kevin were meeting us at the playground at 6:15, Akane may join us, and Susan would be there after picking up a few groceries. </p>
<p>Riku and I were sitting side my side, with our sandals off, when I spotted Yvonne and Diego... old friends of Kevin's. We had attended Diego's first birthday party in the spring; Yvonne is such a lovely vibrant young woman and it is always a treat to run into her! Diego is taller and slimmer than when I lost saw him and Yvonne is pregnant and due January 25, but is not showing yet. </p>
<p>She was very pleased to hear that Akane, Bryn, Kevin, Susan, and Amelia too would be there soon! Alas, things did not go as planned. Akane did arrive at 6:10; Amelia, however, was too close to being asleep in the car, so Susan brought her right here to give her her dinner. Bryn was chatting with someone at the office and so he and Kevin got there later than they planned to, and so they all missed not only Yvonne and Diego but Kevin's friend, Troy, the dad and husband as well. </p>
<p>Riku had a grand time playing in the sandbox and moving from one to another, playing with all the various toys that the moms are always happy to share. One mom told me about a free music group that meets at the top of Potrero Hill on Fridays so that might be something I could do with Riku this week. </p>
<p>Riku has been accepted into a Japanese summer daycare group, and starts on Monday. He will be there for five weeks, five days a week from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m. I am going to miss my two full days a week with him for sure. It will be impossible to fit in all of our favourite things to do on less than half days, but he will be free all of August. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn are hoping there will be a place for him there in September if he is part of this group, and I am sure Riku will so enjoy having so many children to play with. He is such a socialble little boy and thrives on lots of activity and good people in his life. </p>
<p>Riku gave Kevin such a BIG hug when he saw him; it was really sweet to see. Much to my surprise he was ready to walk home with Kevin and me, while Bryn and Akane drove. I put him into a construction vehicle and Kevin took a few photos of him, beaming away. Riku wanted to be carried the last couple of blocks home, and kissed my shoulder and my cheek as I carried him. Breaks my heart, he does!... but in a good way. </p>
<p>Arrived at home at 7:15! Susan had fed Amelia and had her in the tub, two things I was hoping to do for Susan on this overnight visit of Amelia's! I warmed her towel for her though, and gave her a little massage with the lotion, which she really enjoys, sat her on the toilet, Kevin put her into her jammies, and we showed her mom and dad how well she spits when she brushes her teeth. </p>
<p>Amelia gave big hugs to her mom and dad (who are going home to eat some fondue and watch a movie they started last night), waved merrily at them through the front window, while standing on the table, and off we went immediately to Riku's room for stories. </p>
<p>Suddenly it dawned on Amelia what was going on, but after the tiniest bit of whimpering for her mommy, she snuggled into my lap and we read two stories... "The Very Quiet Cricket" and a barnyard animal book. I lay beside her for just a few moments, singing very very quietly to her so that she had to listen very carefully to "You're My Honeybunch..." and "Rock-a-Bye Baby"... and stroking her hair. I think she was asleep in less than five minutes. </p>
<p>Oh, just as Susan and Kevin were about to leave, Glenna called with the news that she is a grandmother to a little girl! Sharif and his wife are the parents of Jasmine, born last Thursday, at seven pounds and 21" in length! They drove to Toronto to see her; Sharif is over the moon, reports his mom, and tomorrow night Glenna is on her way to Paris with Mostafa. If we don't manage to talk more tomorrow we shall catch up in ten days. How exciting this news is! </p>
<p>I made myself a delicious bowl of fruit and yogurt for me dinner; it was too late for anything heavier and really hit the spot. Susan had brought over some lovely organic apricots which were perfect with the strawberries and bananas I had planned to eat. </p>
<p>Amelia report... awake for less than one minute at 9 p.m. I told her it was still sleepy time and that she was to hold the dog and go back to sleep. This happened at 10 p.m. too and worked like a charm once again... wow! I'm off to wash and get into my pj's just in case I get to bed a little earlier than I plan to, but so far so good. This is just such fun... it's something I have looked forward to. I get to see that first big smile of the day and all those Amelia "hi!"s. </p>
<p>Riku will be joining us for playtime early tomorrow too... can't wait!</p>
