								<h2>Celebrating Tom's First Day of Retirement</h2>
								<p>Gail and Tom were both still sleeping when I awoke at 8:30 today; Gail was up soon after and Tom not much later. They went to bed at 2 a.m., after a very successful party (but with tears too), last night at the ferry terminal on Tom's last watch ever. </p>
<p>Tom wanted to celebrate his first day off by buying us brunch at a restaurant they had never tried before... "The Old Dutch Inn"; the waitresses wear Dutch costumes, complete with hats, but not wooden shoes... a little disappointing. We had a later start then intended, so were all more than ready for food at 1 p.m. Gail and I shared grilled gouda sandwiches and an egg salad sandwich, both with fries, and a big pot of tea. Tom and Doug had an egg dish, one with ham and one with gouda cheese, with fries on the side as well. Our window seat came with a lovely view of the water. </p>
<p>Turns out that Jody and Hal's place was just around the corner and two blocks away, so that was our next stop. We did the grand tour, starting with the lovely gardens, which I hadn't walked around in the rain yesterday. Jody served her delicious coconut cake, we took some photos outside, and within an hour were on our way to Coombe's. </p>
<p>There was a goat on the roof, but the grass is high and we don't think they have been very busy up there. We puttered about there for a bit, buying a few gifts and resisting the coconut ice cream. </p>
<p>Stopped for an hour at Costco to have Gail's films developed, bought some camisoles, and looked at the photos of Tom's first retirement event while driving to Etta's with bananas for her. She showed Doug around the retirement home, and we sat once again and looked at the last of the photos of Japan. Etta had been reading the blogs Gail printed out for her so she was very happy to see some of what she had read about. </p>
<p>Home after 7:30; Gail made Doug and Tom dinner... vegie hot Italian "sausages" on whole wheat rosemary (fabulous!) rolls, with potato salad, radishes, and olives, while I made the two of us a bowl of fruit salad and yogurt. An hour of "The Nanny", tea, cards, a load of laundry, some tv for Tom, computering for Doug, and our evening came to a close... after a relaxing day out. Bed for me at 11:30... but not sleeping at 12:30 a.m.</p>
