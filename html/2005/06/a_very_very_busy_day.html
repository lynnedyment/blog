								<h2>A Very Very Busy Day!</h2>
								<p>What a very successful first night away from home for Amelia! Except for one tiny calling out for her Mommy during the night Amelia slept right through until 7:20. I was lying next to her waiting for her eyes to open. She was so sweet; gave me a big smile, leaned over for a big kiss, and sat up ready for her day. It could not have been a better night; I immediately left Susan an email, but then phoned her after seeing her message saying she was awake and headed for the shower half an hour earlier. Unfortunately, Susan's sleep was not quite as successful as Amelia's as she is so used to waking often during the night. One day... however, she and Kevin got to watch a whole movie at home, uninterrupted, had a quiet dinner, although the house seemed awfully quiet to them!, and enjoyed their evening together. </p>
<p>Amelia played in the bathroom with some wooden toys while I showered and then we went down to dress her for this cool and overcast day. Too bad, as the pool is filled waiting for sunshine. Bryn dropped Riku off just after 8:30 and we sat down for breakfast a little while after that. They both had strawberries and toast, and Amelia had a yogurt too. Riku was a little tired, up too late last night, so Bryn wasn't sure if he would eat much or be inclined to play happily with Amelia, but they had a great time together. </p>
<p>Seeing that little blonde and Riku's dark head together is the sweetest thing. He is taller and stockier than Amelia but she takes the lead in giving him big bear hugs, not always welcomed!, and many kisses too, which he seems just fine with. I think it is the Nelson hold that he objects too, with the back of his shirt being held firmly while she wrestles him down for the hug that bothers him the most! Yes, a little refereeing is necessary at times. She is not being mean to him, just a little more assertive that young Riku is used to at this stage of his life. </p>
<p>We had a busy morning; they drew at the table, played side by side in the sink, sharing their pouring containers and little cups, we sat and read on the sofa, and they sat on Riku's bed with all of his cars spread out, playing very nicely indeed with those too. </p>
<p>Riku walked up and down the stairs to our room many times today by holding on to the railing only. Up to now he has always crawled down backwards, which is a much more comfortable position for me to handle, watching him! But he is growing up I suppose and he is a very cautious little boy; I still want to be there when he is doing this though and so far, so good. No doubt Amelia will be barrelling down in no time, adding grey hairs to my head; the child has no fear. Egad! </p>
<p>Susan arrived at 11:30 a.m. with a little fellow Sylvan, whom she is babysitting today for a neighbour. He is very cute; big blue eyes with some green in the centre and a smile that spreads and spreads. Riku was quite taken with him, and gave him lots of little hugs and attention... handing him a rattle or shaking it for him, just as he did for his cousin Haruka in Japan. Amelia was very maternal with him too, leaning on him to give him kisses and then gently hugging him when he protested with the hugs. </p>
<p>Well, I won't detail our day and how busy we were... it was just crazy at times, with both Sylvan and Amelia crying, both needing their naps, and Sylvan fussing each time he was put down while Susan and I got lunch ready for them. How one little person can throw a whole routine off is just amazing, but as Susan said, we didn't adjust slowly over the past seven months of his life and that makes a big difference. We were both very happy to have the extra set of hands around! </p>
<p>Susan took Sylvan in a front baby carrier and Amelia in her stroller for a walk in the drizzle. Riku was down for his nap at 1 p.m. and slept until 2:15. He was ready for some quiet time with his Nana, and we sat on the bed reading story after story until he had has his share of me. Snack time... grapes and strawberries with some cheese and toast. </p>
<p>The house was busy once again with snacks for Amelia and filling up Sylvan who just ate and ate and ate... applesauce, carrots, squash and his bottle. Bryn and Kevin both called to see how things were going and we were delighted to hear they are both planning on being home a little earlier tonight. </p>
<p>Bryn asked if I would babysit Riku tonight while they went out to use a birthday gift certificate from us; I was more than happy to do so, as it gave me a little more time with Riku. We said goodbye to Amelia, Susan, and Sylvan at 5:30, and at 6 p.m. Bryn picked us up for the drive home (still raining). </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn left almost immediately so Riku and I got busy making a spinach and cheese omelette for him, with a whole slice of toast and some fresh tomatoes. He had strawberry sorbet for dessert and we talked about the gelato we had in Japan. </p>
<p>Riku then helped me with the dishes and he really helped! He did the washing and just needed a little supervision with the sponge on the plates but he rinsed the dishes under the tap as though he's been doing it for ages. He has been helping, I know, but he is a quick learner, taking it all very seriously. </p>
<p>Tub time after that; Riku wanted all of his tub toys, which was fine with me. I taught him how to fill a little whale which then meant he could aim it to squirt a long stream of water right at me! He laughed and laughed and so did I; he is so funny now as he will comment on what we are doing... "Riku squirting Nana! Nana laughing! Funny!"</p>
<p>The other day he was talking with wee Bryn on the phone; Bryn must have said something funny to Riku, as he laughed, and then told Bryn "Riku laughing"! as though Bryn wouldn't know that. </p>
<p>He also told me that there was a whale in Nana's yard too, which there is, of course, as the whale pool is taking up a big space in it now. He is quite the little conversationalist these days and it's such fun. </p>
<p>I washed his hair and he then washed his baby's hair, telling her "stay calm, stay calm" (first time I have heard this from him) or "it's okay". Riku is a little nervous about getting water in his eyes, and this is his way of letting us know to be very careful, although it has been a long time since he fussed while I washed his hair. In Japan I washed it in the kitchen sink while he lay flat on the counter; this worked well too and is how I used to wash his daddy's hair.  </p>
<p>The usual nighttime routine followed... a big snuggle with the towel wrapped around him, and then keeping his upper body covered while applying lotion to the lower half (I don't like being chilled after my shower so just assume he doesn't either), then pj's, teeth (with some valiant spitting attempts), and then story time... "Walter the Lazy Mouse" tonight; we just went through each page while Riku commented on what was happening. We also talked about going to the park tomorrow afternoon if it isn't raining, although Bryn told me Riku's Japanese nanny will take him in the morning if the weather allows it. </p>
<p>Riku took a little longer to settle tonight; twenty minutes instead of the usual ten, but I could see he was working towards drifting off and he did a great job. </p>
<p>I put on the kettle for hot water, instead of tea, and sat drinking it while catching up on yesterday's and starting today's blog. Bryn insisted on driving me home, even though it wasn't raining and I was looking forward to the short walk; I wasn't out all day today or yesterday for any exercise at all... but I was escorted home and am now off to bed.</p>
