								<h2>A Lovely Busy Day Out</h2>
								<p>After the most sleepless night of my life, I believe... awake until almost 4 a.m. and awake at 7:45, the day was a very satisfying one. Gail and I had a lazy morning, with cards, tea and my hot water, and a half of a banana each!, we went off for lunch with Tom and Doug. Gail made massage reservations for us for Saturday before we left so we have that to look forward to. </p>
<p>Lunch was booked for 12:30 at "McLean's" in downtown Nanaimo. We ate at this wonderful little restaurant last year too. Gail was hoping they would have their most delicious cream of mushroom soup today; she was very disappointed she didn't have any for lunch yesterday, so I called to find out what the soup was. Mushroom it was, but told her it was cauliflower and cheese; what a nice surprise for her when the waitress told us that the soup de jour was mushroom! </p>
<p>Gail and I both love dunking good bread in good cream soup, and dunk we did. We ordered a crusty panini roll and an order of their homemade focaccia and shared them. Perfect! ... and we cleaned out every last bit of our bowls with the bread. Doug and Tom had soup as well, and both had bread pudding for dessert, Doug's with custard. As we sat at the window table having lunch, Hal, Jody's husband, tapped on the window and came over to say hello; he was there to pick up three loaves of the focaccia for the B&B guests (although he hoped that he would get to eat some too!). They went off book hunting while Gail and I sat and enjoyed a big pot of tea, complete with cozy, and two small scones each with Devon cream and raspberry jam. </p>
<p>We all went off to the post office to mail some parcels and cards; Tom and Doug went off to more bookstores, while Gail and I went into the casino (leaving soon thereafter as the machines just were not co-operating) and then poked into some local stores. Nice to just wander about, not in a rush to go anywhere, and walk off the scones. </p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon was spent in various stores and malls as we all had some things we wanted to buy. Doug pointed out a coconut Roger's chocolate to me as I left a card store, so of course I could not resist that, and Gail bought a couple of birthday gifts. Doug and I were looking for an electric grill like Gail and Tom have; I especially would love to roast vegetables and "burgers" on it, and tofu too. Decided to try to find it in the States instead, as well as a small pool for the patio that we could set up for the Amelia and Riku this summer.</p>
<p>Arrived home about 7 p.m. Kelly had left an IM message for me; it has been about five weeks since I have had much contact with her and it was just wonderful "chatting" with her and catching up on her news and sharing mine with her. They have laid sod in the backyard!, are having a big barbecue party on Saturday for old friends of Gregg's, and everyone sounds happy and well. Caillie has had her hair cut short! Can't wait to see the photo that Kelly promised to send out in a day or two. </p>
<p>I felt a little guilty chatting on the computer as I had intended to wash the little pototoes for dinner while Gail prepared the asparagus. However, she was very organized, had the potatoes steaming away when I joined her in the kitchen, the wild salmon steaks on her indoor grill, and the asparagus already grilled and on a plate.... what a perfectly wonderful dinner we had! </p>
<p>Becky and Wayne had given Gail a jar of caramel sauce with cranberries for Christmas, and Gail had been waiting for the perfect occasion to open it. Wow! What a treat, served over vanilla Haagen-Dazs ice cream. Tom resisted (he was going off to a fellow ferry worker's retirement shift) although he did open a bottle of wine for the two of us to share over dinner. </p>
<p>Candy called with the results of a test done last week; she has flying colours on her blood work! but also had xrays done on her neck and spine. We had some good laughs before hanging up; Gail was busy with laundry after they chatted for a bit. </p>
<p>Cards and tea, and some quiet time reading on the sofa before reading my emails... a wonderful long one from Bryn with lots of Riku information for me! and another from Don, saying he and Beth have just signed the papers for a new home! ...</p>
<p>And now...  off to bed at 11:20 p.m. It was a perfectly wonderful day.</p>
