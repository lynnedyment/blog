								<h2>Tuesday Already!</h2>
								<p>Awoke at 8:30 today, not too late considering how late I went to bed this morning! Uncle Frank and I were competing for the shower at the same time today, the first time this has happened. I took a quick "navy" shower and let him have the hot water to himself downstairs. Ran a couple of washes through, as I had to iron a few blouses to get me through the next couple of days.</p>
<p>I made omelettes today, as we ate a bit late. We did take our time over breakfast which was good as we had a busy morning and early afternoon. While UF continued working on his labels, and spending far too long on the phone with Bell Canada, I packaged up fifteen lots of rhubarb for the freezer, made up two dessert dishes for UF, and then got busy cleaning out the fridge, and cleaning the fridge too. Beth called while I was doing this so I puffed away at her while continuing on; it is humid today so it was a hot job. </p>
<p>I admired UF's labels, which make a huge difference in being easy for him to read now in the dark cabinets. He had to fiddle a bit to get them just right and so is very pleased with the results. I vacuumed the floor after finishing the fridge, folded some laundry, emptied baskets for garbage night tonight, and somehow the afternoon flew by. </p>
<p>Gerry and Lionel picked me up at 3:15 for a trip to Costco. My intention was to buy all the plates, cups, etc. for the Boxing Day party, but it would take years to go through the numbers you have to buy. I'm hoping to do better at the dollar stores, when we get a chance to go. I did find a couple of birthday gifts though, so the trip was worthwhile and gave Gerry and I time to just wander around and catch up. </p>
<p>Back to Gerry's for tea and toast; I got to see lots of photos of her darling one-year-old grandson and his siblings. What a big boy he is... already thirty-five pounds at just a year old! Riku is now thirty pounds at almost three, but Tanner is an especially big boy. </p>
<p>By' was over with UF after work, helping him weed and we had planned to pick up fish and chips and eat at Gerry's. However, when we popped in, By' and UF were still busy raking and pulling weeds, so Gerry and I picked up the dinner and brought it here to eat. Delicious and fast! By' ate with us; Lionel was playing hockey and I threw away a lot of french fries. "A Fine Kettle of Fish" is very generous with their portions! </p>
<p>By' and Gerry left for home around 8:30, UF came back up to the computer to work on the photo we plan to send to Kay in England for identification, and I pulled out the photo boxes I had put away before leaving. And there I sat for two and a half hours, clearing out yet one more big box of photos. </p>
<p>Ian called during this time, and we made arrangements to go over for a visit on Thursday night. Glenn called and chatted with Uncle Frank and then with me. I wanted the name of the wonderful massage therapist Jan introduced me to many years ago; I think UF needs a good massage, and will see if he is game or not. Then I called Amy and Jake and made arrangements to have lunch with Amelia (as Amy prefers to be called now) on Thursday afternoon. Jake promised to make potato cakes tomorrow night, so that we can just heat them up for lunch. Can't wait! And I called and chatted with Marie for a bit too. </p>
<p>Guess I am not going to be in bed at midnight after all, but I am going down to have some port with UF and then shall call it a night. Busy and successful day here, and tomorrow will come early. </p>
<p>Signing off -- 1:15 a.m. -- after sitting with UF drinking our port and going through many, many more photos! One big plastic container now empty, although UF has to make some final decisions tomorrow morning on four big stacks of them. Night night!</p>
