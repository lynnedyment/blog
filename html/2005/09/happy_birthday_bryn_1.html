								<h2>Happy Birthday, Bryn!</h2>
								<p>Today is Bryn's 11th birthday, which seems far too close to teenagehood to me! He is over at his Dad's today and will no doubt have had apple pie for his "cake" and dinner with Hans, Caillie, and his Uncle Mark. We celebrated together on Saturday, and I had an ecard for him to receive today. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this morning brought such sad news from Zoë in the U.K. Graham, her beloved partner, died of an apparently unexpected and massive heart attack three days ago. I cannot imagine how devasted Zoë and her children must be, and how unimaginable it is that Graham is no longer with us in the world.</p>
<p>Uncle Frank said tonight that it is easy to get lots done when you have a twenty-hour day, and that was very close to the truth! We started our day off with a simple breakfast of cereal, strawberries, toast, and tea. Uncle Frank had some computer work to do before we started in on what we had agreed was of utmost importance today... the infamous "headbump" space. I made a corn and vegetable chowder, using up the four ears of corn, a green pepper, some new red potatoes, and onions, and left it simmering on the stove while we worked. </p>
<p>The boxes of Christmas decorations were to be tackled and we did it, although it took a couple of hours. There were more than eight large Rubbermaid containers filled to the brim with garlands, linens, decorations, candles, and holders, each carefully labeled with the room they were to go in. Uncle Frank went over each item carefully, weeding out the ones he could live without, although it wasn't an easy job to do. He knows, however, that he will never decorate the house the way that Auntie Rita did. There were two artificial trees, mugs, platters, etc., which Beth said she would take, along with strings of lights as well as much of the above. </p>
<p>We stopped for lunch and had the leftover quesadillas from last night along with the soup. I gathered up all the items needing delivery today and off we went, with tapes, a book, and photos to the Legion, our first stop. One of the women there asked if I were Rita Massard's sister, and that was before she saw Uncle Frank! This happened last year as well, with a different woman. Uncle Frank got a big hug from Helen, one of the women in the office who was very fond of Auntie Rita. </p>
<p>From there we went to the doctor, for a referral to a specialist for Uncle Frank. He is very fond of Dr. Gill, his M.D., and hopes to have an appointment soon to check out once again if there is a possible solution to his leg problem. </p>
<p>We drove all over town after that, it seems... all the way to Stamford Green to drop off several boxes at the Goodwill, to the post office to mail the photos to Gail and Candy (and having to repackage them in order not to have to pay "oversize" rates), and over to Beth's to drop off several containers filled to the brim. </p>
<p>I called Gerry from Beth's (she was at work) to see if they were available for dinner tonight. I could hear a little one fussing in the background, and was delighted to learn that Tanner, Yvette's and Jeff's little sixteen month old, was still there with them. We picked up the fish and chips, Gerry had the table set, tea made, and lemon loaf for dessert. I was so happy to be there catching up on what was new in their lives. Tanner, however, was the main attraction. He is really darling, very affectionate, put his head on my shoulder almost immediately, sat at the table with us eating chick-peas, and pushing all the buttons on his ride-on toy. He was a tired fellow when we finished eating at 6:30, so off we went as we had lots to do at home. </p>
<p>We went right to work; I put UF's summer shirts in one closet and his winter shirts in another, while he went through his winter clothes and did a good toss-out. </p>
<p>Then UF started clearing out his office closet; we took photos out of frames, which went in the "donate" pile, got rid of lots of paper work no longer necessary to keep, put office supplies on the cleared shelves, and as a result found another bin of photos! No time for this bin while I am here this trip, but UF may work his way through them over the next few months.</p>
<p>I called to say goodnight to Riku; he was coughing badly and still sounding pretty under-the-weather. This cold has really been holding on; it must be taking its toll on him. </p>
<p>Can't wait to get home and see both Riku and Amelia. I know they will both have changed too much... all those lost photo ops! </p>
<p>Uncle Frank cleared out a drawer in his room so there was room for his winter sweatshirts; I got those all washed today and freshened up for him. Out with the shorts and on with the warm woolies! </p>
<p>Next, I thought it would be wise to start off with the birthdays UF needed for his online birthday reminder. We started currently, and went forward right through January and onto next fall. It took us over three hours(!) but we finished it, very very late... 1:30 a.m.  And finally it was time to sit down with our port, and do what I have been looking forward to all day... go through the box of Neal's memorabilia I had discovered last night. We said goodnight at 4:30 a.m... and then I sat reading, and went through some more photos; I was pretty wired by that time and finally turned the light out at 5:45... crazy!</p>
