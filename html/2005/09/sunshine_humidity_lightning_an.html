								<h2>Sunshine, Humidity, Lightning, and Rain</h2>
								<p>Busy morning, busy afternoon, and an evening out. Kelly drove to school at 8:30 with Manitou, picking up another dog there, and driving to Don Valley for a three mile run with them both. </p>
<p>I decided to get the birthday gifts wrapped for both Kelly and Bryn, which meant getting into my huge suitcase and sorting through it. It took longer than I thought, and then I got to work on the first of the two living room windows; getting the screen back in was a challenge, but with Kelly's help we did it. One more to do, but it will wait until tomorrow. </p>
<p>Only Caillie and Bryn were home for lunch today; Myk' and Bry' had theirs at school. I had the second half of the roti Mark had picked up for me on Tuesday, and then we drove Caillie to school (Bryn had left earlier on his own to play with friends), continuing on to return three of Caillie's birthday gifts (too small!) and do our Costco shopping as well. It was lots of fun; we were efficient as we had only two and a half hours in total. I found a pair of pants for Bryn's birthday and restocked them on pistachio nuts since everyone loves them. </p>
<p>Arrived back home at 2:50, unpacked the van, got most of the groceries away, changed clothes, and dashed off to the subway at 3:25 to catch the 4:10 Go train to Oakville. Carol picked me up at 4:40. It had been sunny and humid during the day, then threatened rain, but looked as though it might blow over. Kelly suggested that I take a rain jacket along with me, but it was so hot that I couldn't imagine needing it. I did carry an umbrella though. </p>
<p>Good thing, as it started to rain as Carol and I walked to a new-to-us restaurant in Oakville called "Paradiso". It was great and we will go there again for sure; it wasn't too crowded and so we were able to sit for four-plus hours visiting and eating. We shared the lightest gnocchi I think I have ever had, with a very good tomato sauce, and shared Carol's dish of phyllo pastry layered with eggplant, zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta cheese, with a tomato sauce as well. We went through two baskets of their very good bread, with oil and vinegar, shared a delicious pumpkin cheesecake, and sat over tea and coffee until it was time to leave for my 9:30 train back to Toronto. Carol had photos of her two grandchildren with her, and we caught up with what has been going on in our lives. She has had two deaths in the family in a month, and life is very busy for her right now. I had a window view and quite enjoyed the sheet lightning flashing across the sky for three hours. </p>
<p>It did pour hard on our way to the car, but it was dry in Toronto, thank goodness, as I walked home at 10:45 p.m. Gregg was already in bed, and Kelly washing when I walked in. </p>
<p>Bryn had sent through a URL for the photo albums he has been working on, but unfortunately I couldn't access them through the computer downstairs. That, and a phone call to Riku, will have to wait until tomorrow. Bed at midnight...</p>
