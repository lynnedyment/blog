								<h2>Niagara Falls to the Severn...</h2>
								<p>Uncle Frank and I were both awake at 8:30 this morning, showering and dressing immediately in anticipation of our trip up north. We packed up, and checked our list of items to take with us... water, grapes, pillows, the two melons we bought a couple of days ago, cameras, extra clothes, rain jackets, my veggie burgers, etc. </p>
<p>Frank, Glenn's friend, was here cutting UF's lawn and we had a little chat with him about gas, which is what everyone is talking about right now. We heard that gas was up to $1.59 a litre north of Toronto so we're happy we filled up a couple of days ago. UF paid $1.01 last week for his gas. </p>
<p>We had a couple of errands to run... port, the bank, a stop for UF's cane, a couple of photos beside the car, and so left the Falls at 12:15, later than we planned, but in a relaxed and unhurried way for both of us. UF is very happy to have a driver and plans to hire me, for the price of a drink or two! </p>
<p>We couldn't have asked for a more perfect day for this trip. The weather was ideal, the traffic light; we had Isaac Stern playing (a new set UF hadn't listened to yet), and we chatted away about the scenery. We missed our turn to the 407 east; it came up quickly and we took half an hour finding our way back again, after someone gave us the wrong advice. We did top up with gas though; we were not quite halfway empty, and it cost $35. UF chuckled and said he thought he might be able to fill his tank for only $80 or so! </p>
<p>Barrie is a much bigger place than either of us imagined it to be, and UF had decided we should not arrive at the trailer hungry. We stopped at a huge mall and ate at Harvey's, both of us ordering a fully loaded veggie burger, green salad, and coffee for him and tea for me. We couldn't eat our salads, and so Wendy added those to our salad bowl for dinner that evening. </p>
<p>We reached the trailer at 3:45, having made very good time despite our two stops and late departure. Frank had called Glenn to let him know when we left so he wouldn't be worrying about us. What a beautiful spot they have there! Their lot is the biggest in the park, wide with lots of trees and right on the water. UF has his own wee bedroom, with a double bed!, I slept on the comfortable pull-out, both of us with water views. We took a slow walk to a very pretty bridge over the water, just around the corner from their trailer, and I got lots of pics of UF and Glenn standing looking at the views. </p>
<p>We sat outside on lawn chairs, chatting with Stephanie and John. Steph' went off in a rented kayak and we took photos of her, enjoyed cups of tea, eventually getting our light jackets so we could continue sitting outside. It is a gorgeous spot and we just leaned back in our chairs and enjoyed it all. </p>
<p>Wendy and Glenn set up the table in the front sitting room area, so that we had a water view while eating. Glenn barbecued the biggest steaks I have ever seen; Wendy made delicious garlic mashed pototoes, steamed broccoli, tossed a big green salad, and served three other salads as well... pasta, bean, and carrot. Dinner was very filling so we held off on dessert until later on. Wendy and I did the dishes, and we all went outside to enjoy the fire in the firepit... the evening was cool, and the fire felt wonderful. Steph', John, and I toasted marshmallows... it has been years since I ate one, and we laughed at John, who had found a stick long enough that he could roast his while sitting on the deck. </p>
<p>Neighbours joined us a little later on; the conversation was light and lively. The neighbour collects hot wheels and told us about how he got started and how valuable they are if still in their original boxes.. and how appalled he was when the ones he gave two nephews got opened up to play with! New ones... yes, but valuable if left in the boxes. </p>
<p>They are a very nice couple and talked with Glenn about the election taking place tomorrow for the new board for the park. Glenn is running, although seriously hoping not to win a seat. He feels at least this way he can complain about any decision he's not happy with. </p>
<p>Wendy served key lime pie and cookies and cream cake with tea a little later. We watched the stars come out, so beautiful up here, and UF identified the big dipper from his chair. It rained for about two minutes, although I was under the thickest part of the huge oak tree and so didn't get a drop on me. </p>
<p>The fire was burning down and the night air getting cooler, so we went inside to the front living area. This is a <strong>big</strong> trailer! and doesn't feel like one at all. UF and I read the papers I had brought with us, we all watched some of the New Orleans flooding coverage, Wendy and the two "kids" played cards, and the evening ended with a very relaxed crew on board. </p>
<p>At 1:15 a.m. Wendy and I headed for bed, and I was in bed reading before everyone else did the same. I understood the next day that lights were out at 2 a.m...  a long and very relaxing day.</p>
