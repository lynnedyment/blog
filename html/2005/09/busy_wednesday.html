								<h2>Busy Wednesday...</h2>
								<p>Well, I had a rude awakening this morning; the doorbell rang at 8:45 and it was the plumber. I had mentioned to Lionel that UF needed Jack to look at the bathroom tap, they apparently played hockey together last night, and he didn't let any time slide by. UF was still sleeping and continued to for another hour and a half. He was very surprised to waken to a working tap, although actually wanted the downstairs taps looked at as well. </p>
<p>We had a long list of errands to run today, and after our showers and a late breakfast, we made sure we had everything together for this outing... altogether we went to the bank, took back $87 in coins UF had rolled, went to two dollar stores to buy supplies for the Boxing Day sale, dropped off a trunkful of goodies to the Goodwill store, discovered a CD store where UF could sell off cds he no longer wants, went to the liquor store for port and a tall slim bottle of a light white wine, UF bougth a great lightweight Tilly hat that looks wonderful on him, stopped for a sandwich at a new-to-us deli sharing a tomato, cheese, and lettuce on a delicious soft ww roll, and an Italian orange drink (we will go there again; it's a terrific place with homemade everything!), went on to a stationery store for a stamp, and quarter coin rollers, and our last stop was at a men's store in the Square where I talked UF into buying a terrific Tilley hat for himself. Lionel had one on the other day, which looked so good on him. It was in a lighter fabric than the older canvas hats, and had a narrow brim, both of which UF prefers. I had told him about it, and since we were right there, and he really does need a decent hat, in we went. It took some persuation, as Auntie Rita objected to most of the summer hats in his collection, but after trying on several styles, he found one he quite liked. I liked it a lot and thought he looked very dapper in it, and now he has a hat that is guaranteed for life, and even has some insurance against loss. UF thinks he might just test this out by going down to the Falls on a windy day! </p>
<p>We dashed home to have a cup of tea after stopping at the Italian bakery on Sheldon Street, to buy some half ww Italian bread. I couldn't resist two Empire biscuits and two chewy cereal/oatmeal cookies too. Guess I was hungry. I did manage to resist though as it was too close to mealtime. </p>
<p>Sheldon and Donna had invited us for dinner at a restaurant, but before leaving their house we took some photos of them beside the sign in their yard that used to hang outside of the store that Mom and Dad ran. I was so happy to see it, and it is in a great spot on the back of the garage facing a lovely new stone patio. Their home is just beautiful, inside and out, and shows the care and time they have given it over the years. </p>
<p>We drove together to "Mick 'n Angelo's" on the lane for dinner. I had been here with AR and UF a few years ago, and then with UF last January and really enjoyed my meals there. UF did as well, and we were certainly not disappointed tonight. Donna suggested we order their garlic/cheese bread, and some stuffed mushrooms for appetizers. UF and I decided to share an entree of cheese-filled canneloni, and a green salad. Great choice! It was all so good and I ate one of the mushrooms even though I usually avoid seafood; this had shrimp, crab, and two different white fish. UF liked these so much he plans to go in on his own for dinner one night to order just the mushrooms and a slice of bread to soak up the juices. </p>
<p>We went back to Donna's and Shel's for "tea" but ended up with glasses of milky iced Godiva white chocolate liqueur. It was just wonderful, as we sipped away and chatted and laughed over our telling of our port and ice wine adventures. Donna ordered us to go home eventually as she said she couldn't take any more laughing. We had such a fun evening, but Shel' and Donna did have to get up in the morning, while UF and I could sleep as late as we pleased. At 10:30 p.m. we said goodnight and drove home, intending to get to bed early. Hah! It never happens and we sat up while UF had his Sleepytime tea, once again sorting through photos and getting hooked on getting through just one more envelope! </p>
<p>At 1 a.m. we said goodnight... and then I had trouble sleeping. I read, turned out the light, started thinking about supplies for Boxing Day!, and finally got up to take the Rescue Remedy drops I so strongly recommend to everyone else. They did the trick...</p>
