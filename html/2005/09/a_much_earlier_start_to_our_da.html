								<h2>A Much Earlier Start to our Day!</h2>
								<p>This morning Uncle Frank and I were both awake at 6:30 a.m., and then drifted off until 8:30. Breakfast was over at just past 10 a.m., a great improvement over yesterday. We sat chatting over our cereal, with blueberries and flax seed, toast, and tea, until almost noon and then got to work.</p>
<p>The "headbump" was our first mission of the day, clearing out a few more items from the storage area downstairs. We accomplished quite a lot before our backs demanded to be allowed to remain upright, and added lots to our pile that was quickly collecting in the kitchen and front hall way. The last two storage boxes contained photographs, hundreds of them, many of which Auntie Rita had carefully sorted into various categories. We made many piles on the kitchen table, for Gail and Tom, Candy and Rick, my family, the Legion, By's family, Neal, etc. We worked steadily at this for two plus hours before Uncle Frank's eyes grew weary. We did stop from time to time for an interesting story to be told though. I was in my element, as not only were we working with photos, but we were tossing lots of them out too; blurry photos, duplicates, unknown faces, etc. did not make the cut. Flylady would have been very proud of us today! </p>
<p>Glenn called in the morning, inviting us to go to his trailer north of Barrie, about a three hour drive from here. I wasn't sure UF would be game for this but with no hesitation at all said sure! I haven't been there and am looking forward to the time with Glenn, Wendy, Steph', and her boyfriend John. John was here at one time painting a couple of windows for UF and unsticking the kitchen window he painted last week. </p>
<p>We decided we needed a break, so tidied up a bit and went off to a local grocery store for their sale on soup and grapes, and picked up a couple of melons as well. It was just a gorgeous day today, sunny and not quite so hot again, but crystal clear and wonderful. UF suggested a ride to Fonthill via the back roads, and what a treat this was. I drove down roads I have never travelled before, admiring the beautiful old Ontario brick and frame homes, the huge 16-acre lots, the tidy farms, and the narrow treed lanes. We stopped for a basket of peaches (UF has been very disappointed in the peaches this year), and hope they will ripen nicely for us. He hasn't had a "standing over the sink to eat" peach yet this summer. </p>
<p>On the way home we stopped at "Keith's" for a light dinner. This is the spot where Doug's parents often stopped for lunch and "sky high pie" on their way to Sandy and Garry's, and I had eaten there once with them years ago. They had lots of old photos on display on the walls and it was interesting to see that the building had been built in 1928 and run as a grocery store by a Rodgers family. It later became a bakery, and has been run as "Keith's" since 1952. </p>
<p>We each had a large Caesar salad, and then felt justified in having a slice of fresh peach pie. UF had eaten the most marvellous strawberry pie ever there earlier in the summer, but of course 'tis not the season. The pie was delicious, not overly sweetened, with thin flaky pastry. </p>
<p>We stopped by Ian's on the way home, hoping for a cup of tea there, but there was no answer, so we continued on home. I had called and left a message for Amelia earlier in the day, hoping to catch them at home, but alas... no Amelia. Marie phoned and suggested we spend some time together tomorrow evening, and I will get together with Gerry after Sunday. </p>
<p>Back to our photo sorting, with an exciting discovery... a set of photographs from England of a cousin of Mom's and Auntie Rita's and her family... a scoundrel husband who deserted her when their three boys were very young. He went to Canada and hadn't been heard of in thirty years when the eldest son finally found him, after much searching. UF and I spent a long time trying to figure out who all the folks were in the photos, and have come up with a theory, which if true is very exciting indeed... that the elderly woman in one of the photos may be our Nana Lee's sister, the only photo we would have of her! We are going to try to print it up tomorrow... UF did a great job of enlarging it on the computer, and then sending it off to Geoff. His mother may recognize the woman as being her dad's sister... fingers crossed.</p>
<p>Susan called me at 9 p.m. and I got to speak with Amelia, even though she was very busy trying to get her mom involved in an activity with her. Susan said she has been very bossy today. I can't imagine! They had a busy day at swimming lessons and the zoo, and Amelia agreed that she had seen lots of animals and was going to see Riku tomorrow at the museum. It was just lovely to hear her voice, and I could hear her laughing in the background. I miss her a lot and it was sweet indeed to hear her say "I love you, Nana" twice! </p>
<p>I called Riku at 7:30 and he was busy eating his dinner. We chatted for a bit, and sang "two little dickie birds" together. He is now remembering the second part of it, and not going directly to the birds "fly away all!" I will call tomorrow and hear all about his excursion with Doug, Susan, and Amelia. </p>
<p>We finished off the dregs of the port and discussed whether we should try a new brand tomorrow or stick with this one, which we both like a lot. We did decide to only drink port made in Portugal though, after reading an online article which Candy referred us to. UF wondered casually what time the liquor store opens in the morning. </p>
<p>He is downstairs drinking his Sleepytime tea, and he has had his drops, so any minute now he should be coming up the stairs ready to fall instantly asleep! </p>
<p>Off I go to bed... much too late, considering at midnight both of us agreed it was bedtime. My guess is that UF is downstairs looking through photos... I won't check to see, as I would end up joining him. Night night... </p>
<p>p.s. forgot to mention that we continue on with our drying up of the recreation room, emptying the dehumidifier, walking around in my bare feet to point out the areas to UF that are still damp, and moving furniture to help the process... coming along well.</p>
