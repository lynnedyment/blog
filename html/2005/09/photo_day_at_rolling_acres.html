								<h2>Photo Day at Rolling Acres</h2>
								<p>I woke to a perfect fall-is-coming Ontario day today; the air just feels different this morning than that of a summer day. After we both showered and dressed, UF and I enjoyed our leisurely breakfast of cereal with blueberries, toast, and green tea for UF. </p>
<p>We got right back to work on our photo project and spent a couple of hours at the table working our way through the big Rubbermaid box of pics. Auntie Rita had done so much pre-sorting and had them in plastic bags, but of course there are lots of stories contained in those bags, and lots of memories, so it takes longer to go through them than just the mere sorting. It's relaxing and very enjoyable for both of us. </p>
<p>The rec' room floor is almost dry, although the fan and dehumidifier continue to run. UF has done such a great job clearing out the huge number of tapes and commercial videos and the next project is to get labels made up for them so that UF can read them easily. Even he is having trouble reading his handwriting! </p>
<p>We worked away until 2 p.m. before stopping for lunch. I finished up my mu shu vegetables and the last inari Akane had made for me, and UF had a cheese and tomato sandwich; he had some leftover orange beef to eat, but decided he likes the sandwich too much to pass it up. We had a bowl of red grapes each and sat enjoying our tea before getting back to work. </p>
<p>John, Stephanie's boyfriend, was over a few days ago painting outside window sills. The kitchen windows were stuck with paint, so John took care of that before continuing on with cleaning the floor of the garage. UF's old car was leaking oil, so John cleared everything out (UF had also done an amazing job in there over the spring and got rid of so much), power-washed the floor and some of the walls too, and put everything back in place. UF is very pleased with this job, now done and off his mental list. </p>
<p>We had a laugh about John's height; UF has asked him if he would get the ladder and change the lightbulbs in the back hallway. John asked "this one?" and reached up and unscrewed the plate! UF was just astounded at how handy it is to be tall. He forgot to ask him to check out the overhead light in his own room but Paul came by to pick up some baskets and photos for Beth, and also just reached up and changed the two bulbs in that room. UF thinks every house should come equipped with one tall person. Me too. </p>
<p>By' came by to take away an old dehumidifier; he was on his way to the dump and he and UF went down to the headbump space to see if there was more that could go. A few more things out of the house... By' also is taking all the empty Rubbermaid containers so the room will really look empty soon. </p>
<p>UF scanned some photos into the computer while I worked away at sorting more of them into their designated slots in the photo boxes. It's amazing how many stacks of pics spread out on the table can so easily be contained in just two boxes. The one box of By's and his family's photos is a bigger one and UF is looking forward to having them all sorted and walking in with "just a few photos" for them when he goes for dinner one night. There are hundreds of them already, good ones, bad ones, and lots of duplicates. We sat, going through each and every photo, with UF deciding which were keepers and which were not. It was hard for him to see how many of the Legion members, friends of theirs for years and years, have now passed on. The afternoon flew by. </p>
<p>UF was going for dinner with By' and family tonight, while I spent my evening with Marie and Graham. Graham picked me up at 5:15; UF left shortly after that. I had a very relaxing visit with Marie, sitting outside on her double rocking swing for an hour before heading back in when the air got cool. I hadn't eaten dinner, after my big and late lunch, so Marie toasted three pieces of whole wheat Italian bread for me, to enjoy along with my tea. Perfect! I looked at all of her latest photo pages which are lovely as always. Except for a couple of dozen photos Marie is all caught up on all of her albums! One day... </p>
<p>I arrived home at 10 p.m. to find UF busy on the computer. We ran out of port last night, so UF suggested we sit in the living room for our evening nightcap, he opened up a bottle of ice wine, and poured us <strong>big</strong> glasses of it! Ah, we will sleep tonight! He insisted we finish off the couple of inches left in the bottom, and we headed off to bed after chatting for a while. We have our drive to Glenn's and Wendy's tomorrow and hope to be on the road around 10 a.m., without setting an alarm. </p>
<p>I phoned Riku, caught him in the tub, and called back in fifteen minutes. He told me a little bit about his trip to the museum with Amelia and Susan, but mostly by saying yes to all the things I asked if he did. We sang three or four songs together though, before I hung up... favourites right now are "Two Little Dicky Birds", "She Sailed Away... ", "Little Miss Muffett", and "Humpty Dumpty"... not songs of course but nursery rhymes, which he enjoys as much as Brynnie did at this age. Riku has a very good memory and loves to sing and participate. </p>
<p>Back to the photos; we had a very interesting discovery tonight, and thanks to UF's thoughts on it, we may have discovered the only photo we have of Nana Lee's sister Florence. AR had an envelope with nothing but photos of one family, including individual shots of one of three boys in the other photos. There was no writing for clues on the back of any of them but UF recognized, after careful scrutiny, the face of Don O'Hanlan, a second cousin of Mom's and AR's. He had lived here with AR and UF for a while but turned out to be a relative they were happy to have out of their lives; his dad had deserted his family--the three little boys--years and years before. However, in one of the photos there is a photo of his wife and an elderly woman, whom UF believes is Nana's sister. He is hoping to get a clear enough copy of it from his printer that perhaps Kay in England might recognize the woman; it would be her Dad's sister. Must get that done and sent off though quickly, as Kay just celebrated her 90th birthday. She would be our last hope of knowing for certain if the woman is or is not our great-aunt. </p>
<p>I plan to be in bed reading in just a few minutes... and it's 11 p.m.</p>
