								<h2>Take Me Out to the Ball Game!</h2>
								<p>Monday, Monday. I dashed into the shower quickly, Kelly followed, and we walked the children to school. Hot, hot, hot! Kelly decided we needed the air conditioner on since it was so humid, and this made it possible for me to clean the window in the upstairs bathroom. We've been meaning to do this for some time, and while Kelly went off for passports, expecting a long lineup, I got busy cleaning. This window was a cinch to clean, as both windows slide down and then open towards me, making it very easy to clean both sides. The screen had a good soaking in the tub, after which the tub needed a thorough cleaning too. I wiped down the walls, the cabinets and decided to leave the floor for tomorrow. It was hot! </p>
<p>Kelly called to say she was on her way home, finishing up hours sooner than she expected! Caillie called just minutes later to say Myk' and Miya had forgotten about her, so off I dashed to intercept them. They headed back to school, Kelly met up with me, and off she went to collect them all. Ah, the joys of four schedules! </p>
<p>We had lunch outside, competing with the wasps, which wasn't much fun at all. It was a hot sweaty walk back to school at 12:30 and a delight to come back into the AC'd house. Kelly brought the ironing board up for me, as it was cool enough to iron, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching TV while ironing. Makes the time go by so much faster! </p>
<p>After the normal after-school routine -- snacks, piano practice for Bryn and Caillie, and lessons for Myk' and Bry' -- and a quick grilled cheese dinner for Bryn and Caillie, Uncle Mark joined us for the subway ride to the Dome. He had treated us all to the tickets, and we picked up Caillie's friend Ursula on our way. </p>
<p>We had great seats, and Bry', Myk' and Gregg joined us a half hour later, just as the game started. It was a beautiful night, and thank goodness a little cooler as the night wore on. The Dome was open to the clear night air, and the Toronto Blue Jays were playing the Boston Red Socks. Bryn patiently explained the game to me, Caillie and Ursula were totally involved in their own little worlds of purses, treats provided by Ursula, many trips to the bathroom, and the concession stands. Myk' is an avid fan, and watches the game as closely as the adults did. Gregg treated us to peanuts, and we actually all stood and stretched at one point and sang "Take Me Out to the Ball Game", with vigour, and enjoyed the evening so much. </p>
<p>It was running late with the game tied at 5 all when we decided to leave; it was 10:20 at that point and Ursula had to be home at 11 p.m. Gregg dropped his children at home, Kelly took Bryn and Caillie to Hans', while Mark and I took the subway home. We had been tempted to stay and see how it ended but were glad we left with everyone else. </p>
<p>We were all very tired; the heat certainly saps me of energy and it had been a busy day. All of us were in bed within a half hour of getting home. I thoroughly enjoyed the outing; a ball game is a rare event for me, and this was my second baseball game at the Dome, both compliments of Mark.</p>
