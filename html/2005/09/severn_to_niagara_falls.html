								<h2>Severn to Niagara Falls</h2>
								<p>I awoke at 9 a.m. today, after a wonderful sleep. One of the big windows off the deck was open all evening; I was nice and cozy, and the fresh air yesterday was just what I needed. Wendy was up bustling about, making tea for UF and me, and rousing Glenn, who had to be at the board meeting at 10 a.m. I took a very quick shower, dressed, and took my tea outside to a sunny spot to sit with UF. We watched a few canoes on the waterway and I read a little bit, but mostly we just sat and relaxed, enjoying our unbusy morning. </p>
<p>Wendy called us in for breakfast, which we ate at the regular dining table at the front of the trailer. UF thoroughly enjoyed his most delicious omelette, and told Wendy several times how much he liked it... filled with bacon, mushrooms, and green pepper. I had a fried egg, perfectly cooked, and then three pieces of toasted flax seed bread. Steph', John, and eventually Wendy, joined us at the table as well and we sat chatting for an hour or so. </p>
<p>After the dishes were done up, Wendy and I went for a walk around the whole park. The names of the little lanes are sweet... Blue Heron Walk, Chickadee Place, Squirrel Lane, etc. There are so many beautiful trailers, looking more like homes, with exquisite landscaping, lush green grass, rockeries, but with the wonderful view of the water right there as well. There is a large outdoor swimming pool, a big community hall where the meeting was taking place, a beach area, a playground, horseshoe pits, and even a tool workshop for repairs or hobby work. It's a well run and really lovely spot, and I think Glenn was lucky to buy the double lot. There are sixty new lots going in this year, all about a third the size of Glenn's. </p>
<p>Later on I walked over to the community centre to see how the meeting was going, hoping to meet up with Glenn on his way home. No such luck; it ended up running for over three hours and Glenn was really hungry when he got home. Wendy made him an omelette and Glenn took his tea out to sit with UF, who had been reading the Blue Heron newsletter put out each month at the park. </p>
<p>Steph', Wendy, John and I played a game of cards; I taught them to play Spades, which they all enjoyed, and Steph' came out way in the lead. As soon as we finished, Glenn, Wendy, UF and I went out for a cruise on the river and canals. UF sat in the boat on shore and then it was put in the water, where Wendy and I joined him and Glenn. The sun had come out in full force just as Glenn arrived home; he was afraid he wasn't going to have any time with us at all, so this was perfect. We spent an hour and a half exploring various channels and ending up at Little Big Chute (I think!) with UF and I getting a little wet in the process. There are lots of big boats on the lake, leaving us in their wake, but the water was warm, and Glenn was quick to slow us down when he could see it coming. </p>
<p>We saw tiny little cottages and trailers, massive big brick city-looking homes, and a couple of big and expensive lodges too. Many of them are year-round homes, and it was quieter and more serene once we got back in our little waterway with a speed limit of about 15 mph. </p>
<p>Originally, UF and I had planned to leave about 4 p.m. so that we would be home before it got too late or dark, but Glenn had told us about a local place with the best fish and chips they have ever had. Well, somehow that was very appealing, as was the name of it... <br />
"The Principal's Schoolhouse". It is only open four nights a week and tonight was one of them, so we packed up quickly, and arrived very hungry at 5:10 p.m. It was every bit as good as they had told us it would be... firm white halibut, fresh cut homemade fries, and homemade creamy cole slaw. It is family run, with two young teens as waiters, the grandmother perhaps at the register, and Grandpa doing the cooking... all very very friendly. The fish was so good I asked for an extra piece and was glad I had.. yum! The building was built in 1913 and was a one-room school house for grades one through four in 1965. Uncle Frank and I had agreed to treat for dinner, and I arranged with the woman at the register when I first went in to not allow my brother to pick up the bill. She held firm and would not take his money when we were ready to leave. </p>
<p>Glenn led the way to a wild blueberry stand, where we picked up berries and peaches, before heading right out to the highway beside the stand. We said our goodbyes at 6:15, promising to call when we landed at home. </p>
<p>The ride home was terrific; we had light traffic all the way, except for a little flurry around Barrie, we listened to Isaac again, chatted about the scenery and the "long horned Asian Beetle" warning signs, and didn't take any wrong turns in this direction. Traffic coming toward us was just unbelievably heavy though, and we assumed these were the folks trying to avoid the big crowds tomorrow. </p>
<p>We pulled into our driveway at 8:40, so had made very good time indeed. I unloaded the car before calling Glenn, unpacked my bag, and checked my email, finding lots of photos from Susan. UF sat on the sofa behind me and we had such fun looking at all the various Amelia poses... scowling at a crab at Pacifica with her dad, frollicking at their cottage in Ontario, and visiting with all her relatives there, and just admiring that wee face and all of her expressions. We laughed out loud several times at some of them... taking charge, determined not to do whatever was expected, pushing her stroller on her own, and interacting with all the children she had time with. Lovely way to relax at this end of our day. </p>
<p>UF was quite tired and ready to call it a night at 10 p.m. but somehow we ended up going to bed at 11:30. I made us up a bowl of muskmelon and blueberries and of course we had our glass of port as well. </p>
<p>A little earlier, while UF tried to clean up some files on his computer, I called Riku. Once again, I caught him in the tub, perhaps with Bryn, as he told me he was washing his daddy's hair and being very careful. He said he had a <strong>big belly</strong> as he had eaten noodles, and pototoes, and rice! and broccoli and carrots... he is obviously not a believer in the low-carb diet! We sang "Two Little Dicky Birds" tonight before saying "goodnight sweetheart", "I love you" and "talk to you soon"... repeating all of it back to me as I say it to him. </p>
<p>In bed at midnight with my book... "Five People You Meet in Heaven", a book UF ordered from Amazon, and which I am enjoying very much. I am quite sure it is on my book list at home...</p>
