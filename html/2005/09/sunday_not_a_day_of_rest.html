								<h2>Sunday, Not a Day of Rest!</h2>
								<p>Today was a great day, as I accomplished a job that was one of three big ones on my "list". But first, our morning. There were no children here today, and it was a lazy morning for me. I arose at 9 a.m. after reading in bed for a bit, my very favourite way to start off any day. Kelly went off for her first run in a while, a three miler, having had a rotten bug during the summer that kept her off her running schedule for too long. Gregg left at the same time with Manitou for their usual Sunday morning in the park routine, after stopping at Starbuck's for a coffee (for Gregg). They met up at 11:30 at the park and walked home together. I was lazing about, although did throw in a load of laundry before getting to some emails. </p>
<p>Gregg got right to work in the kitchen, making what has become their standard Sunday brunch dish when they are on their own... a most delicious stuffed croissant, with "ham" and Swiss cheese for me, and real ham and cheese for them. He dips into a seasoned French toast mixture, and then fries it slowly on the stovetop, until it has melted and is puffed up. It is <strong>so</strong> good! I had a cup of tea to finish off, and then we all went to work. </p>
<p>Gregg has been wanting to reorganize the shelves in the basement to make them more easily accessible; they had pulled much of the storage things out of the room looking for something the day before so that gave him the incentive to just get to it. He worked really hard all afternoon, figuring out how to make the shelves stable, despite not having found studs in the walls. Just before dinner we went down to admire this well-done job; he was determined to get it done before leaving for Ottawa tomorrow and he did it. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kelly and I were both working on the second floor, on different projects. Kelly had pulled everything out of the storage closet in the master bedroom to access the winter clothing articles for the party yesterday, and the room was filled with the contents of the closet. This was her opportunity to go through bags of clothes, and fill two bags with donations for the Katrina drive next Sunday. I took some of Caillie's clothing for Amelia one day, Kelly tossed and eliminated and finally — after a couple of hours — had it all done and was able to sit and do some CM work in a very tidy and organized room. </p>
<p>The children came by for their bikes and of course it was lovely to see them when I wasn't expecting to. Uncle Mark came by as well, and Kelly gave him some tomato salad for his lunch tomorrow. He was going with Caillie to the toy store to buy something with her birthday gift certificate from him. I suggested to Bryn, since he was going to be on his own for a bit, that he stay and help me with his room, but he realized quite suddenly, it seemed to me, that he did have other plans already.  :)</p>
<p>It was hot enough that I didn't want to work on the third floor, on the girls rooms, so decided to do Bryn and Bry's second floor room instead. I started by washing the window, which really needed the attention. It wasn't done last year as I didn't think I could get it down past the huge wardrobe in their room, but Kelly realized if we took the knobs off it might work. It did, and it looked great when I finished. These windows are marvellous as they slide inwards making it very easy to access both sides. All windows should be this easy! And from there I went on to removing every single item from the shelving unit, dusting and washing the shelves, turning the mattresses, pulling out the bed and washing the baseboards and the floor, and ending by pulling off the bedding. It looks terrific too and I was very pleased with it. </p>
<p>By this time we were all hungry; Kelly had suggested that Gregg do her favourite stuffed chicken breasts, Kelly made a wonderful fresh-from-the-garden tomato salad, with their basil and mint from down the alleyway, topped with feta cheese. Meanwhile, I made up a mushroom, red onion, lots of spinach, and garlic mixture and cooked it up with some spicy "beef" I had bought. </p>
<p>At 8 p.m. we all sat down in front of the TV, watching a bit of the Emmy awards while we ate; it was so good. Oh, the chicken was stuffed with goat cheese and spinach and then barbecued. However, Kelly and I both felt we needed just a little extra something and drove out for a loaf of Italian bread to soak up the juices from our second helping of the tomato salad. I <strong>love</strong> being in Ontario in September, especially when there are tomatoes growing right outside the back door! </p>
<p>I did a couple of additional loads of laundry, and mended two more of Caillie's summer tops while we relaxed and watched about half of the first "Oceans 11".</p>
<p>I called Riku at 10:15 p.m. (my time... 7:15 for him) and caught him in the tub; Bryn was there with him, but I talked with Riku about his carousel ride in Golden Gate park with Amelia today and we sang the alphabet song together. He sings it so very well! and of course does the "lmnop" line as one word, as is typical for this run. I also sang the Baby Beluga song to him before saying "goodnight sweetheart" and hearing it back from Riku. </p>
<p>We all headed upstairs at 10:30, feeling mighty pleased with ourselves. Gregg leaves for Ottawa in the morning and I read until midnight.</p>
