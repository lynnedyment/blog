								<h2>Caillie is Eight!</h2>
								<p>Happy birthday to Caillie, eight years old today. She called this morning and we all sang "happy birthday" to her; she says she feels exactly the same as she did yesterday. </p>
<p>It was such a busy day today, from the time we woke up until we collapsed on the sofa at 7:15 p.m. </p>
<p>My first duty was to make white cupcakes with pink icing. I made one batch, as we didn't have enough eggs in for two, and because I didn't use Pam, they stuck terribly to the cupcake pans. What a disaster! I managed to salvage two out of a dozen. Gregg went to the corner store for more eggs, so I got those made up and in the oven before leaving at 9:40 for Bryn's first soccer game of the day. I had to turn the oven off and leave them and must admit I thought they too would be a disaster; they were already in the pan before Kelly told me about the Pam. </p>
<p>It was perfect weather for the game, not too hot and not too cool. Bryn's team lost the first game and with two to go we worried they might lose heart for the remaining games. The children went home with their Dad, Kelly and Gregg went to buy loot bag goodies and snacks, and I made the pink icing. Thank goodness the second batch was just fine; they had pulled away from the pan and tipped out perfectly for me. Whew! I had to use two of the others but once covered with icing you could not tell how mangled they were! </p>
<p>I made grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch for Kelly and Gregg, and I wolfed down a bowl of the leftover pesto pasta from the other night; we were all really hungry as we hadn't had time for breakfast this morning. Rush, rush, rush! </p>
<p>This second game was not quite so comfortable as the sun was beating down on us; their was cloud cover though and we were grateful for it when it appeared. It is a pleasure sitting on the grass watching these young boys, who have become very proficient over the years (this is Bryn's eight season!), but alas they lost to a better team this afternoon. Kelly and Gregg said they have been much better at passing in past games so they seem a bit off the game today. Bryn hurt his arm and sat out the last of this game. </p>
<p>The game started late, Kelly was worrying about not having things organized for the eleven extra children arriving at 3:30. We left the game just a little hour ahead of their arrival! However, everything went very smoothly. Gregg got busy organizing the various activities for the "Survivor" theme Caillie had decided on a couple of days ago, I got the "treats" out, Bryn and I blew up yellow balloons and hung them from the table outside, Bryn put the loot bags together, Caillie decorated her cupcakes, and Kelly dashed about taking care of all the other details... hauling out winter coats, boots, scarves, mittens, and overpants. </p>
<p>What a great and successful party this was. The girls played in the back yard for a half hour and then the "Survivor" games got underway. Twelve children drew slips of paper which put them on either the blue team or the yellow team. The first event was hilarious; there were two sets of the above winter clothing and each contestant, one from each team, had to dress as quickly as possible, tying the scard once, run up the back lane to Bryn, give him a "high five", dash back, undress, and then stand on a wastepaper basket until one of them fell off. I took lots of photos of this event, since everyone was laughing so hard which made it even harder to run in those awkward clothes. </p>
<p>The next "event" was a "mystery food" puzzle. Gregg had set up two sets of five bowls filled with interesting textures; one set was in the living room and one in the dining room. One member of each team was blindfolded and then led to the bowls. In the bowls were three "fingers" of cold watermelon, cold creamed corn, a bowl of sticky cooked and cooled oatmeal, dog kibble, and a hard boiled egg, shelled. The oatmeal and the creamed corn got the most "oooh, this is disgusting!" Most of the children guessed the egg, and most did not guess more than two correctly. It was great fun to see them look at them all once their masks were removed. </p>
<p>Following this was a "how well do you know the party girl?" quiz. Kelly had a long list of questions made up, the teams sat in the yard opposite each other, with their own paper and a marker. "What time does Caillie go to bed?" was one of the questions, with three choices. The correct answer was 7:30 p.m. and one team guessed correctly. "How many pets does Caillie have", "where was Caillie born?", "how many plane flights has she been on?"... sixteen!, and "what is her favourite colour?"... purple now, used to be yellow. </p>
<p>While this was going on, Gregg was again busy in the kitchen, making up six plates of covered food. The teams lined up at the dining table, each chose a number which corresponded to a number on the cover of the food, and then proceeded to eat, as quickly as possible, the food on the plate using only their tongues! The guests were allowed to pass it on to another team mate if they chose to, and a couple did just that. It was all junior baby food... carrots, banana puree, applesauce, sweet potato, chocolate pudding, and I believe butterscotch pudding but of course they didn't know what they were for certain until they tasted it. They all loved this, especially the more adventurous of the groups. </p>
<p>Caillie announced at the end of this event that this had been her very favourite party ever! Quite the compliment, and the adults enjoyed it every bit as much as she did. </p>
<p>Bryn left reluctantly at 4:35 to play his last game. Uncle Mark and Hans went with him, but I know Bryn would have been happy to forget about it, especially as his arm was a bit sore and he was hot and tired. However, he played the last game of the season, and once again his team lost. It was such a disappointment but Bryn takes it in good stride. </p>
<p>Caillie sat on the steps as she opened her gifts, with the child giving the gift sitting beside her. This worked very nicely as they all had a good view of the gifts, and then the attention was on their gift as well. Caillie handed out the treat bags, very cute little cloth purses filled with goodies. </p>
<p>I was ready for a little quiet time and locked myself upstairs until all the children but ours had left. They went with Mark over to Hans' immediately since they had dinner reservations at a Japanese restaurant on the Danforth. Bryn was looking forward to an egg dish he has recently discovered, and said he would have a tofu dish as well. </p>
<p>Gregg, Kelly, and I got busy cleaning up both inside and outside. We made quick work of it although there was lots to do. Finally we all collapsed on the sofa, watching tv, and feeling too tired to move. It had been a very busy day from the time we got up until then. Thank goodness for Gregg who somehow summoned up enough energy to start cooking dinner. We didn't even ask what he was making, as we thought he planned to surprise us, but it smelled so good... tomatoes and ???</p>
<p>A half hour later a most delicious canneloni dish was ready for us, with fresh parmesan to top it off. We sat in the living room enjoying every single bite of it, and Kelly and I shared the last piece of it. </p>
<p>I called and spoke with Riku who answered the phone; he was watching "Toy Story", his daddy was not with him, and he asked me to sing him "the whale song" and I sang the alligator song too. He sounded tired and coughed a couple of times; it was 7:15 in SF, which meant 10:15 here. We all headed up to bed at 11 p.m., and I turned out my light at 11:35, after reading another couple of chapters in my Annie Proulx book. It's a collection of cowboy stories, set in Wyoming, I believe, and very well written; I am trying hard to have it read in time to give to Ian when I am in the Falls next.</p>
