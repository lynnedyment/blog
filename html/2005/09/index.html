								<h2><a href="/2005/09/a_much_earlier_start_to_our_da.html">A Much Earlier Start to our Day!</a></h2>
								<p>This morning Uncle Frank and I were both awake at 6:30 a.m., and then drifted off until 8:30. Breakfast was over at just past 10 a.m., a great improvement over yesterday. We sat chatting over our cereal, with blueberries and flax seed, toast, and tea, until almost noon and then got to work.</p>
<p>The "headbump" was our first mission of the day, clearing out a few more items from the storage area downstairs. We accomplished quite a lot before our backs demanded to be allowed to remain upright, and added lots to our pile that was quickly collecting in the kitchen and front hall way. The last two storage boxes contained photographs, hundreds of them, many of which Auntie Rita had carefully sorted into various categories. We made many piles on the kitchen table, for Gail and Tom, Candy and Rick, my family, the Legion, By's family, Neal, etc. We worked steadily at this for two plus hours before Uncle Frank's eyes grew weary. We did stop from time to time for an interesting story to be told though. I was in my element, as not only were we working with photos, but we were tossing lots of them out too; blurry photos, duplicates, unknown faces, etc. did not make the cut. Flylady would have been very proud of us today! </p>
<p>Glenn called in the morning, inviting us to go to his trailer north of Barrie, about a three hour drive from here. I wasn't sure UF would be game for this but with no hesitation at all said sure! I haven't been there and am looking forward to the time with Glenn, Wendy, Steph', and her boyfriend John. John was here at one time painting a couple of windows for UF and unsticking the kitchen window he painted last week. </p>
<p>We decided we needed a break, so tidied up a bit and went off to a local grocery store for their sale on soup and grapes, and picked up a couple of melons as well. It was just a gorgeous day today, sunny and not quite so hot again, but crystal clear and wonderful. UF suggested a ride to Fonthill via the back roads, and what a treat this was. I drove down roads I have never travelled before, admiring the beautiful old Ontario brick and frame homes, the huge 16-acre lots, the tidy farms, and the narrow treed lanes. We stopped for a basket of peaches (UF has been very disappointed in the peaches this year), and hope they will ripen nicely for us. He hasn't had a "standing over the sink to eat" peach yet this summer. </p>
<p>On the way home we stopped at "Keith's" for a light dinner. This is the spot where Doug's parents often stopped for lunch and "sky high pie" on their way to Sandy and Garry's, and I had eaten there once with them years ago. They had lots of old photos on display on the walls and it was interesting to see that the building had been built in 1928 and run as a grocery store by a Rodgers family. It later became a bakery, and has been run as "Keith's" since 1952. </p>
<p>We each had a large Caesar salad, and then felt justified in having a slice of fresh peach pie. UF had eaten the most marvellous strawberry pie ever there earlier in the summer, but of course 'tis not the season. The pie was delicious, not overly sweetened, with thin flaky pastry. </p>
<p>We stopped by Ian's on the way home, hoping for a cup of tea there, but there was no answer, so we continued on home. I had called and left a message for Amelia earlier in the day, hoping to catch them at home, but alas... no Amelia. Marie phoned and suggested we spend some time together tomorrow evening, and I will get together with Gerry after Sunday. </p>
<p>Back to our photo sorting, with an exciting discovery... a set of photographs from England of a cousin of Mom's and Auntie Rita's and her family... a scoundrel husband who deserted her when their three boys were very young. He went to Canada and hadn't been heard of in thirty years when the eldest son finally found him, after much searching. UF and I spent a long time trying to figure out who all the folks were in the photos, and have come up with a theory, which if true is very exciting indeed... that the elderly woman in one of the photos may be our Nana Lee's sister, the only photo we would have of her! We are going to try to print it up tomorrow... UF did a great job of enlarging it on the computer, and then sending it off to Geoff. His mother may recognize the woman as being her dad's sister... fingers crossed.</p>
<p>Susan called me at 9 p.m. and I got to speak with Amelia, even though she was very busy trying to get her mom involved in an activity with her. Susan said she has been very bossy today. I can't imagine! They had a busy day at swimming lessons and the zoo, and Amelia agreed that she had seen lots of animals and was going to see Riku tomorrow at the museum. It was just lovely to hear her voice, and I could hear her laughing in the background. I miss her a lot and it was sweet indeed to hear her say "I love you, Nana" twice! </p>
<p>I called Riku at 7:30 and he was busy eating his dinner. We chatted for a bit, and sang "two little dickie birds" together. He is now remembering the second part of it, and not going directly to the birds "fly away all!" I will call tomorrow and hear all about his excursion with Doug, Susan, and Amelia. </p>
<p>We finished off the dregs of the port and discussed whether we should try a new brand tomorrow or stick with this one, which we both like a lot. We did decide to only drink port made in Portugal though, after reading an online article which Candy referred us to. UF wondered casually what time the liquor store opens in the morning. </p>
<p>He is downstairs drinking his Sleepytime tea, and he has had his drops, so any minute now he should be coming up the stairs ready to fall instantly asleep! </p>
<p>Off I go to bed... much too late, considering at midnight both of us agreed it was bedtime. My guess is that UF is downstairs looking through photos... I won't check to see, as I would end up joining him. Night night... </p>
<p>p.s. forgot to mention that we continue on with our drying up of the recreation room, emptying the dehumidifier, walking around in my bare feet to point out the areas to UF that are still damp, and moving furniture to help the process... coming along well.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/photo_day_at_rolling_acres.html">Photo Day at Rolling Acres</a></h2>
								<p>I woke to a perfect fall-is-coming Ontario day today; the air just feels different this morning than that of a summer day. After we both showered and dressed, UF and I enjoyed our leisurely breakfast of cereal with blueberries, toast, and green tea for UF. </p>
<p>We got right back to work on our photo project and spent a couple of hours at the table working our way through the big Rubbermaid box of pics. Auntie Rita had done so much pre-sorting and had them in plastic bags, but of course there are lots of stories contained in those bags, and lots of memories, so it takes longer to go through them than just the mere sorting. It's relaxing and very enjoyable for both of us. </p>
<p>The rec' room floor is almost dry, although the fan and dehumidifier continue to run. UF has done such a great job clearing out the huge number of tapes and commercial videos and the next project is to get labels made up for them so that UF can read them easily. Even he is having trouble reading his handwriting! </p>
<p>We worked away until 2 p.m. before stopping for lunch. I finished up my mu shu vegetables and the last inari Akane had made for me, and UF had a cheese and tomato sandwich; he had some leftover orange beef to eat, but decided he likes the sandwich too much to pass it up. We had a bowl of red grapes each and sat enjoying our tea before getting back to work. </p>
<p>John, Stephanie's boyfriend, was over a few days ago painting outside window sills. The kitchen windows were stuck with paint, so John took care of that before continuing on with cleaning the floor of the garage. UF's old car was leaking oil, so John cleared everything out (UF had also done an amazing job in there over the spring and got rid of so much), power-washed the floor and some of the walls too, and put everything back in place. UF is very pleased with this job, now done and off his mental list. </p>
<p>We had a laugh about John's height; UF has asked him if he would get the ladder and change the lightbulbs in the back hallway. John asked "this one?" and reached up and unscrewed the plate! UF was just astounded at how handy it is to be tall. He forgot to ask him to check out the overhead light in his own room but Paul came by to pick up some baskets and photos for Beth, and also just reached up and changed the two bulbs in that room. UF thinks every house should come equipped with one tall person. Me too. </p>
<p>By' came by to take away an old dehumidifier; he was on his way to the dump and he and UF went down to the headbump space to see if there was more that could go. A few more things out of the house... By' also is taking all the empty Rubbermaid containers so the room will really look empty soon. </p>
<p>UF scanned some photos into the computer while I worked away at sorting more of them into their designated slots in the photo boxes. It's amazing how many stacks of pics spread out on the table can so easily be contained in just two boxes. The one box of By's and his family's photos is a bigger one and UF is looking forward to having them all sorted and walking in with "just a few photos" for them when he goes for dinner one night. There are hundreds of them already, good ones, bad ones, and lots of duplicates. We sat, going through each and every photo, with UF deciding which were keepers and which were not. It was hard for him to see how many of the Legion members, friends of theirs for years and years, have now passed on. The afternoon flew by. </p>
<p>UF was going for dinner with By' and family tonight, while I spent my evening with Marie and Graham. Graham picked me up at 5:15; UF left shortly after that. I had a very relaxing visit with Marie, sitting outside on her double rocking swing for an hour before heading back in when the air got cool. I hadn't eaten dinner, after my big and late lunch, so Marie toasted three pieces of whole wheat Italian bread for me, to enjoy along with my tea. Perfect! I looked at all of her latest photo pages which are lovely as always. Except for a couple of dozen photos Marie is all caught up on all of her albums! One day... </p>
<p>I arrived home at 10 p.m. to find UF busy on the computer. We ran out of port last night, so UF suggested we sit in the living room for our evening nightcap, he opened up a bottle of ice wine, and poured us <strong>big</strong> glasses of it! Ah, we will sleep tonight! He insisted we finish off the couple of inches left in the bottom, and we headed off to bed after chatting for a while. We have our drive to Glenn's and Wendy's tomorrow and hope to be on the road around 10 a.m., without setting an alarm. </p>
<p>I phoned Riku, caught him in the tub, and called back in fifteen minutes. He told me a little bit about his trip to the museum with Amelia and Susan, but mostly by saying yes to all the things I asked if he did. We sang three or four songs together though, before I hung up... favourites right now are "Two Little Dicky Birds", "She Sailed Away... ", "Little Miss Muffett", and "Humpty Dumpty"... not songs of course but nursery rhymes, which he enjoys as much as Brynnie did at this age. Riku has a very good memory and loves to sing and participate. </p>
<p>Back to the photos; we had a very interesting discovery tonight, and thanks to UF's thoughts on it, we may have discovered the only photo we have of Nana Lee's sister Florence. AR had an envelope with nothing but photos of one family, including individual shots of one of three boys in the other photos. There was no writing for clues on the back of any of them but UF recognized, after careful scrutiny, the face of Don O'Hanlan, a second cousin of Mom's and AR's. He had lived here with AR and UF for a while but turned out to be a relative they were happy to have out of their lives; his dad had deserted his family--the three little boys--years and years before. However, in one of the photos there is a photo of his wife and an elderly woman, whom UF believes is Nana's sister. He is hoping to get a clear enough copy of it from his printer that perhaps Kay in England might recognize the woman; it would be her Dad's sister. Must get that done and sent off though quickly, as Kay just celebrated her 90th birthday. She would be our last hope of knowing for certain if the woman is or is not our great-aunt. </p>
<p>I plan to be in bed reading in just a few minutes... and it's 11 p.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/niagara_falls_to_the_severn.html">Niagara Falls to the Severn...</a></h2>
								<p>Uncle Frank and I were both awake at 8:30 this morning, showering and dressing immediately in anticipation of our trip up north. We packed up, and checked our list of items to take with us... water, grapes, pillows, the two melons we bought a couple of days ago, cameras, extra clothes, rain jackets, my veggie burgers, etc. </p>
<p>Frank, Glenn's friend, was here cutting UF's lawn and we had a little chat with him about gas, which is what everyone is talking about right now. We heard that gas was up to $1.59 a litre north of Toronto so we're happy we filled up a couple of days ago. UF paid $1.01 last week for his gas. </p>
<p>We had a couple of errands to run... port, the bank, a stop for UF's cane, a couple of photos beside the car, and so left the Falls at 12:15, later than we planned, but in a relaxed and unhurried way for both of us. UF is very happy to have a driver and plans to hire me, for the price of a drink or two! </p>
<p>We couldn't have asked for a more perfect day for this trip. The weather was ideal, the traffic light; we had Isaac Stern playing (a new set UF hadn't listened to yet), and we chatted away about the scenery. We missed our turn to the 407 east; it came up quickly and we took half an hour finding our way back again, after someone gave us the wrong advice. We did top up with gas though; we were not quite halfway empty, and it cost $35. UF chuckled and said he thought he might be able to fill his tank for only $80 or so! </p>
<p>Barrie is a much bigger place than either of us imagined it to be, and UF had decided we should not arrive at the trailer hungry. We stopped at a huge mall and ate at Harvey's, both of us ordering a fully loaded veggie burger, green salad, and coffee for him and tea for me. We couldn't eat our salads, and so Wendy added those to our salad bowl for dinner that evening. </p>
<p>We reached the trailer at 3:45, having made very good time despite our two stops and late departure. Frank had called Glenn to let him know when we left so he wouldn't be worrying about us. What a beautiful spot they have there! Their lot is the biggest in the park, wide with lots of trees and right on the water. UF has his own wee bedroom, with a double bed!, I slept on the comfortable pull-out, both of us with water views. We took a slow walk to a very pretty bridge over the water, just around the corner from their trailer, and I got lots of pics of UF and Glenn standing looking at the views. </p>
<p>We sat outside on lawn chairs, chatting with Stephanie and John. Steph' went off in a rented kayak and we took photos of her, enjoyed cups of tea, eventually getting our light jackets so we could continue sitting outside. It is a gorgeous spot and we just leaned back in our chairs and enjoyed it all. </p>
<p>Wendy and Glenn set up the table in the front sitting room area, so that we had a water view while eating. Glenn barbecued the biggest steaks I have ever seen; Wendy made delicious garlic mashed pototoes, steamed broccoli, tossed a big green salad, and served three other salads as well... pasta, bean, and carrot. Dinner was very filling so we held off on dessert until later on. Wendy and I did the dishes, and we all went outside to enjoy the fire in the firepit... the evening was cool, and the fire felt wonderful. Steph', John, and I toasted marshmallows... it has been years since I ate one, and we laughed at John, who had found a stick long enough that he could roast his while sitting on the deck. </p>
<p>Neighbours joined us a little later on; the conversation was light and lively. The neighbour collects hot wheels and told us about how he got started and how valuable they are if still in their original boxes.. and how appalled he was when the ones he gave two nephews got opened up to play with! New ones... yes, but valuable if left in the boxes. </p>
<p>They are a very nice couple and talked with Glenn about the election taking place tomorrow for the new board for the park. Glenn is running, although seriously hoping not to win a seat. He feels at least this way he can complain about any decision he's not happy with. </p>
<p>Wendy served key lime pie and cookies and cream cake with tea a little later. We watched the stars come out, so beautiful up here, and UF identified the big dipper from his chair. It rained for about two minutes, although I was under the thickest part of the huge oak tree and so didn't get a drop on me. </p>
<p>The fire was burning down and the night air getting cooler, so we went inside to the front living area. This is a <strong>big</strong> trailer! and doesn't feel like one at all. UF and I read the papers I had brought with us, we all watched some of the New Orleans flooding coverage, Wendy and the two "kids" played cards, and the evening ended with a very relaxed crew on board. </p>
<p>At 1:15 a.m. Wendy and I headed for bed, and I was in bed reading before everyone else did the same. I understood the next day that lights were out at 2 a.m...  a long and very relaxing day.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/severn_to_niagara_falls.html">Severn to Niagara Falls</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke at 9 a.m. today, after a wonderful sleep. One of the big windows off the deck was open all evening; I was nice and cozy, and the fresh air yesterday was just what I needed. Wendy was up bustling about, making tea for UF and me, and rousing Glenn, who had to be at the board meeting at 10 a.m. I took a very quick shower, dressed, and took my tea outside to a sunny spot to sit with UF. We watched a few canoes on the waterway and I read a little bit, but mostly we just sat and relaxed, enjoying our unbusy morning. </p>
<p>Wendy called us in for breakfast, which we ate at the regular dining table at the front of the trailer. UF thoroughly enjoyed his most delicious omelette, and told Wendy several times how much he liked it... filled with bacon, mushrooms, and green pepper. I had a fried egg, perfectly cooked, and then three pieces of toasted flax seed bread. Steph', John, and eventually Wendy, joined us at the table as well and we sat chatting for an hour or so. </p>
<p>After the dishes were done up, Wendy and I went for a walk around the whole park. The names of the little lanes are sweet... Blue Heron Walk, Chickadee Place, Squirrel Lane, etc. There are so many beautiful trailers, looking more like homes, with exquisite landscaping, lush green grass, rockeries, but with the wonderful view of the water right there as well. There is a large outdoor swimming pool, a big community hall where the meeting was taking place, a beach area, a playground, horseshoe pits, and even a tool workshop for repairs or hobby work. It's a well run and really lovely spot, and I think Glenn was lucky to buy the double lot. There are sixty new lots going in this year, all about a third the size of Glenn's. </p>
<p>Later on I walked over to the community centre to see how the meeting was going, hoping to meet up with Glenn on his way home. No such luck; it ended up running for over three hours and Glenn was really hungry when he got home. Wendy made him an omelette and Glenn took his tea out to sit with UF, who had been reading the Blue Heron newsletter put out each month at the park. </p>
<p>Steph', Wendy, John and I played a game of cards; I taught them to play Spades, which they all enjoyed, and Steph' came out way in the lead. As soon as we finished, Glenn, Wendy, UF and I went out for a cruise on the river and canals. UF sat in the boat on shore and then it was put in the water, where Wendy and I joined him and Glenn. The sun had come out in full force just as Glenn arrived home; he was afraid he wasn't going to have any time with us at all, so this was perfect. We spent an hour and a half exploring various channels and ending up at Little Big Chute (I think!) with UF and I getting a little wet in the process. There are lots of big boats on the lake, leaving us in their wake, but the water was warm, and Glenn was quick to slow us down when he could see it coming. </p>
<p>We saw tiny little cottages and trailers, massive big brick city-looking homes, and a couple of big and expensive lodges too. Many of them are year-round homes, and it was quieter and more serene once we got back in our little waterway with a speed limit of about 15 mph. </p>
<p>Originally, UF and I had planned to leave about 4 p.m. so that we would be home before it got too late or dark, but Glenn had told us about a local place with the best fish and chips they have ever had. Well, somehow that was very appealing, as was the name of it... <br />
"The Principal's Schoolhouse". It is only open four nights a week and tonight was one of them, so we packed up quickly, and arrived very hungry at 5:10 p.m. It was every bit as good as they had told us it would be... firm white halibut, fresh cut homemade fries, and homemade creamy cole slaw. It is family run, with two young teens as waiters, the grandmother perhaps at the register, and Grandpa doing the cooking... all very very friendly. The fish was so good I asked for an extra piece and was glad I had.. yum! The building was built in 1913 and was a one-room school house for grades one through four in 1965. Uncle Frank and I had agreed to treat for dinner, and I arranged with the woman at the register when I first went in to not allow my brother to pick up the bill. She held firm and would not take his money when we were ready to leave. </p>
<p>Glenn led the way to a wild blueberry stand, where we picked up berries and peaches, before heading right out to the highway beside the stand. We said our goodbyes at 6:15, promising to call when we landed at home. </p>
<p>The ride home was terrific; we had light traffic all the way, except for a little flurry around Barrie, we listened to Isaac again, chatted about the scenery and the "long horned Asian Beetle" warning signs, and didn't take any wrong turns in this direction. Traffic coming toward us was just unbelievably heavy though, and we assumed these were the folks trying to avoid the big crowds tomorrow. </p>
<p>We pulled into our driveway at 8:40, so had made very good time indeed. I unloaded the car before calling Glenn, unpacked my bag, and checked my email, finding lots of photos from Susan. UF sat on the sofa behind me and we had such fun looking at all the various Amelia poses... scowling at a crab at Pacifica with her dad, frollicking at their cottage in Ontario, and visiting with all her relatives there, and just admiring that wee face and all of her expressions. We laughed out loud several times at some of them... taking charge, determined not to do whatever was expected, pushing her stroller on her own, and interacting with all the children she had time with. Lovely way to relax at this end of our day. </p>
<p>UF was quite tired and ready to call it a night at 10 p.m. but somehow we ended up going to bed at 11:30. I made us up a bowl of muskmelon and blueberries and of course we had our glass of port as well. </p>
<p>A little earlier, while UF tried to clean up some files on his computer, I called Riku. Once again, I caught him in the tub, perhaps with Bryn, as he told me he was washing his daddy's hair and being very careful. He said he had a <strong>big belly</strong> as he had eaten noodles, and pototoes, and rice! and broccoli and carrots... he is obviously not a believer in the low-carb diet! We sang "Two Little Dicky Birds" tonight before saying "goodnight sweetheart", "I love you" and "talk to you soon"... repeating all of it back to me as I say it to him. </p>
<p>In bed at midnight with my book... "Five People You Meet in Heaven", a book UF ordered from Amazon, and which I am enjoying very much. I am quite sure it is on my book list at home...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/a_little_bit_of_this_a_little.html">A Little Bit of This, A Little Bit of That...</a></h2>
								<p>Stayed in bed dozing for fifteen minutes before throwing off the cover and putting my feet on the floor at 8 a.m. UF was still sleeping, so I sat and wrote up my blogs and emptied all the junk mail off my server. I didn't hear UF get up and shower so by the time I left this room he was more than ready for our breakfast together. We had the wild blueberries from up north on our cereal, and they were just as delicious as Glenn and Wendy had promised they would be. </p>
<p>We both feel that my time here is getting short, and I'm sorry I didn't get an earlier start with the day. UF had moved the last of the furniture from the rec' room back in place before breakfast (no wonder he was hungry!), and while he finished a few things up in the room, I got busy cleaning the kitchen counters very thoroughly. </p>
<p>UF wants less clutter everywhere and we agreed that the old counter protector, now worn away underneath and not looking very clean or attractive, could go. This made a big change and we discussed getting rid of some of the four piece flour/sugar etc. ceramic set as well. I pulled everything off, gave it all a good scrubbing, and went on to the second counter, cleaning the microwave, and clearing a few items from that counter too. The largest container is now tucked way underneath in a corner, so when we get rid of those it will still be a complete set. UF had a good idea to use the next biggest for his green tea, the second for brown sugar, and the smallest for regular tea. This just makes the kitchen more suited to his needs.</p>
<p>I joined him downstairs while he went through each of his videos; he wants to make up new labels for them all so that he can read them without struggling through various scribbles, mostly his own! This took a while as there were unmarked videos that we had to stop and see a bit of, but we threw a few out and UF made up new labels on the computer last night. We will get at those in the morning and cross yet another job off the list (which is getting longer as we come across more things to do). </p>
<p>Before leaving the rec' room, though, we had a peek in the closet we cleaned out last fall, and decided the tennis rackets, an old receiver, and some weights could go, but came across four photo boxes and a big plastic container filled with... more photos! Up they went to the kitchen to be dealt with in our quiet, sit-down moments. However, the closet now contains only a box of old 8 mm movies, which UF doesn't want to think about yet, an old screen, four badminton rackets, a bag of balls in case he has children visit, and his ab machine. He promised that the next time I came he would have abs of steel, or perhaps platinum! </p>
<p>It was a gorgeous sunny and warm day, so I served lunch outside today. We had UF's favourite tomato sandwiches again, with a cup of mushroom soup, and apple juice. UF had the last dish of jello; I must make him more before I leave. </p>
<p>We decided as long as we were outside we would continue with an outdoor job, so while I pulled rhubarb from three separate beds, UF did some serious weeding of thick vines threatening to take over at the side of the house. It was hot work and he was willing to sit in a lawn chair in the shade and top and bottom the rhubarb for me. </p>
<p>I had taken the burners off the stove and had them in the dishwasher so the rhubard got put into a sinkful of cold water until after dinner. I finished cleaning the stove, helped UF get some things back into the headbump space, and we both sat down with a cup of tea and sorted through photos, and more photos. There are lots of stories that go along with the photos and UF tells me all the interesting bits of the older Legion members... this one flew bombers in WW1; this led a team that was wiped out, all but him, in WW11; and of course there are funny stories as well... the gal whom they could never keep away from the microphone at dances even though she had a wretched voice; after her husband died she was determined to win the heart of another man, married, and was successful... and continued to sing! And of course there are the heartbreaking photos of a very young AR and UF with their two little boys, and oh so many of a very curvaceous AR posing for her favourite photographer, Uncle Frank. He has many of these at the computer waiting to go on file here, and in the screensaver mode. </p>
<p>Gerry called and invited us over for a visit at John and Debbie's, who live just down the road from UF, but we were both feeling pretty grubby and in need of second showers by this point. We should have gone, as we ended up not going out the entire day. </p>
<p>I spoke with Donna and we made plans to meet for dinner on Wednesday night. This works well for both of us. Now to make arrangements with Amy and Ian.</p>
<p>I phoned Paul to apologize for not wishing him Happy Birthday when he was by the other day, and to let him know there were some more things here for them. When he volunteered that he and Beth were having barbecued ribs for dinner, I had the audacity to suggest they invite UF over to join them... and that I bring over a potato to bake, but my sister never called back... </p>
<p>Steph' and John came by; John had forgotten his wallet here on Friday and they came in for a cold drink and looked at some of the photos... of AR and UF when they were young, and then of Glenn and Jan when they were first married. Neither could believe how skinny Glenn was and we gave them Glenn's group of sorted photos to take with them. It was such a pleasure for UF to have company here. He likes this young couple so much and would be happy to have them drop in any time at all. </p>
<p>Dinner was late tonight; somehow the hours just slipped by. UF suggested going out but we were ensconced with the photos and it seemed easier to just stay put. I cooked up some penne pasta, and sautéed garlic, mushrooms, chopped spinach, and fresh tomatoes, added a small can of Hunt's tomato paste, some herbs, and added a few tiny cubes of Havarti japelpeno cheese when I tossed it all together. We both really enjoyed it and UF is determined to learn how to make himself a dinner like this. I reassured him it was very easy and will make a few notes for him so that he can try it next week. </p>
<p>After dinner, UF went up to the computer room to scan the photos, etc. and I got busy chopping, and chopping, and chopping the rhubarb. The knife wasn't very sharp and there was a LOT of rhubarb, so I finished at 10:30 p.m. I cooked it all down, and now have a big pot to put into bags in the morning. </p>
<p>I tried unsuccessfully to call both Riku and Amelia today, but they were out partying I suppose, perhaps together. Riku goes back to nursery school tomorrow and I will be waiting to hear if he went in happily, or if there will be an adjustment period this term. Sometimes he would say "No school, no children" when school was mentioned so we shall see. </p>
<p>UF had been very quiet so I came up to see how he was doing, finding him sprawled out on his bed, with a book in hand, on the edge of sleep. I gently touched his shoulder, and he sat up, telling me he thought I had gone to bed without saying goodnight! When I told him I had sorted some more photos he came down for our glass of port and of course we got caught up in yet another batch of old black and whites, that AR had sorted into envelopes, hidden away for a few years. UF had totally forgotten about finding them after a robbery many many years ago of the originals so we had another wonderful hour looking at those and discarding lots of blurry or duplicates of coloured shots. </p>
<p>Argggh, bed at 2 a.m.! It's just too hard to pull ourselves away from this job, and we really must force ourselves to not get at it after 11 p.m. I read a few emails, quickly wrote a couple of short ones, and turned out my light at 2:15.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/tuesday_already.html">Tuesday Already!</a></h2>
								<p>Awoke at 8:30 today, not too late considering how late I went to bed this morning! Uncle Frank and I were competing for the shower at the same time today, the first time this has happened. I took a quick "navy" shower and let him have the hot water to himself downstairs. Ran a couple of washes through, as I had to iron a few blouses to get me through the next couple of days.</p>
<p>I made omelettes today, as we ate a bit late. We did take our time over breakfast which was good as we had a busy morning and early afternoon. While UF continued working on his labels, and spending far too long on the phone with Bell Canada, I packaged up fifteen lots of rhubarb for the freezer, made up two dessert dishes for UF, and then got busy cleaning out the fridge, and cleaning the fridge too. Beth called while I was doing this so I puffed away at her while continuing on; it is humid today so it was a hot job. </p>
<p>I admired UF's labels, which make a huge difference in being easy for him to read now in the dark cabinets. He had to fiddle a bit to get them just right and so is very pleased with the results. I vacuumed the floor after finishing the fridge, folded some laundry, emptied baskets for garbage night tonight, and somehow the afternoon flew by. </p>
<p>Gerry and Lionel picked me up at 3:15 for a trip to Costco. My intention was to buy all the plates, cups, etc. for the Boxing Day party, but it would take years to go through the numbers you have to buy. I'm hoping to do better at the dollar stores, when we get a chance to go. I did find a couple of birthday gifts though, so the trip was worthwhile and gave Gerry and I time to just wander around and catch up. </p>
<p>Back to Gerry's for tea and toast; I got to see lots of photos of her darling one-year-old grandson and his siblings. What a big boy he is... already thirty-five pounds at just a year old! Riku is now thirty pounds at almost three, but Tanner is an especially big boy. </p>
<p>By' was over with UF after work, helping him weed and we had planned to pick up fish and chips and eat at Gerry's. However, when we popped in, By' and UF were still busy raking and pulling weeds, so Gerry and I picked up the dinner and brought it here to eat. Delicious and fast! By' ate with us; Lionel was playing hockey and I threw away a lot of french fries. "A Fine Kettle of Fish" is very generous with their portions! </p>
<p>By' and Gerry left for home around 8:30, UF came back up to the computer to work on the photo we plan to send to Kay in England for identification, and I pulled out the photo boxes I had put away before leaving. And there I sat for two and a half hours, clearing out yet one more big box of photos. </p>
<p>Ian called during this time, and we made arrangements to go over for a visit on Thursday night. Glenn called and chatted with Uncle Frank and then with me. I wanted the name of the wonderful massage therapist Jan introduced me to many years ago; I think UF needs a good massage, and will see if he is game or not. Then I called Amy and Jake and made arrangements to have lunch with Amelia (as Amy prefers to be called now) on Thursday afternoon. Jake promised to make potato cakes tomorrow night, so that we can just heat them up for lunch. Can't wait! And I called and chatted with Marie for a bit too. </p>
<p>Guess I am not going to be in bed at midnight after all, but I am going down to have some port with UF and then shall call it a night. Busy and successful day here, and tomorrow will come early. </p>
<p>Signing off -- 1:15 a.m. -- after sitting with UF drinking our port and going through many, many more photos! One big plastic container now empty, although UF has to make some final decisions tomorrow morning on four big stacks of them. Night night!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/busy_wednesday.html">Busy Wednesday...</a></h2>
								<p>Well, I had a rude awakening this morning; the doorbell rang at 8:45 and it was the plumber. I had mentioned to Lionel that UF needed Jack to look at the bathroom tap, they apparently played hockey together last night, and he didn't let any time slide by. UF was still sleeping and continued to for another hour and a half. He was very surprised to waken to a working tap, although actually wanted the downstairs taps looked at as well. </p>
<p>We had a long list of errands to run today, and after our showers and a late breakfast, we made sure we had everything together for this outing... altogether we went to the bank, took back $87 in coins UF had rolled, went to two dollar stores to buy supplies for the Boxing Day sale, dropped off a trunkful of goodies to the Goodwill store, discovered a CD store where UF could sell off cds he no longer wants, went to the liquor store for port and a tall slim bottle of a light white wine, UF bougth a great lightweight Tilly hat that looks wonderful on him, stopped for a sandwich at a new-to-us deli sharing a tomato, cheese, and lettuce on a delicious soft ww roll, and an Italian orange drink (we will go there again; it's a terrific place with homemade everything!), went on to a stationery store for a stamp, and quarter coin rollers, and our last stop was at a men's store in the Square where I talked UF into buying a terrific Tilley hat for himself. Lionel had one on the other day, which looked so good on him. It was in a lighter fabric than the older canvas hats, and had a narrow brim, both of which UF prefers. I had told him about it, and since we were right there, and he really does need a decent hat, in we went. It took some persuation, as Auntie Rita objected to most of the summer hats in his collection, but after trying on several styles, he found one he quite liked. I liked it a lot and thought he looked very dapper in it, and now he has a hat that is guaranteed for life, and even has some insurance against loss. UF thinks he might just test this out by going down to the Falls on a windy day! </p>
<p>We dashed home to have a cup of tea after stopping at the Italian bakery on Sheldon Street, to buy some half ww Italian bread. I couldn't resist two Empire biscuits and two chewy cereal/oatmeal cookies too. Guess I was hungry. I did manage to resist though as it was too close to mealtime. </p>
<p>Sheldon and Donna had invited us for dinner at a restaurant, but before leaving their house we took some photos of them beside the sign in their yard that used to hang outside of the store that Mom and Dad ran. I was so happy to see it, and it is in a great spot on the back of the garage facing a lovely new stone patio. Their home is just beautiful, inside and out, and shows the care and time they have given it over the years. </p>
<p>We drove together to "Mick 'n Angelo's" on the lane for dinner. I had been here with AR and UF a few years ago, and then with UF last January and really enjoyed my meals there. UF did as well, and we were certainly not disappointed tonight. Donna suggested we order their garlic/cheese bread, and some stuffed mushrooms for appetizers. UF and I decided to share an entree of cheese-filled canneloni, and a green salad. Great choice! It was all so good and I ate one of the mushrooms even though I usually avoid seafood; this had shrimp, crab, and two different white fish. UF liked these so much he plans to go in on his own for dinner one night to order just the mushrooms and a slice of bread to soak up the juices. </p>
<p>We went back to Donna's and Shel's for "tea" but ended up with glasses of milky iced Godiva white chocolate liqueur. It was just wonderful, as we sipped away and chatted and laughed over our telling of our port and ice wine adventures. Donna ordered us to go home eventually as she said she couldn't take any more laughing. We had such a fun evening, but Shel' and Donna did have to get up in the morning, while UF and I could sleep as late as we pleased. At 10:30 p.m. we said goodnight and drove home, intending to get to bed early. Hah! It never happens and we sat up while UF had his Sleepytime tea, once again sorting through photos and getting hooked on getting through just one more envelope! </p>
<p>At 1 a.m. we said goodnight... and then I had trouble sleeping. I read, turned out the light, started thinking about supplies for Boxing Day!, and finally got up to take the Rescue Remedy drops I so strongly recommend to everyone else. They did the trick...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/two_visits_and_goodbye.html">Two Visits and Goodbye...</a></h2>
								<p>Awoke at 8 a.m. today and had a head start on my day... lots to do, so I answered a few emails, wrote a couple of blogs, did some laundry, sorted a few envelopes of photographs, ironed all my blouses and a couple of pairs of slacks, and tidied up a bit in the laundry room. By the time I had showered Uncle Frank was also ready for breakfast... eggs and toast for a treat today, with our half whole wheat Italian bread, toasted. Delicious! </p>
<p>Busy day again today, with lunch planned with Amelia/Amy, a haircut later on, and the evening with Ian. Uncle Frank decided to drive me out to Garner Road to Amy's so that he would have the car to run a few errands on his own. It was a lovely drive out there, and we were a little late arriving since we ran into some road work and had to detour. </p>
<p>Amelia looks great; we relaxed with a glass of white wine before having our lunch, cooked by Jake last night, as he is working the chip wagon today. He made the most delicious potato pancakes for us, tender and very tasty; we each had four of them(!) and ate a green salad while they were heating up. We chatted in their bright cozy rec' room, catching up on news of our children, grandchildren, and our plans for the next year or so. It was really lovely to have almost five hours together, as too often one of us has other plans and we are left with so much unsaid. Not today though, although we never run out of things to talk about! </p>
<p>UF was late picking me up as he ran into even more road work, but I had called to say I would be late for my appointment. I walked in at 4:30 and out at 5 p.m. UF picked me up and we dashed off to the cemetery first; we had been meaning to get there all week and I didn't want to leave without going there with UF. First we went to Mom's and Dad's which was covered in weeds. Mom would not have been happy! We had a little joke about her complaining as I pulled up the weeds. It took a while but I got every single last one, and then in the way I saw the Japanese do, got a nice big pail of water and poured it over the entire stone, front and back, which got all the dust off and made it gleam in the sunshine. UF suggested that I put down some plastic and then cover it with pink or white stones so I shall do that the next time I am there. </p>
<p>We went over to Auntie Rita's stone next, which is well-weeded and tended to, with large pots of mums in full bloom and a couple of artificial arrangements as well. I took photos of both, as I always do. </p>
<p>From there we scooted over to the bin store, where I bought almonds and cashews for Ian, and UF stocked up on some mixed nuts for himself. It was much later than we hoped by this time, and we still had to have dinner before going to Ian's. I put together a very quick corn and feta cheese omelette, using the cob from Amelia's garden, and added a side salad of greens and a lovely tomato from Amelia as well. I topped this with the cucumber dressing they gave us to sample from the deli and we both agreed it was delicious. </p>
<p>Ian was waiting for us when we pulled up at his house at 7:30; we went up to visit with him there. I gave him the book Doug had ordered for him, the nuts I just bought, and a big bag of fresh California pistachios (I intend to help him keep his weight up to 150 pounds; he looks great!), and UF had a couple of WW2 books for him too. We sat and chatted, Ian made tea and put out cookies as always, and the next couple of hours passed quickly. Ian is working six days a week, and has been busy with Lisa and her sister and friend, both of whom are visiting from England. About 9:30 we headed over there, meeting both these women, and enjoying our time in Lisa's home, our first visit there. She is so good for our brother, and of course I took lots of photos of everyone. </p>
<p>We said goodnight at 11 p.m. Ian has to be up early for work and UF and I still had groceries to buy! We stopped at the A&P near his house and did our shopping in the very quiet store. Susan had asked me to pick up some fruit and veggie bars for Amelia, and a clerk went out of her way to help us find those and the English custard UF needs for his rhubarb desserts this winter. </p>
<p>Of course we were both tired when we got home at almost midnight, and intended going to bed early, but as usual, had our glass of port, sat at the table sorting photos, and there went another two hours! Yikes! Bed at 2:15 this night... too late, but I wouldn't have changed a bit of it. </p>
<p>I'm off to Toronto in the morning at 11 a.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/niagara_falls_to_toronto_1.html">Niagara Falls to Toronto</a></h2>
								<p>Woke at 8 a.m. this morning, and even though I had not had nearly enough sleep decided to get up and start packing my bags. I was taking back far more than I came with, after buying a few things at the dollar stores, and relieving UF of some of his "clutter". </p>
<p>The two and a half hours passed quickly; the packing was out of the way soon enough, I showered and dressed, had time for a couple of quick emails, read Bryn's three latest blogs on days with Riku, got breakfast ready on the table, and still had time to sort through a drawer and some photos before sitting down with Uncle Frank. I also called and left a message for Beth saying goodbye. We only got to play cards once while I was home! </p>
<p>The bus left at 11:15 and I said a sad goodbye to Uncle Frank; I shall miss him, as our days passed quickly, getting so much accomplised, and yet we had lots of relaxed hours together as well. I may be back on Monday/Tuesday though... haven't quite decided. Bryn and Caillie will be at their Dad's and my friends may not be available here. </p>
<p>Kelly, with a bright CM t-shirt, which looks great on her, greeted me with a big smile and her hair cut shorter, about shoulder length and she looks terrific. Whatever was causing her to feel ill for weeks now has finally gone and she is feeling energetic and ready to get busy with her life again. She had to run an errand, we picked up a couple of tofu hot dogs, and picked up groceries on the way home. Those out of the way, a quick email check and it was time to walk to school to pick up the children. </p>
<p>It has been another gorgeous day here; I wish I had taken my camera with me, as the children all wore red today for their assembly, and looked such a bright group walking along with Manitou leading the way. I must do this another day. A photo op' for sure! </p>
<p>Myk' had a soccer game at 6 p.m., so it was a rush to get all four children's piano practice done, the dog walked, snack time served and eaten, and quiet reading time in as well, but we dashed out the door and drove to the soccer field. Caillie, Bryn, and Bryant had taken along skateboards and scooters and I went over and took far too many photos of them trying to catch them in mid-air, but with no luck at all. Caillie even faked a little jump for me, but I didn't catch that either. Myk's team meanwhile had scored two goals and the game ended with a tie. </p>
<p>Kelly and Gregg are off to a wedding in Oshawa tonight, so dinner was bought pizza rather than their usual Friday night homecrafted-pizza-by-Gregg night. Too bad; it is always so good, but perhaps there will be another opportunity before I leave Toronto. The children all ate five pieces of pizza each! I ate Caillie's crusts and a nice big serving of a most delicious fresh homegrown chopped tomatoes, two varieties, feta cheese, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar dressed salad, with home-grown basil as well. I love this and plan to eat lots of tomatoes while I am here. Kelly also has fresh tomato sauce made up in the fridge and a container of her homemade pesto too. I love fall in Ontario! </p>
<p>Uncle Frank had given me a movie, so after Kelly and Gregg left, we all sat down to watch it. I fell asleep during parts of it! I wasn't surprised, as I have had some very late nights and didn't get nearly enough sleep last night. The children were tucked in at 9:30; I tidied up the kitchen, wrote a couple of emails, tried to annotate some photos, but couldn't figure out how to access them to do so. Too tired anyway so it's just as well. It just seemed very odd to be thinking of going to bed at 10:15! It's now forty-five minutes later and I am ready to crawl into bed with Caillie and read... and sleep.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/busy_day_quiet_evening.html">Busy Day, Quiet Evening...</a></h2>
								<p>Caillie and I were wakened by Kelly at 8:30 this morning, both snuggled in together with the fan blowing on us. Myk's soccer game was at 10 a.m., so we all had breakfast, took our water bottles with us, and off we went. Bryant, Bryn, and Caillie took along their skateboards and/or scooters and I watched them do their stuff for a while and then sat and watched Myk's game. The score was 5-0 for the other team. We came right home with lots to do; Kelly and Gregg dashed out for an hour plus to pick up birthday gifts, the children all did their piano practice, played with Manitou, did some homework, and read, as well as perused the huge neighbourhood garage sale. I made grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch (I had a generous bowl of the tomato salad Kelly had made for me last night, along with some crusty seeded bread to dip in the juices) in the midst of their busy three hours, and we were all ready to leave for game number two when Kelly and Gregg arrived home at 3:35. </p>
<p>It was a little cooler this afternoon, although the sun was still shining. Bryn took along the huge frisbee he bought for fifty cents, and he, Bry', Caillie, and I tossed it around for a while. Myk's team lost 3-2, which meant it was the end of the team's participation in the playoffs. </p>
<p>At the end of the game the children and I were standing waiting for Kelly to finish chatting with a friend. There was a young eight year old boy on his skateboard nearby doing some tricks with his board; I asked him how old he was and whether he had taken lessons. He hadn't, but said he loved trying new things and practiced a lot; he showed me how he could jump on his board, turn it over and land on it as it flipped over. Bry' watched with interest, tried it out, and then tried again and again, until he too could almost do it. By the time we left he could also do this, almost every time! I was very impressed. Bry' had a couple of lessons for his birthday and his teacher thought he had a natural ability there; it was obvious that this is true. </p>
<p>Back at home, we all had various things to do... Bryn played with Manitou, Caillie made a card for Mary Ellen, Myk' made a card for Emma, and she and Bry' packed up their suits for the swimming party tonight. Bry' and I also looked at some of the photos from spring break in California before they all left together at 4 p.m.</p>
<p>A very exciting things happened today... the first was seeing Mykayla play the piano backwards! She was sitting near the table facing it, and just for the heck of it, put her hands behind her and started playing a tune, one of her songs from her lessons. She was just amazing! It obviously required more than a bit of concentration; she played it a few times, and each time I was just astounded! Can't wait to show Kelly and Gregg tomorrow. </p>
<p>I was on my own for the evening and had plenty to do... started the wash, unpacked the two bags from the Falls, sorted out the gifts from here from the gifts to go back to SF, put away my pressed clothes, and sorted the clothes that need ironing for the following week. I also answered a few emails from Gail, made myself a delicious dinner of mushrooms, "chicken", and spinach, eating it sitting on the sofa reading. I did three loads of laundry and then took Manitou for a forty-minute walk at 7:30. All was in order, the kitchen tidied, and I was ready to sit down, just as Gail called for a nice long chat. </p>
<p>Gregg, Kelly, Myk', and Bry' arrived home at 10:30, tired after a busy but fun day. I won't be up late tonight and am so pleased that I got all the things done I intended to do.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/a_long_walk_and_early_to_bed.html">A Long Walk and Early to Bed</a></h2>
								<p>Had a lovely long sleep-in today. Today is the practice day for the Dyment/Feldmann/Tilston crew's hike in the Grand Canyon, three weeks from now. Kelly dashed off at 10 a.m. to pick up Bryn and Caillie from their sleepovers; Gregg had made sandwiches, I boiled eggs, we filled water bottles (two each), took along carrots and celery, packed it all into backpacks, and headed off down the Danforth, on our way to Bloor Street. Manitou joined us too.</p>
<p>Kelly and Gregg were not sure how long it would take us to walk 6 miles, as the children haven't walked that far in a single stretch. we were walking along busy streets, and it was hot; Caillie had problems with her shoes, which don't fit closely to her foot, and with her backpack as well. She needed lots of stops and the rest of us stopped for bathroom breaks, to fetch a sandwich, a drink, and near the end we shared popsicles too. I'm sure they would be a hit if available on the way up from the Canyon! We traded walking partners along the way, and had a very successful walk indeed. We called a halt at the five and a half mile mark (9km); we had walked for three hours, not a bad first run for the crew. </p>
<p>Mykayla had to be at the sports field for her soccer tournament trophy event, and so we caught the subway home and took the van to the field. It was hot and we were happy to find shade to stand in while the trophies were being handed out. Myk' sat happily with her teammates eating pizza and drinking pop, before we headed back home. </p>
<p>Home for homework, piano practice, quiet reading time, and dinner. Gregg did a barbecue with ribs, grilled zucchini and asparagus, and boiled corn. I made up a dish with spinach and "chicken" and thoroughly enjoyed our dinner outdoors. Showers followed for all of the children, and it was an early night for them all. What a busy and fun, eventful weekend we had!  </p>
<p>I had been thinking of the camping trip that Susan, Kevin, Amelia, Riku, Bryn, Brent, Miya, Ivonne, Troy, and Diego had been on, and hoping to see lots of photos. Before going to bed I called Riku and heard a little bit about sleeping in tents, and a big fire, and lots of giggles from my little guy too! Bryn even managed to get his unedited photos out to me, which was so kind of him. They were wonderful and it looked as though everyone had a great time. </p>
<p>Night night...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/take_me_out_to_the_ball_game.html">Take Me Out to the Ball Game!</a></h2>
								<p>Monday, Monday. I dashed into the shower quickly, Kelly followed, and we walked the children to school. Hot, hot, hot! Kelly decided we needed the air conditioner on since it was so humid, and this made it possible for me to clean the window in the upstairs bathroom. We've been meaning to do this for some time, and while Kelly went off for passports, expecting a long lineup, I got busy cleaning. This window was a cinch to clean, as both windows slide down and then open towards me, making it very easy to clean both sides. The screen had a good soaking in the tub, after which the tub needed a thorough cleaning too. I wiped down the walls, the cabinets and decided to leave the floor for tomorrow. It was hot! </p>
<p>Kelly called to say she was on her way home, finishing up hours sooner than she expected! Caillie called just minutes later to say Myk' and Miya had forgotten about her, so off I dashed to intercept them. They headed back to school, Kelly met up with me, and off she went to collect them all. Ah, the joys of four schedules! </p>
<p>We had lunch outside, competing with the wasps, which wasn't much fun at all. It was a hot sweaty walk back to school at 12:30 and a delight to come back into the AC'd house. Kelly brought the ironing board up for me, as it was cool enough to iron, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching TV while ironing. Makes the time go by so much faster! </p>
<p>After the normal after-school routine -- snacks, piano practice for Bryn and Caillie, and lessons for Myk' and Bry' -- and a quick grilled cheese dinner for Bryn and Caillie, Uncle Mark joined us for the subway ride to the Dome. He had treated us all to the tickets, and we picked up Caillie's friend Ursula on our way. </p>
<p>We had great seats, and Bry', Myk' and Gregg joined us a half hour later, just as the game started. It was a beautiful night, and thank goodness a little cooler as the night wore on. The Dome was open to the clear night air, and the Toronto Blue Jays were playing the Boston Red Socks. Bryn patiently explained the game to me, Caillie and Ursula were totally involved in their own little worlds of purses, treats provided by Ursula, many trips to the bathroom, and the concession stands. Myk' is an avid fan, and watches the game as closely as the adults did. Gregg treated us to peanuts, and we actually all stood and stretched at one point and sang "Take Me Out to the Ball Game", with vigour, and enjoyed the evening so much. </p>
<p>It was running late with the game tied at 5 all when we decided to leave; it was 10:20 at that point and Ursula had to be home at 11 p.m. Gregg dropped his children at home, Kelly took Bryn and Caillie to Hans', while Mark and I took the subway home. We had been tempted to stay and see how it ended but were glad we left with everyone else. </p>
<p>We were all very tired; the heat certainly saps me of energy and it had been a busy day. All of us were in bed within a half hour of getting home. I thoroughly enjoyed the outing; a ball game is a rare event for me, and this was my second baseball game at the Dome, both compliments of Mark.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/hot_humid_toronto.html">Hot Humid Toronto!</a></h2>
								<p>We had the AC running today and all night too; I just heard on the news that the humidex today made it seem like it was 39C even though it was <em>only</em> 29. Tomorrow will be even hotter and then a cold front is expected; I wouldn't mind it being a tad cooler but a "cold front" sounds ominous. </p>
<p>I spent the whole of today in the house except for one walk to school with Kelly at 3:30 to meet Myk' and Bryant. I was glad to get back inside. </p>
<p>So, here was my day... woke at 8:45! to find that Bry' and Myk' were already at school, and Kelly and Gregg were snuggled in bed as well. Gregg had crawled in with Kelly after getting the children off to school, and the phone woke them at 9:05. What a lazy morning it was for us around here. Emails, a chat with Doug on Skype, and washing the bathroom floor and walls finished up my morning. We had lunch together in the living room (I had tomato salad and the end of the beet salad... so good, both of them), chatting, and then Kelly dashed off for a CM meeting while I turned on the TV and did some mending. Kelly had a nice big stack waiting for me and it was great to sit, have my tea, watch Oprah, and then a "Home with Baby" show, which I enjoyed as well. </p>
<p>Off to pick up the children, and down to help Kelly clean and straighten up the CM room, as there was a crop going on down there tonight. We did a great job and Kelly got so much done; she sorted out and threw lots out while I organized the pop, candy, and extra supply shelf. We worked hard while the children did their piano practice and read for a half hour each. </p>
<p>Gregg made dinner, which we stopped for at 6:45... hamburgers (I had spicy "beef" with mushrooms and spinach), corn on the cob, and grilled zucchini and asparagus. We ate outside; the air was beginning to cool off, so it was very pleasant. </p>
<p>Kelly and I went back down to do a little more organizing before the three gals came in at 7:30 for the crop. Kelly dealt with the various piles of things needing to be organized, while I checked emails and finished up a blog. At 9 p.m. I went downstairs and sorted out the photos from Kelly, Bryn, and Caillie's visit to San Francisco in March of 2003. It was such fun seeing Bryn, Caillie, and Riku from two years ago! We started a second Power Sort box since Kelly still has a huge box of photos from Gregg to organize. </p>
<p>The last two gals left at 10:45, Kelly and I put everything away, and now it's time to head upstairs... at 11:40 p.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/wednesday_already.html">Wednesday Already!</a></h2>
								<p>All day today it felt like Tuesday to me; my time here is going all too quickly! I was up and in the shower at 7:15 today, wanting to be ready for the day earlier than I was yesterday. </p>
<p>Bry' and Myk' went off to school at 8:20, as Myk' is responsible for doing the announcements on the PA system this week. I had a quick breakfast with Kelly and then at 9 a.m. she went off with Manitou and Jake, a neighbour's dog, for a two-plus-hour walk with Camila, a weekly tradition. I got busy washing the downstairs bathroom floor and walls, and the kitchen floor. The AC is still on, which is a good thing as it is still hot and humid outside today. A rain storm was promised for later today. </p>
<p>Caillie called from school at 10 a.m. saying she had hurt her arm; I went over to pick her up and called Kelly once we were home. Apparently Caillie was doing this quite a bit last year, deciding on Wednesday that she would rather have more time with her mom than just their lunch hour (it's just the two of them here on Wednesdays), so Kelly was not happy to hear that she was doing this again. Caillie was upstairs in her room while I finished cleaning, and by the time I had the tuna ready for their traditional "tuna melt" lunch, Kelly was home as well. </p>
<p>Gregg joined us for lunch and we decided we wouldn't battle with the wasps today; Caillie doesn't enjoy it one bit. She sat with a list of classmates and friends she wanted to invite to her birthday party, to be held after Bryn's soccer matches on Saturday. We just found out this morning when they were being held, so it's short notice for the party. </p>
<p>We walked her off to school, then I sat and had my tea, continuing on with the last of the mending, and answering the occasional email. Liz called around 3:45 and we had a long chat, while I sat up in the master bedroom. The children were home for snacks, although Kelly and Mykayla went off with Caillie, who was having blue extensions put in her hair as an early birthday present. She isn't allowed, of course!, to colour her hair, as is quite the trend these days, but is thrilled to have the chance to have blue streaks. They look great and I will get some closeup shots of them for the record. </p>
<p>The usual routine of homework, piano, quiet reading time for the children and some fun time on the computer and tossing a ball outside followed. We did get quite a cloudburst though, earlier in the afternoon, and Kelly got wet bringing in the bikes. Gregg got the grass cut just in time for the soaking it needed. </p>
<p>Bryn was to have had soccer practice tonight, and Gregg a meeting over the dinner hour, but both were cancelled. Gregg put together shepherd's pie for dinner; I used some leftovers, and had pasta with fresh tomatoes, grilled zucchini and asparagus, plus pesto and tofu cubes, all tossed together and heated up. It was delicious and really hit the spot. </p>
<p>After dinner, Kelly and Caillie planned Caillie's party; Kelly had called all the parents during the afternoon and all but two of the nine children are able to come with the other two still to be heard from. Caillie was a tired girl today, part of the reason for her wanting to be home with her mom, so off she went to bed at 7 p.m. to read with her. </p>
<p>I'm missing the two little ones, and called them both tonight. Amelia was ready for her bath but happily chatted away at me; how her speaking has changed! She is talking so very well, and so clearly; it was great fun just listening to her and we did lots of back and forth chatting too, about camping, and the stars, and her swimming lesson tomorrow... lots of detail. </p>
<p>Talked with Doug briefly, trying to decide where I needed to start in ordering my prints; he was dashing off to a book reading so I heard briefly that Riku had a cold and a runny nose. Poor sweet baboo. </p>
<p>I spoke with him a little earlier than usual. He was sneezing and sounded stuffy, but we talked and I sang him a few songs. Riku didn't want to sing to me, although Akane told me tonight that they are learning some songs in English at his school, much to our surprise. Riku does them along with the actions and really loves to sing. I could hear him in the background singing away as I spoke with Akane. </p>
<p>I got started on my online photo order and will finish that up tomorrow... Kelly is feeling rotten and has shut down the machine downstairs so I am on my way up to bed... at 10:50 p.m. tonight.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/i_love_my_life_bdf.html">"I Love My Life" ... BDF</a></h2>
								<p>Cool morning, hot humid afternoon, and a lovely cool evening; welcome to fall in Ontario. I arose early this morning, at 6:30, and came downstairs to answer emails before the household awakened. Myk' came down first, at 7:15, all dressed and ready to head to school early for her morning announcement duties. Bry' followed, then Brynnie, and they all went off to school early, walking with Gregg and Manitou. </p>
<p>Caillie had a tough morning, not happy with what her clothes choices were. Kelly had to use all of her patience to get her down here for breakfast and a quick walk to school. The rest of her day was much better! </p>
<p>I played ball with Manitou in the alley this morning, as Kelly had a meeting in the neighbourhood. It's amazing how often he manages to catch it, despite my erratic throwing. </p>
<p>Only Caillie and Bryn were home for lunch today; Myk' and Bry' both had lunchtime activities at school. Kelly made mac' 'n cheese and I put spinach and mushrooms in mine, as well as a whole tomato from the garden. It was so good! </p>
<p>The afternoon flew by; I cleaned out the silverware drawer, started cleaning the outside of the kitchen cabinets, and spent too much time on my photo-ordering project. I had some questions, and after some time was given a credit for three months down the road; this is perfect as ordering them will be much easier from home, with access to dates, etc. Whew! </p>
<p>Bryn had soccer after school, and Myk' and Bry' were to go to their mom's early, so Kelly, Caillie, and I went off on a quick shoe-buying trip for Caillie. We were successful, and Kelly found shoes for Myk' too; we picked up a couple of extra items at Zeller's and bought a few groceries while we were out. After dropping Caillie at her piano lesson, we again dashed home, then took Bryn to his lesson, picking up Caillie! ... what a dash today. Home again, picked Bryn up... and on the way out to the car Bryn told Kelly, "I love my life!". What a lovely statement to hear from him! </p>
<p>We came home to a delicious pesto pasta dinner prepared by Gregg. We ate outside &mdash; it was perfect tonight with no wasps &mdash; and then Gregg took Bryn off to his second practice of the day, taking Manitou with him too. </p>
<p>Caillie's birthday is on Saturday, so tomorrow is the day for her to take cupcakes in to her class. Caillie, being Caillie, has decided she also wants to give one to each of her former teachers too, so as soon as dinner was over she and I got busy in the kitchen. We made the batter together for Susan Mendelson's wonderful chocolate cake recipe, and then wrapped 48 pennies in foil. Caillie also decided it would be very nice if everyone got a treat in the cupcakes, even those who are not invited to her party. She measured and scooped, beat and stirred, broke the eggs, added the milk, etc. until we had a nice big bowl of yummy smelling chocolate batter. </p>
<p>I scooped in a half measure of the batter, Caillie placed a foil wrapped coin in the middle, and she filled the cups to the top. Off she went to bed at 7:15, a tired but happy girl. Instead of a bedtime story tonight, she and her mommy discussed the "Survivor" games she will have at her party on Saturday. </p>
<p>Bryn came in hot and sweaty from his practice, had one of the warm cupcakes, and headed up to shower. He came downstairs, helped me wrap the rest of the coins, placed them in the cups for me, and licked the beaters. I know he was hoping the bowl would be empty before he went to bed, but I still had three more pans to cook... twelve at a time, times four! Kelly had two and agreed that they were delicious; I think we are down to 42 now. I will ice them tomorrow morning for delivery to the class after lunch. </p>
<p>It took a while to clean up the kitchen; I did two more loads of laundry, and was happy to sit down with Kelly and watch TV for an hour, chatting during commercials. Gregg had gone off to meet a fellow who is going to dogsit Manitou when they are away in October, and came home bearing a two-man tent, very small, and a great backpack to borrow. Two items down, two to go! </p>
<p>I called Riku at 7:30 his time; I had Kelly talk to him and she immediately sang two songs along with him, listened to him sing "Itsy Bitsy Spider" and "Down at the Station" as well as "ABC"... they chatted quite a while and then I had a few minutes with him before he had to go to bed. "Bye sweetheart" and "I love you" are sweet words to hear before bedtime. He did say he was still sick; I hope his cold is over soon. </p>
<p>Off to bed at 11 p.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/the_end_of_another_week.html">The End of Another Week!</a></h2>
								<p>Caillie and I both awoke at 7:20 this morning. She asked what time it was, and then told me I had time to "draw" pictures on her back so she could guess what they were. I drew some cupcakes and she guessed "cakes" which was close enough, and then I dropped off back to sleep while drawing eight candles. However, when she came bounding back into bed after dashing downstairs for a minute, and told me her mom had told her we could go back to sleep!, I knew it was time to get up. </p>
<p>I quickly made up some delicious chocolate icing and iced forty-two cupcakes before we left for school at 8:30, all of us walking in a little bit of drizzle. We were expecting a heavy rainfall today, which didn't bode well for Bryn's soccer game tonight. We were back home for only twenty-five minutes; I answered a couple of emails, and then we drove over for Kelly to do call-backs at the school. That finished at 10 a.m., we delivered 33 cupcakes to Caillie in her classroom. She had a substitute teacher there today, who was very happy to see us on this rainy day recess period. Kelly lit eight candles, we all sang "happy birthday to Caillie, and we gave paper towels to the children, while Caillie took the trays around to each of them, and the teacher too of course. </p>
<p>Caillie also wanted to give them out to her favourite teachers, which meant all of them!, and to the principal, the vice-principal, and her gym teacher. She warned each of them about the hidden "surprise" in the center of them, so no one would swallow a penny. I took a few photos as this may be the last year Caillie feels comfortable doing this. </p>
<p>Kelly had a few CM deliveries to make; we came home and ate, and got busy with our various projects. I called Vicky and made arrangements to see her on Monday at 10:15, I emptied the dishwasher and tidied up a bit. Lounged around for a bit watching Oprah, drinking my tea, walked over with Kelly to pick up Myk' and Bry', gave extra cupcakes to Bryn and Caillie, and dropped them off at Hans'. </p>
<p>Myk' and Bry' left with their mom at 5 p.m. after practicing the piano, and somehow Kelly, Gregg, and I ended up feeling very lazy. I'm sure the heavy rain didn't help our energy level a bit. I ordered a pizza for my dinner, which Gregg and Kelly picked up when they got their chicken souvlaki. </p>
<p>Bryn called while they were gone, which was a lovely surprise, as I haven't heard his voice since arriving home. Of course I heard a couple of cute Riku stories... Riku was eating goldfish crackers and Bryn asked him if he could have the broken one he spotted. Riku agreed to this and Bryn ate it up. Then he spotted a second one, with only a quarter of the little fish cracker in one piece, and asked if he could have it too. Riku's answer: "No, that is Riku's broken cracker."! And the second one... Bryn asked Riku if he could help him build a tower of blocks and Riku replied "No, it is bedtime". Bryn is busy working on putting all of his photos up in a Web site, so just in case he doesn't have time to make a note of these Riku quotes, I have made sure they aren't forgotten! </p>
<p>Vicky had told me this morning that the season's premier SuperNanny was on tonight, so I sat upstairs watching that, and eating three pieces of pizza, while Kelly and Gregg watched their favourite "Big Brother" show, not being happy with the result of the ending. </p>
<p>I called Susan to suggest that she tape it, but they don't get it so I am hoping that Doug did so. It was worth seeing twins refusing to go to sleep! and how the problem was solved. The bonus of the call though, was that I got to say "hello" to Amelia, and have a little chat with her. She was asking "watch TV?" which I was doing and which I believe she was hoping to talk her mommy into letting her do as well. I had an "I love you" from her and a sweet "night night". Home in two weeks today... seems a long time in so many ways...  </p>
<p>And we ended the night watching a taped show that Sherri and Carl had given them, a sweet Italian film called "For Roseanna" or something close to that. I, of course, curled up in the corner of their very comfortable leather sofa, with a full tummy, and nice and warm, nodded off here and there, so I plan to take it home with me so that Doug can see it; perhaps I will nod off in different places with the second viewing! </p>
<p>And our plans for tomorrow have completely changed, due to the rain. Caillie's party for her friends was to have been at Hans' house, with Kelly in charge of the cake, loot bags, and games. Because of Bryn's game being cancelled tonight, he is now playing three games tomorrow, at 10 a.m., 1 p.m., and 5 p.m., the latter being in the middle of Caillie's party. So, Hans will take Bryn to his last game, and the party will be here instead. This is so much more convenient as we won't have to take everything over to Hans' place, awkward with the cupcakes and party favours and all the snacks, etc. So we're happy about the change, although disappointed that we won't see Bryn's last game of the season. However, tomorrow may bring yet more changes so we shall see how it all turns out. </p>
<p>Bedtime at 11:45 p.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/caillie_is_eight.html">Caillie is Eight!</a></h2>
								<p>Happy birthday to Caillie, eight years old today. She called this morning and we all sang "happy birthday" to her; she says she feels exactly the same as she did yesterday. </p>
<p>It was such a busy day today, from the time we woke up until we collapsed on the sofa at 7:15 p.m. </p>
<p>My first duty was to make white cupcakes with pink icing. I made one batch, as we didn't have enough eggs in for two, and because I didn't use Pam, they stuck terribly to the cupcake pans. What a disaster! I managed to salvage two out of a dozen. Gregg went to the corner store for more eggs, so I got those made up and in the oven before leaving at 9:40 for Bryn's first soccer game of the day. I had to turn the oven off and leave them and must admit I thought they too would be a disaster; they were already in the pan before Kelly told me about the Pam. </p>
<p>It was perfect weather for the game, not too hot and not too cool. Bryn's team lost the first game and with two to go we worried they might lose heart for the remaining games. The children went home with their Dad, Kelly and Gregg went to buy loot bag goodies and snacks, and I made the pink icing. Thank goodness the second batch was just fine; they had pulled away from the pan and tipped out perfectly for me. Whew! I had to use two of the others but once covered with icing you could not tell how mangled they were! </p>
<p>I made grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch for Kelly and Gregg, and I wolfed down a bowl of the leftover pesto pasta from the other night; we were all really hungry as we hadn't had time for breakfast this morning. Rush, rush, rush! </p>
<p>This second game was not quite so comfortable as the sun was beating down on us; their was cloud cover though and we were grateful for it when it appeared. It is a pleasure sitting on the grass watching these young boys, who have become very proficient over the years (this is Bryn's eight season!), but alas they lost to a better team this afternoon. Kelly and Gregg said they have been much better at passing in past games so they seem a bit off the game today. Bryn hurt his arm and sat out the last of this game. </p>
<p>The game started late, Kelly was worrying about not having things organized for the eleven extra children arriving at 3:30. We left the game just a little hour ahead of their arrival! However, everything went very smoothly. Gregg got busy organizing the various activities for the "Survivor" theme Caillie had decided on a couple of days ago, I got the "treats" out, Bryn and I blew up yellow balloons and hung them from the table outside, Bryn put the loot bags together, Caillie decorated her cupcakes, and Kelly dashed about taking care of all the other details... hauling out winter coats, boots, scarves, mittens, and overpants. </p>
<p>What a great and successful party this was. The girls played in the back yard for a half hour and then the "Survivor" games got underway. Twelve children drew slips of paper which put them on either the blue team or the yellow team. The first event was hilarious; there were two sets of the above winter clothing and each contestant, one from each team, had to dress as quickly as possible, tying the scard once, run up the back lane to Bryn, give him a "high five", dash back, undress, and then stand on a wastepaper basket until one of them fell off. I took lots of photos of this event, since everyone was laughing so hard which made it even harder to run in those awkward clothes. </p>
<p>The next "event" was a "mystery food" puzzle. Gregg had set up two sets of five bowls filled with interesting textures; one set was in the living room and one in the dining room. One member of each team was blindfolded and then led to the bowls. In the bowls were three "fingers" of cold watermelon, cold creamed corn, a bowl of sticky cooked and cooled oatmeal, dog kibble, and a hard boiled egg, shelled. The oatmeal and the creamed corn got the most "oooh, this is disgusting!" Most of the children guessed the egg, and most did not guess more than two correctly. It was great fun to see them look at them all once their masks were removed. </p>
<p>Following this was a "how well do you know the party girl?" quiz. Kelly had a long list of questions made up, the teams sat in the yard opposite each other, with their own paper and a marker. "What time does Caillie go to bed?" was one of the questions, with three choices. The correct answer was 7:30 p.m. and one team guessed correctly. "How many pets does Caillie have", "where was Caillie born?", "how many plane flights has she been on?"... sixteen!, and "what is her favourite colour?"... purple now, used to be yellow. </p>
<p>While this was going on, Gregg was again busy in the kitchen, making up six plates of covered food. The teams lined up at the dining table, each chose a number which corresponded to a number on the cover of the food, and then proceeded to eat, as quickly as possible, the food on the plate using only their tongues! The guests were allowed to pass it on to another team mate if they chose to, and a couple did just that. It was all junior baby food... carrots, banana puree, applesauce, sweet potato, chocolate pudding, and I believe butterscotch pudding but of course they didn't know what they were for certain until they tasted it. They all loved this, especially the more adventurous of the groups. </p>
<p>Caillie announced at the end of this event that this had been her very favourite party ever! Quite the compliment, and the adults enjoyed it every bit as much as she did. </p>
<p>Bryn left reluctantly at 4:35 to play his last game. Uncle Mark and Hans went with him, but I know Bryn would have been happy to forget about it, especially as his arm was a bit sore and he was hot and tired. However, he played the last game of the season, and once again his team lost. It was such a disappointment but Bryn takes it in good stride. </p>
<p>Caillie sat on the steps as she opened her gifts, with the child giving the gift sitting beside her. This worked very nicely as they all had a good view of the gifts, and then the attention was on their gift as well. Caillie handed out the treat bags, very cute little cloth purses filled with goodies. </p>
<p>I was ready for a little quiet time and locked myself upstairs until all the children but ours had left. They went with Mark over to Hans' immediately since they had dinner reservations at a Japanese restaurant on the Danforth. Bryn was looking forward to an egg dish he has recently discovered, and said he would have a tofu dish as well. </p>
<p>Gregg, Kelly, and I got busy cleaning up both inside and outside. We made quick work of it although there was lots to do. Finally we all collapsed on the sofa, watching tv, and feeling too tired to move. It had been a very busy day from the time we got up until then. Thank goodness for Gregg who somehow summoned up enough energy to start cooking dinner. We didn't even ask what he was making, as we thought he planned to surprise us, but it smelled so good... tomatoes and ???</p>
<p>A half hour later a most delicious canneloni dish was ready for us, with fresh parmesan to top it off. We sat in the living room enjoying every single bite of it, and Kelly and I shared the last piece of it. </p>
<p>I called and spoke with Riku who answered the phone; he was watching "Toy Story", his daddy was not with him, and he asked me to sing him "the whale song" and I sang the alligator song too. He sounded tired and coughed a couple of times; it was 7:15 in SF, which meant 10:15 here. We all headed up to bed at 11 p.m., and I turned out my light at 11:35, after reading another couple of chapters in my Annie Proulx book. It's a collection of cowboy stories, set in Wyoming, I believe, and very well written; I am trying hard to have it read in time to give to Ian when I am in the Falls next.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/sunday_not_a_day_of_rest.html">Sunday, Not a Day of Rest!</a></h2>
								<p>Today was a great day, as I accomplished a job that was one of three big ones on my "list". But first, our morning. There were no children here today, and it was a lazy morning for me. I arose at 9 a.m. after reading in bed for a bit, my very favourite way to start off any day. Kelly went off for her first run in a while, a three miler, having had a rotten bug during the summer that kept her off her running schedule for too long. Gregg left at the same time with Manitou for their usual Sunday morning in the park routine, after stopping at Starbuck's for a coffee (for Gregg). They met up at 11:30 at the park and walked home together. I was lazing about, although did throw in a load of laundry before getting to some emails. </p>
<p>Gregg got right to work in the kitchen, making what has become their standard Sunday brunch dish when they are on their own... a most delicious stuffed croissant, with "ham" and Swiss cheese for me, and real ham and cheese for them. He dips into a seasoned French toast mixture, and then fries it slowly on the stovetop, until it has melted and is puffed up. It is <strong>so</strong> good! I had a cup of tea to finish off, and then we all went to work. </p>
<p>Gregg has been wanting to reorganize the shelves in the basement to make them more easily accessible; they had pulled much of the storage things out of the room looking for something the day before so that gave him the incentive to just get to it. He worked really hard all afternoon, figuring out how to make the shelves stable, despite not having found studs in the walls. Just before dinner we went down to admire this well-done job; he was determined to get it done before leaving for Ottawa tomorrow and he did it. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kelly and I were both working on the second floor, on different projects. Kelly had pulled everything out of the storage closet in the master bedroom to access the winter clothing articles for the party yesterday, and the room was filled with the contents of the closet. This was her opportunity to go through bags of clothes, and fill two bags with donations for the Katrina drive next Sunday. I took some of Caillie's clothing for Amelia one day, Kelly tossed and eliminated and finally — after a couple of hours — had it all done and was able to sit and do some CM work in a very tidy and organized room. </p>
<p>The children came by for their bikes and of course it was lovely to see them when I wasn't expecting to. Uncle Mark came by as well, and Kelly gave him some tomato salad for his lunch tomorrow. He was going with Caillie to the toy store to buy something with her birthday gift certificate from him. I suggested to Bryn, since he was going to be on his own for a bit, that he stay and help me with his room, but he realized quite suddenly, it seemed to me, that he did have other plans already.  :)</p>
<p>It was hot enough that I didn't want to work on the third floor, on the girls rooms, so decided to do Bryn and Bry's second floor room instead. I started by washing the window, which really needed the attention. It wasn't done last year as I didn't think I could get it down past the huge wardrobe in their room, but Kelly realized if we took the knobs off it might work. It did, and it looked great when I finished. These windows are marvellous as they slide inwards making it very easy to access both sides. All windows should be this easy! And from there I went on to removing every single item from the shelving unit, dusting and washing the shelves, turning the mattresses, pulling out the bed and washing the baseboards and the floor, and ending by pulling off the bedding. It looks terrific too and I was very pleased with it. </p>
<p>By this time we were all hungry; Kelly had suggested that Gregg do her favourite stuffed chicken breasts, Kelly made a wonderful fresh-from-the-garden tomato salad, with their basil and mint from down the alleyway, topped with feta cheese. Meanwhile, I made up a mushroom, red onion, lots of spinach, and garlic mixture and cooked it up with some spicy "beef" I had bought. </p>
<p>At 8 p.m. we all sat down in front of the TV, watching a bit of the Emmy awards while we ate; it was so good. Oh, the chicken was stuffed with goat cheese and spinach and then barbecued. However, Kelly and I both felt we needed just a little extra something and drove out for a loaf of Italian bread to soak up the juices from our second helping of the tomato salad. I <strong>love</strong> being in Ontario in September, especially when there are tomatoes growing right outside the back door! </p>
<p>I did a couple of additional loads of laundry, and mended two more of Caillie's summer tops while we relaxed and watched about half of the first "Oceans 11".</p>
<p>I called Riku at 10:15 p.m. (my time... 7:15 for him) and caught him in the tub; Bryn was there with him, but I talked with Riku about his carousel ride in Golden Gate park with Amelia today and we sang the alphabet song together. He sings it so very well! and of course does the "lmnop" line as one word, as is typical for this run. I also sang the Baby Beluga song to him before saying "goodnight sweetheart" and hearing it back from Riku. </p>
<p>We all headed upstairs at 10:30, feeling mighty pleased with ourselves. Gregg leaves for Ottawa in the morning and I read until midnight.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/monday_in_toronto.html">Monday in Toronto</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke too early today, at 6:20 a.m., so turned on the light, read for ten minutes and drifted back into a deep sleep for an hour and a half extra. Lovely! </p>
<p>Kelly drove Gregg off to the car rental at 8 a.m., and I dashed around getting ready to meet Vicki. Manitou needed a quick trip down the alleyway before going off with a friend of Kelly's and her dog, for a long run with them both. I did some ironing, folded a load of clothes, and quickly ate some cold cereal before leaving the house at 10 a.m. Subway to Eglinton, to Indigo where I was to meet Vicki, and where I picked up a couple of birthday/Christmas gifts for the SF children. </p>
<p>Vicki and I walked over to her daughter Cathy's house on this perfectly wonderful fall day. Cath' and Mike live across from a big park and as we approached we could see Cath' and six-month old Will' on a blanket on the lawn. What a beautiful smiley boy he is! I held him after getting lots of smiles from him, with a wide smile and teeth just bursting to emerge. Cath' is lovely, and exactly the mom I knew she would be... big smiles for her little guy every time she looked at him, or he at her. He loves his "Grandy" too, although Cath' was kind enough to say he obviously loves grandmas as he gave us lots of attention and wasn't the least bit shy with me. We visited for a good hour plus, and of course I took lots of photos! Can't wait to see them! </p>
<p>Vicki treated me to a wonderful Italian lunch... a glass of Niagara-on-the-Lake wine, light and delicious, a wrap with egg, asparagus, tomatoes and cheese, with a perfect mixed green salad. Good bread. Great company with lots of time for catching up, and followed by a shared pane cotta with berries and tea. Vicki has put aside her doula work since William arrived; like me, Vicki is not sure how long this little one will live within such close proximity and isn't willing to give up any of it. I know exactly how she feels. </p>
<p>We did a little shopping together, stopping at a health food store and then at a drug store for only-in-Canada supplies for me. I caught the subway home in time to meet Kelly at the school, where she was meeting Myk' and Bry'. Hans Feldmann Sr. was there too, to meet Caillie. It was so nice to see him; he looks great and they have plans to go to Listowel tomorrow with the children and Hans, for a tractor event, I believe. No doubt Mark will be going with them. I didn't see Bryn as he was at a school soccer game at 3:30. </p>
<p>I asked Bry' to come upstairs with me, and when I showed him his room I got a very enthusiastic "Thank you very much!" Bry' really appreciates a clean and tidy room, but especially appreciates someone else helping with it. He has been like this from the time I have known him and his enthusiasm is very sweet. He immediately asked if we could sort out the bins I told him needed doing, and we did so while Kelly prepared their fruit snack. We got through two bins, with lots getting tossed, and most being sorted, and then after his snack he came up again and we went through the other four. It looks great, we had a huge bag of things to get rid of, and now we need Bryn to go through his belongings. Bryn tends to keep more than Bry' does, but I'm sure there will be some things he hasn't used in the past six months and will be willing to toss. </p>
<p>Kelly walked the two children over to their piano lesson at 5 p.m., came home, and we put out the garbage plus a few things from the basement clear-out... a children's wooden school desk, which disappeared within the hour, an old golf bag, and a printer/scanner. Yahoo! We also have a nice stack of things to go to the school for their big sale, so slowly but surely the house is getting decluttered. </p>
<p>We ate some leftover pizza for dinner (things sure are different when Gregg is around!), watched Dr. Phil, and the first day of the 20th season of Oprah. I was ready to just put my feet up, and enjoyed both shows, but then dashed down to do another couple of loads of laundry. How it piles up around this house with four active children! </p>
<p>I phoned Riku a little earlier tonight, hoping to catch him before his tubtime. Instead, he was eating dinner... spinach ravioli. He sounded much better tonight; he told me he played with blocks and trains at school. We had quite a little songfest session, starting with me singing the alphabet to him (he asked for it by name!), and then we went on to some familiar nursery rhymes... Jack and Jill (he told me that Jack did not climb up the hill!... and then giggled when I insisted he had), Humpty Dumpty, Little Miss Muffet.. and another set of giggles when I said he frightened Miss Muffet away. We sang "Down at the Station" together, with Riku doing Grandpa's "all aboard!" at the end, and then I suggested we hang up so he could finish his dinner. He said "nice talking to you" and we finished off with our usual "goodnight sweetheart" and "talk to you soon." </p>
<p>I wanted to talk with Amelia and hoped I wasn't calling too late for her at 7:15 their time. I was lucky, as her day was running later than usual, and she and Kevin were still at the playground. It gave me a chance to talk with Susan and catch up with her a bit. Amelia came in but didn't feel like talking; she was ready for some TV time, despite it really being her dinner and bath time. Her mom held steady and I could hear Amelia in the background chatting away about her shoes. I asked her where her shoes were when she came to the phone and she said "right here"! She did say goodnight to me, kissed the phone, and went off being her busy self. Can't wait to see her again and then went right to the darling photos Doug took of her on her napping on Friday on their walk together.  </p>
<p>Kelly had a three-and-a-half-hour new consultant orientation meeting here, and is just now finishing up. I'm going to join her, fold the next load of laundry, and relax with her. It's 10:30 already, and I'm sure Kelly will want to get to sleep at a decent hour tonight. Tomorrow we plan to do a major sorting/cleaning in her CM room downstairs. Night night...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/tuesday_fall_cleaning.html">Tuesday...  Fall Cleaning</a></h2>
								<p>Today Kelly and I had grand plans to get lots done in the house; we had no children here for lunch, and a full day to work on the basement and the third floor hallway. Alas, we got lots done, but not all that we planned to do. </p>
<p>Kelly had CM work to do on the computer, and so I decided to work on the main floor window cleaning. I started with the sliding patio doors in the kitchen, and Candy called when I had almost finished these. It was a big job, with the tracks needing a major cleaning and Kelly's help was necessary for moving the large glass doors off the frame. I continued on with the front door windows, and had worked my way into the dining room by the time we hung up the phone, an hour and a half later. I was such an inspiration to Candy that she decided to get her window cleaning done too. </p>
<p>Kelly gots lots of office work done while this was going on, and we took a break for a late lunch, watching a little TV while eating. Then, finally, it was time to get at the basement. I vacuumed the storage room while Kelly did the sorting/tossing; I continued on with the laundry in between dashing upstairs with various items for the school, the garbage, and free takeaways at the front curb. Of course we were under full sail when it was time to pick up Myk' and Bry' from school. We really need one full afternoon back at this. Hope it happens. </p>
<p>Kelly made up the usual fruit/snack tray, Bry' went out with Manitou for some ball throwing/catching, Kelly walked them over for their piano lessons, and Alex picked them up for the night with him. </p>
<p>It was sadly obvious that Gregg wasn't home, as we sat down in front of the TV and ate heated up leftover delivered pizza; it was good but not quite up to the usual food standards in this house. Ah, how spoiled I have become! </p>
<p>Right after dinner I made Caillie's chocolate cake for tomorrow's celebration; I shall do the whipping cream filling and icing tomorrow. </p>
<p>Kelly had a three-plus-hour training session with a consultant, so I sat upstairs watching a couple of shows, spent the rest of the time writing emails, and going up and down to the final loads of laundry.</p>
<p>Both of us went up to bed just after 11 p.m. Kelly was tired from three hours of talking/explaining, and I was tired from another busy but productive day.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/sunshine_humidity_lightning_an.html">Sunshine, Humidity, Lightning, and Rain</a></h2>
								<p>Busy morning, busy afternoon, and an evening out. Kelly drove to school at 8:30 with Manitou, picking up another dog there, and driving to Don Valley for a three mile run with them both. </p>
<p>I decided to get the birthday gifts wrapped for both Kelly and Bryn, which meant getting into my huge suitcase and sorting through it. It took longer than I thought, and then I got to work on the first of the two living room windows; getting the screen back in was a challenge, but with Kelly's help we did it. One more to do, but it will wait until tomorrow. </p>
<p>Only Caillie and Bryn were home for lunch today; Myk' and Bry' had theirs at school. I had the second half of the roti Mark had picked up for me on Tuesday, and then we drove Caillie to school (Bryn had left earlier on his own to play with friends), continuing on to return three of Caillie's birthday gifts (too small!) and do our Costco shopping as well. It was lots of fun; we were efficient as we had only two and a half hours in total. I found a pair of pants for Bryn's birthday and restocked them on pistachio nuts since everyone loves them. </p>
<p>Arrived back home at 2:50, unpacked the van, got most of the groceries away, changed clothes, and dashed off to the subway at 3:25 to catch the 4:10 Go train to Oakville. Carol picked me up at 4:40. It had been sunny and humid during the day, then threatened rain, but looked as though it might blow over. Kelly suggested that I take a rain jacket along with me, but it was so hot that I couldn't imagine needing it. I did carry an umbrella though. </p>
<p>Good thing, as it started to rain as Carol and I walked to a new-to-us restaurant in Oakville called "Paradiso". It was great and we will go there again for sure; it wasn't too crowded and so we were able to sit for four-plus hours visiting and eating. We shared the lightest gnocchi I think I have ever had, with a very good tomato sauce, and shared Carol's dish of phyllo pastry layered with eggplant, zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta cheese, with a tomato sauce as well. We went through two baskets of their very good bread, with oil and vinegar, shared a delicious pumpkin cheesecake, and sat over tea and coffee until it was time to leave for my 9:30 train back to Toronto. Carol had photos of her two grandchildren with her, and we caught up with what has been going on in our lives. She has had two deaths in the family in a month, and life is very busy for her right now. I had a window view and quite enjoyed the sheet lightning flashing across the sky for three hours. </p>
<p>It did pour hard on our way to the car, but it was dry in Toronto, thank goodness, as I walked home at 10:45 p.m. Gregg was already in bed, and Kelly washing when I walked in. </p>
<p>Bryn had sent through a URL for the photo albums he has been working on, but unfortunately I couldn't access them through the computer downstairs. That, and a phone call to Riku, will have to wait until tomorrow. Bed at midnight...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/one_week_more_in_ontario.html">One Week More in Ontario!</a></h2>
								<p>... and how this five weeks has flown by! I can hardly believe that I will be back in San Francisco a week from now; there is still so much to do here, and I haven't visited with everyone I would like to... and perhaps won't, at this late date. I am off to the Falls on Sunday, returning here on Wednesday morning, and two days later I will be on the plane west. </p>
<p>Caillie and I sleep well together; she snuggles up and curls up against me, just as the night gets cooler, making it ever so easy to slip back into sleep when I awaken around 6:30 a.m. Today however, Caillie woke a little earlier than usual, around 7:10, and we talked softly, about the sound machine I brought for her from home, while I rubbed her back and spent that quiet time together. This is a busy household and our time alone together is limited. </p>
<p>This morning she was up and dressed in her new navy blue skirt, blue tights, neat black buckled shoes (no runners today!) and a cute striped top. I couldn't resist getting a photo of her outside, waiting for her Mom to walk her to school. This is rare too, as mornings are harder for Caillie than the other children, and there is always a last-minute change of socks, or slacks, or top, causing a dash out the door. </p>
<p>Bryn, Bry' and Myk' all went off together earlier, so Gregg and Kelly, with Manitou, walked Caillie to school and came home with a Starbucks hot chocolate for me... a lovely treat. At home I have a big mug of hot chocolate every day but here have had it only twice in four weeks. </p>
<p>Once again, our plan was to get to work on more fall cleaning/sorting, but Kelly had a photo to work on and order, a business call, and some computer business to do first. I washed the second windown in the living room, and two blinds, answered a couple of emails and chatted with Glenna, who called late in the morning. She is on her way to South America tomorrow for a week and then Bermuda, but has just had her baby granddaughter and daughter-in-law visiting with them for a week. Jasmine looks just like her dad (Sharif) at the same age. Can't wait to get to Montreal for a visit to Glenna's new home on Nun's Island; she moved in a year ago! One day... </p>
<p>All the children took their lunches to school today; I had leftover butternut squash risotto, which I missed out on last night (it's one of Kelly's specialties and Caillie, Myk' and Bry' are very fond of it too), and Gregg made grilled ham and cheese for Kelly and himself. </p>
<p>Finally, at almost 2 p.m. we got upstairs to the third floor landing sorting... books, books, and more books, and some games. Kelly gathered together two large stacks of books for the school library/classrooms, and a bushel basket filled with games and assorted oddments, while I tidied and cleared out most of Caillie's room. </p>
<p>Kelly and I drove the goodies to school, gave Bry' his sleeping bag and pillow for his sleepover at a friend's house, went to Rogers video store for movies for Caillie and Myk' tonight, one for the adults which we will watch at some point this weekend, and dropped off Caillie at the hairdresser's to get two bright red strands of red "hair" added to the four blue streaks already there. They are not permanent colouring of her own hair, but woven into her lovely blond hair. Myk' went with her and they walked home together soon after that was done. </p>
<p>I had needed Kelly's help with some of the sorting in Caillie's room,  but unfortunately did not get the garbage bag tossed out before she came home. Caillie was quite upset that Kelly was actually throwing out two broken tambourines!, and the odd bits of paper and plastic bits and feathers that I had gathered up. Egad! The child is a hoarder for sure; it is so difficult for her to get rid of anything at all. We should know better; even books she hasn't read in years become immediately important to her. </p>
<p>It's Friday night, and two of the four children were going to be home tonight, but Gregg had decided not to make his homemade pizza for dinner. I was so disappointed, as I haven't been here for it yet this trip. Apparently Kelly told him this, and the next thing I knew they were out the door to buy pizza dough and portobello mushrooms. How wonderful! I did a little more clearing out in Caillie's room, sat down to answer a couple of emails upstairs, but was soon drawn down to the delicious smell of the pizza cooking. Mine was superb... roasted red pepper, mushrooms, and eggplant, fresh basil and other herbs from the garden, Kelly's homemade tomato sauce, spinach, broccoli, and feta cheese. Oh my, it was soooo good, and I ended up eating what should have been enough for two meals in all for me. He made the girls plain cheese, and he and Kelly added chicken to theirs. We all watched some of "Mean Girls" with the two girls and at 9 p.m. they went up for a sleepover in Myk's bedroom. I shall have Caillie's room to myself tonight. </p>
<p>I phoned Riku at 7:30 his time, and he has such a cold; he sounded so stuffy and had no energy but was happy to have his Auntie Kelly sing "Baby Beluga" to him, and I sang a little to him as well. Poor wee tyke; it was hard to listen to his stuffy little nose and low voice. Doug picked him up from school today and I hope he had a nice long nap in the car before they went on their exploration walk in Golden Gate Park; the photos he sent were lovely, if not his usual smiley self. </p>
<p>I'm off to bed; it's midnight and tomorrow we are going to celebrate Bryn's birthday, three days early. That means a coconut cloud cake is in the works for tomorrow...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/celebrating_bryns_11th_birthda.html">Celebrating Bryn's 11th Birthday!</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke at 8:10 this morning; it was still quiet in Mykayla's room across the hall, and hard to believe that both girls were still sleeping. Kelly was up and out the door at 9:15 for her meeting; Caillie woke up just in time to say goodbye to her. </p>
<p>Gregg went off walking, to pick up the boys from their two sleepovers, and the girls and I watched a fun little rental movie called "I'll be There", set in Scotland. The boys came in about two-thirds of the way through it and watched the rest with us. My guess is there will be a second viewing of it tomorrow morning. </p>
<p>Gregg, Manitou, and the four children left at noon to walk to Sandy's to pick up some camping gear for next weekend -- that trip to the Grand Canyon is coming up fast for them! -- and to have some playtime in the park with Manitou. On the way home, they stopped for gifts for Bryn, and groceries for his taco birthday dinner tonight. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, I made Bryn's favourite coconut cloud cake, and a pan of date squares as well. Started the laundry too; it sure adds up in this household, and there are four loads to be done. I heated up the last of my pizza for a late brunch and when Gregg came in he made grilled cheese sandwiches and heated up the risotto for Caillie and Bry'. Bryn and I finally had a chance to go through his miscellaneous basket and Bry' worked on sorting through one of the three stacking bins, throwing out lots of plastic toys, and giving me some items for Riku. I might have trouble getting all of this home, as Kelly has given me books and puzzles for the children in SF. </p>
<p>All of the children practiced the piano, and then Caillie went out on her skidboard, Bry' on his skateboard and Bryn on his scooter. Later on, Caillie put on roller blades and I took a couple of photos of her and Bry' outside on this beautiful day. </p>
<p>Kelly went birthday shopping after her meeting, came home and wrapped the gifts, and was already tired, as were the boys, by the time we sat down for dinner. </p>
<p>Myk' and I started in on her room, first picking everything up off the floor, and then changing her books and papers from one place to the other. She was great and got rid of lots of "stuff" she hasn't used in ages, and won't. A lot of books went in the hallway for Kelly to sort through as well. We did so much and it was really looking pretty good when we had to stop for dinner.</p>
<p>Dinner was served at 6:40; it was delicious as always, with fresh tomatoes from the garden, ground beef, refried beans, sour cream, guacamole made by Kelly, grated cheddar, lots of shredded lettuce, grilled eggplant and red peppers cut in slivers, and both whole wheat soft tortillas and hard shells too. </p>
<p>Caillie surprised me by eating four burritos, all with whole wheat tortillas, and the last two with just beans and a little cheese. How wonderful to see her eating beans; SF and the Roosevelt Tamale Parlour were good for her over the past couple of visits! </p>
<p>Bryn got up and started clearing the table in anticipation of his cake and gifts. They had all (but Caillie) licked the beaters and/or bowls while I was baking and the boys shared in the angel food cake bits leftover from the final decorating. Myk', Caillie, and Gregg do not like coconut, and that is fine with Kelly as she is happy to eat as much of this cake as there is... Bryn too. </p>
<p>Bryn opened lots of great gifts..,  from Kelly and Gregg he had already received tickets to see the "Green Day" last month, his current favourite band, and also a Creative Memories bag, album, and some supplies early as well. He also received from them today... a "Simple Plan" CD, skateboard figurines, a bag of Ghiardelli chocolate mints, a Lego "Night Racer", a Bionicle set, a great noise making tube, soft black jeans, and the "Batman Legacy", a set of three DVDs. I think the gift that he must loved though was a hard cover version of a book in the series he is enjoying so much right now... "Freeglader" in the Edge Chronicles. His eyes opened wide and he told Kelly he loved her when he opened it. He wasn't expecting to read it until it came out in soft cover, and it was obvious that he was just delighted with this gift. </p>
<p>The children bought him a B-Damon combat game, which he had asked for. He had played it at the CNE and it caught his attention, so this gift was also very well received. </p>
<p>We bought him a couple of books... "A Perfect Friend" by Reynolds Price, one of my own favourite authors, and "Tricks with Your Head", by a magician we saw in Las Vegas and whom they may see as well while there, a card game called Quiddler, some note cards (as he had told me he was all out of them), a pair of cotton pants and two long-sleeved t-shirts, a Green Day CD, and one by a band I heard one day on NPR cakked "Fountains of Way." Auntie Susan and Kevin bought him a pack of CM stickers for his album, Auntie Candy and Uncle Rick sent money in his card, and his Auntie Gail and Uncle Tom bought him another subscription to a magazine he really enjoys.</p>
<p>Bryn was so funny as he opened his gifts... when he read the cards he would comment that there was a secret code on the bottom consisting of various numbers and configurations of Xs and Os! He posed with his mouth open in surprise so we could take photos, and generally hammed it up for us all. </p>
<p>The boys were particularly tired, as they had not slept well at their sleepovers (I wonder why they call them that!) and the girls were ready for bed too, as soon as the last gift was opened and admired. </p>
<p>The grown-ups were pretty flaked out too; I did up the dinner dishes and cleaned the kitchen, put another load of wash in, folded a load while watching a little TV and drinking my first cup of tea of the day... but it was late enough that I started nodding off on the sofa. </p>
<p>Kelly kicked me off and sent me upstairs for bed, and here I sit... prepared to get ready right now... but I may call and see if Riku is at home. It's 10:45 and I'm heading up soon to finish off "The Liar's Club"... really enjoying it.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/toronto_to_niagara_falls_1.html">Toronto to Niagara Falls</a></h2>
								<p>Ah, another busy Sunday at 53 Aldwych Avenue. Caillie and I both awoke at 9 a.m. and lay in bed for another half hour chatting while I drew pictures on her back. We used to read in bed, but this trip Caillie has preferred our new little routine. </p>
<p>Kelly went off for a short run, the children all ate breakfast, I started the laundry immediately, and then went up to Myk's room with her for further sorting/clearing/organizing. This morning we started with her under-the-bed stash, and there was lots to do! However, working together, we did a great job and even had enough time to start on her desktop and drawers. We ran out of time before we had quite finished, but Myk' told me she would work on it on her own and finish up. Still to do... the shelves on her bed and the top of it as well. However, we filled three containers with paper and giveaways so were both very happy with it. </p>
<p>Piano, homework, and Manitou time filled up the rest of the morning, and at noon the six of them set off with some backpacks, somewhat loaded with water and clothing, to "hike" in preparation for the Grand Canyon. They took the subway to an outdoor store first for new backpacks for the girls; the rest are using borrowed packs. </p>
<p>I made up a long list of chores I hoped to get done in the four hours I had on my own. Before starting I had my breakfast, continued on with the laundry, and cleaned the dining room. We hadn't tidied up after Bryn's party last night, so the games, books, music, etc. were still on the table with Lego parts and skateboard figurines, as well as Caillie and Myk's Japanese "babies", which were put on pause while they were out. I dusted and swept and left that room, checking it off the list. </p>
<p>I continued with the laundry and in between sorted out my bags so that Caillie's little room wasn't quite so overwhelmed with all that I've been collecting for the trip home. It was hot and humid, and I left showering until the last hour. I puttered around, putting things away, and it hardly seemed possible that four hours passed before Kelly and crew arrived home. They hadn't finished their anticipated long walk as they were running out of time. There was still piano for a couple of the children, homework, and rollerblades to find as part of Caillie's birthday gift from last week. She and Kelly dashed off to Zeller's, with no luck, but that excursion took far longer than Kelly had expected... and still no rollerblades. </p>
<p>She and I left the house at 5:20, leaving Caillie zipping along the sidewalk using Bry's blades. Caillie loves this activity and seems to have a knack for it too. A quick goodbye to Kelly, dashed in and bought my ticket, and made the bus just in time... left at 5:45 and arrived in the Falls, with two stops, at 7:40, a longer trip than usual. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank pulled up just a minute after I arrived, and we drove right home. We were both a little hungry, so I made a mushroom, spinach, and cheese omelette, which UF pronounced the best mushroom omelette he had ever eaten. Ah, how appreciative he is of a home-cooked meal, even a very simple one. He had picked up some of the whole wheat Italian bread that Marie had told me about, and it was delicious. We had sliced local tomatoes with it, not nearly as tasty as Kelly's and Gregg's; I am going to miss those fresh-from-the-garden tomatoes! </p>
<p>We took our tea downstairs, chatting about what UF hopes to get done in the two days I am here... delivering and/or mailing the photos he now has in heavy ziplock bags, sorting through the vast collection of cds and keeping only his favourites, making an appointment to see a doctor in St. Catherines he saw years ago, but this time for his hip/leg problem, and doing a good sort on the birthday/anniversary cards they had bought over the years. </p>
<p>I have my own personal list too... washing the kitchen and bathroom floors on hands and knees, to get into the corners, and doing the ironing so that is out of UF's way. Most of these shirts are short-sleeved and a mixed blend so need only a touch-up.</p>
<p>I called SF to speak to Riku, and found Akane at her studio. We chatted for a bit; she and Riku stood at the bus stop for eighty-five minutes(!) last night after the movie. Riku fell asleep while waiting, and then had to be wakened to get on and off the bus. </p>
<p>Akane had him at the doctor on Friday and was told he has the flu; he suggested a flu shot for both Riku and Akane, and Riku is now on over-the-counter medication. </p>
<p>I called Hampshire Street and talked to Riku, who sounded so unlike himself. He was coughing quite heavily, Bryn told me his nose is running so much, and he didn't even want to hear one song; this was a first, so I know how tough he was feeling. Bryn said he was just getting ready to tuck him into bed. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank and I had a glass of delicious red wine to finish off a bottle UF had bought this week, and went through a couple of dozen CDs. He is saving lots of classical music, a few favourite current ones, and one lot he calls his "special" collection of medieval music, and some ancient monastic tunes. He thought we weren't doing well with this job, as he seemed to be keeping a lot, but in actual fact he did very well, keeping just a bit over half of them. Some will go back to those who bought them and the rest will be taken to the CD store to be sold. This is another project, and we may have to get started at it earlier tonight in order to finish it up. </p>
<p>Bed at 1 a.m. Uncle Frank has six lovely orange blooms in my room, had the towels laid out on the bed, as I once told him Susan does for guests, and a lovely poem he had printed out for his guests to make themselves at home. I have; it's lovely to be back with Uncle Frank and I know the next two days are going to go by much too quickly.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/monday_with_uncle_frank.html">Monday with Uncle Frank</a></h2>
								<p>Shall do a quick review of my day with Uncle Frank in Niagara Falls... we got so much done and there is still lots to do. Lovely that we have fun and get to spend time together while we do it all! </p>
<p>I awoke at 8 a.m., showered, dressed, and puttered around a bit, reading the paper, and sorting out some old black and white negatives. After I finished some of that, and since UF was still sleeping, I decided I would get started on the long row of shirts in the laundry room waiting to be ironed. </p>
<p>The laundry room looked amazing when I walked in last night; UF has spent hours clearing and sorting down there, and then had John paint the floor a warm golden colour. It is shiny and brightens up the space so much; UF also drilled holes in the wall and hung up brooms and mops but mostly he just got rid of so much "clutter". He is really on a roll, and fall cleaning is well underway here. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank slept until 11 a.m.! .. shocked that he had slept so late, but also said he was in a deep and wonderful sleep and felt great. I had just finished the 26 shirts and had put aside two needing buttons, when he came down for his shower. </p>
<p>Brunch at noon... scrambled eggs (as per UF's request), two slices of my "bacon" which he really liked, toasted whole wheat Italian bread (yum!), and stewed tomatoes... and of course our hot cuppa following breakfast. We sat and chatted and went to work sorting through yet another box of photos UF had found on his office shelf. What a treasure this was! Auntie Rita had sorted out many of By's photos and memorabilia, and what a lucky boy he is... cards given to him for his second birthday on up through perhaps nine or so, but many of them for each year. There is one from our Nana Lee, and many from his Auntie Betty and Uncle Stew (my Mom and Dad) as well as other relatives and friends. His baby book is there, so we learned that he spoke his first word, "No!", at ten months, and walked around on his first birthday, and that my Mom found his first tooth at four months of age! We spent hours reading the letters from his grandparents in Colorado, and exclaiming over the wonderful black and white photos of him as a little boy. It was hard to pull ourselves away. </p>
<p>I also stripped UF's bed, and he helped me turn it over end for end and top to bottom. All the bedding got washed, including the dust ruffle, and made up for tonight. </p>
<p>UF phoned, at my gentle prodding, for a doctor's appointment. He is hoping to get in to see a specialist about his hip/leg, and so will see his doctor tomorrow! </p>
<p>UF had sorted more photos for the family while I was in Toronto, and so our goal last night was to deliver them all. I had prepared a wee mid-afternoon snack for us of cheese, a pear, and a date square I had made in Toronto, but by the time we left the house we were both ready for dinner. </p>
<p>Our first drop was at Ian's; he may have been at Lisa's but we dropped the photos between his doors and went for dinner at the Italian restaurant we had eaten at with Shel' and Donna; UF thought the stuffed mushrooms sounded like the perfect dinner, and we shared those and a vegetarian quesadilla. UF declared it a perfect dinner and we shall finish off the quesadilla for lunch today. </p>
<p>We were there much later than we had planned, due to a mistake in the order, so we drove first to Lena Sparkman's, an old friend of Auntie Rita's, with a huge stack of photos of her when she was much much younger, many taken with our mom and AR, and many of her children as well. UF sat in the car for this and the other deliveries, as we had many miles to go tonight. Lena was delighted to see me, and told me I looked just like my Mom! It's not often I hear that and I was very happy to hear it from her. We took a little time for her to see some of the photos and I was so happy that we had decided to keep them for her. </p>
<p>From there we drove right to Beth's with her photos; I called Shel' from there. He and Donna were on their way to bed... 10 p.m. by this time, but we managed to get there and hand them over. UF had found an 8x11 photo of Sheldon singing in a Christmas choir when he was about twelve years old; I think it had been published in the Niagara Falls Review then, and Sheldon was delighted to see it. It's lovely of him; he is wearing a plaid coat and looks oh so sweet and sincere, which he was. </p>
<p>From Shel's we drove to Glenn's; he and Shel' had been on the phone when I walked in, so Glenn and Wendy were expecting us. We did go in there, and spent a lovely hour with them and Steph' too. UF sat in a very comfortable chair which "stood" him up, vibrated in various places (he tried them all!) and with heat. It wasn't easy convincing him it was time to leave! </p>
<p>Wendy has so thoughtfully put together a "memory box" for Jan, filled with photos, memorabilia, as well as her eulogy and death notice, beautifully typed up and in a lovely album. What a gift for Glenn and for Becky, although it may be too soon for them to appreciate it. We always have fun there, and enjoy the company so much. </p>
<p>At 11:30 we said goodnight, with hugs and kisses, and came home for our sleepytime tea, and of course a glass of port each. We went to bed at 12:30, a much more reasonable time than usual around here. What a busy and happy day this was together.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/happy_birthday_bryn_1.html">Happy Birthday, Bryn!</a></h2>
								<p>Today is Bryn's 11th birthday, which seems far too close to teenagehood to me! He is over at his Dad's today and will no doubt have had apple pie for his "cake" and dinner with Hans, Caillie, and his Uncle Mark. We celebrated together on Saturday, and I had an ecard for him to receive today. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this morning brought such sad news from Zoë in the U.K. Graham, her beloved partner, died of an apparently unexpected and massive heart attack three days ago. I cannot imagine how devasted Zoë and her children must be, and how unimaginable it is that Graham is no longer with us in the world.</p>
<p>Uncle Frank said tonight that it is easy to get lots done when you have a twenty-hour day, and that was very close to the truth! We started our day off with a simple breakfast of cereal, strawberries, toast, and tea. Uncle Frank had some computer work to do before we started in on what we had agreed was of utmost importance today... the infamous "headbump" space. I made a corn and vegetable chowder, using up the four ears of corn, a green pepper, some new red potatoes, and onions, and left it simmering on the stove while we worked. </p>
<p>The boxes of Christmas decorations were to be tackled and we did it, although it took a couple of hours. There were more than eight large Rubbermaid containers filled to the brim with garlands, linens, decorations, candles, and holders, each carefully labeled with the room they were to go in. Uncle Frank went over each item carefully, weeding out the ones he could live without, although it wasn't an easy job to do. He knows, however, that he will never decorate the house the way that Auntie Rita did. There were two artificial trees, mugs, platters, etc., which Beth said she would take, along with strings of lights as well as much of the above. </p>
<p>We stopped for lunch and had the leftover quesadillas from last night along with the soup. I gathered up all the items needing delivery today and off we went, with tapes, a book, and photos to the Legion, our first stop. One of the women there asked if I were Rita Massard's sister, and that was before she saw Uncle Frank! This happened last year as well, with a different woman. Uncle Frank got a big hug from Helen, one of the women in the office who was very fond of Auntie Rita. </p>
<p>From there we went to the doctor, for a referral to a specialist for Uncle Frank. He is very fond of Dr. Gill, his M.D., and hopes to have an appointment soon to check out once again if there is a possible solution to his leg problem. </p>
<p>We drove all over town after that, it seems... all the way to Stamford Green to drop off several boxes at the Goodwill, to the post office to mail the photos to Gail and Candy (and having to repackage them in order not to have to pay "oversize" rates), and over to Beth's to drop off several containers filled to the brim. </p>
<p>I called Gerry from Beth's (she was at work) to see if they were available for dinner tonight. I could hear a little one fussing in the background, and was delighted to learn that Tanner, Yvette's and Jeff's little sixteen month old, was still there with them. We picked up the fish and chips, Gerry had the table set, tea made, and lemon loaf for dessert. I was so happy to be there catching up on what was new in their lives. Tanner, however, was the main attraction. He is really darling, very affectionate, put his head on my shoulder almost immediately, sat at the table with us eating chick-peas, and pushing all the buttons on his ride-on toy. He was a tired fellow when we finished eating at 6:30, so off we went as we had lots to do at home. </p>
<p>We went right to work; I put UF's summer shirts in one closet and his winter shirts in another, while he went through his winter clothes and did a good toss-out. </p>
<p>Then UF started clearing out his office closet; we took photos out of frames, which went in the "donate" pile, got rid of lots of paper work no longer necessary to keep, put office supplies on the cleared shelves, and as a result found another bin of photos! No time for this bin while I am here this trip, but UF may work his way through them over the next few months.</p>
<p>I called to say goodnight to Riku; he was coughing badly and still sounding pretty under-the-weather. This cold has really been holding on; it must be taking its toll on him. </p>
<p>Can't wait to get home and see both Riku and Amelia. I know they will both have changed too much... all those lost photo ops! </p>
<p>Uncle Frank cleared out a drawer in his room so there was room for his winter sweatshirts; I got those all washed today and freshened up for him. Out with the shorts and on with the warm woolies! </p>
<p>Next, I thought it would be wise to start off with the birthdays UF needed for his online birthday reminder. We started currently, and went forward right through January and onto next fall. It took us over three hours(!) but we finished it, very very late... 1:30 a.m.  And finally it was time to sit down with our port, and do what I have been looking forward to all day... go through the box of Neal's memorabilia I had discovered last night. We said goodnight at 4:30 a.m... and then I sat reading, and went through some more photos; I was pretty wired by that time and finally turned the light out at 5:45... crazy!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/niagara_falls_to_toronto_celeb.html">Niagara Falls to Toronto... Celebrating Kelly's 40th!</a></h2>
								<p>Well, after a very short night, with less than three hours of sleep, I woke at 8 a.m. and started moving! Sheets in the washer, packed my bags, showered, and sat at 10 a.m. for breakfast with Uncle Frank. We had cereal, toast, fruit, and tea; I checked the bus schedule, found out I had an extra fifteen minutes and so had time to sew on the buttons on two shirts I had hoped to do yesterday. </p>
<p>We left at 10:55 for my 11:15 bus. It was hard to say goodbye to Uncle Frank; we have had such a good time together, and make a good team in the house. He can't believe how much we accomplished and neither could I, and we feel very good about all our hard work. Of course the best parts of our days together are our meals and nighttime glass of port, always relaxing and never rushed. </p>
<p>I thought I would sleep on the bus, but after closing my eyes for a bit, I got busy going through a couple of magazines I took with me and finished off my book as well. Nice to have those finished so that I didn't need to pack them back with me. </p>
<p>Kelly was kind enough to pick me up at 1:10; I was so grateful, as my heel is bothering me and the bags are heavy enough that it would have made it even worse. We went to an outdoor store to pick up Bryn's backpack for the trip and I stocked up on Doug's and my favourite coconut chocolate bars. </p>
<p>Kelly has received some lovely birthday cards; it is so nice that they have come in early as she will not be here on the 2nd of October. Gregg's parents' card was especially touching, commenting on how grateful they are to have Kelly in their son's life and their grandchildren's too. </p>
<p>Gregg went off for a few groceries, and as soon as he returned I started on the cake Kelly had decided on for her birthday... a chocolate chip cheesecake. It's a Mrs. Field's recipe, lighter than our usual one, but with the chocolate chips added to it, looked and sounded great. Of course we hadn't counted on the extra time it needed to stay in the oven after it baked, and Gregg had chicken to go in. As a result, dinner wasn't on the table until 7:30, later for the children than was ideal.</p>
<p>Dinner was delicious though, and well worth waiting for. Gregg had breaded and baked chicken with parmesan cheese in the crumbs, added Kelly's tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese to it, and baked it again until it was heated through and the cheese melted. We had some leftover tofu in the fridge to use up, and he used the same technique with it; it was just wonderful. Bryn loved it too, as did Bry'. Yum! I plan to make this at home. Along with it, we had a Caesar salad and gnocchi. </p>
<p>Kelly opened her presents immediately after dinner; we took the usual photos as the cake was brought in and the candles blown out with wishes. Of course Kelly's gift for this special birthday is their upcoming trip to the Grand Canyon, but Gregg and the children had bought her some lottery tickets to try her luck with. Myk's gave her $11 in total which pleased both of them very much. </p>
<p>Doug and I gave her all her wrapped gifts... two pairs of black "West Van" leisure pants, which looked just amazing on her, as I knew they would, a very pretty pink long sleeved top, which looks great with the pants, two children's books ("James and the Giant Peach", and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"), which she wanted for her collection of children's books, a large bottle of "Rescue Remedy" for those nights that she can't get to sleep, a tube of her favourite tanning lotion, a bottle of ice wine to share with Gregg on a night alone with him, and a purple travel kit, a larger one which more suits her needs these days; she and Gregg often share one. </p>
<p>Mark joined us for dinner as well. He gave Kelly $40 worth of gift certificates for Le Commensal, a place we both love to go to. I didn't even get there this trip, or to Marche, another favourite. Life has been far too busy this fall! </p>
<p>We didn't have the cake after all; it was too soft to get out of the pan in one piece, and so they had other treats... coconut cloud cake, and chocolate. Tomorrow at lunch we will have it, and we will put the full 40 candles on it as well. </p>
<p>After the children were tucked it, we realized how tired we all were, and after I wrote a couple of emails, and watched a bit of TV with Kelly and Gregg, we headed up to bed. I didn't read one page in my new book before turning off the light at 11:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Missing Uncle Frank and my glass of port, although we did have some lovely white wine with dinner. I had a lovely email from Uncle Frank, though, filling me in on all of his accomplishments today; he made a stop at the Legion with the scrapbook of photos we found the day before, and the kind people at the Goodwill store unloaded all the items from the back of his car. He also planted the pot of orange mums, which he hopes will last through the winter, did a little weeding, pulled up and cooked rhubarb from the side yard, and even cooked himself a tasty omelette using the green pepper and mushrooms in the fridge. What a guy!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/09/my_last_day_in_toronto.html">My Last Day in Toronto...</a></h2>
								<p>... and it is such a fall day! We woke up to the trees blowing madly, and with a definite nip in the air. Brrr! The children had to wear long pants and long sleeves for the first day, although the sun came up later and warmed them all up, but not the adults. </p>
<p>Kelly went off for her run, after delivering Caillie to school a half hour late. Caillie had "clothing issues" again today, just not able to find the clothes that fit comfortably, and that she was happy with; Kelly is using some Super Nanny techniques and they seem to work very well with Caillie... not that we are surprised at this. When Caillie is tired she has a very low meltdown point, and today was one of those days. Caillie is a child who is in bed at 7 p.m. and almost always asleep at 7:30; even one night of not getting twelve hours of sleep takes a toll on her. The other children stay up an hour later, but they too need early-to-bed routines. </p>
<p>I sat and had a big mug of hot chocolate, such a treat on a colder than usual morning. And then I started cleaning the kitchen; I don't usually go to bed leaving dishes undone, but there were just too many of them to fit in the dishwasher last night and I didn't have the energy to deal with the rest of them. Gregg cooks, for which we two Dyment women are very grateful, and I am more than happy to take responsibility for the aftermath. It was a good day for this, though; I took everything off the counters, washed them all thoroughly once the dishes were done, wiped the cupboard doors, and swept through the dining room.</p>
<p>I had time to read my emails, answer a few quick ones from Uncle Frank, and then it was time to get lunch ready. Mark had kindly picked up another roti for me, and I had half for my lunch, while the others had mac' and cheese. All four children were home today. Of course we had the cheesecake, now just perfectly chilled and very very tasty! I had walked out for the candles, Kelly got to make another wish, and it was a fun last lunch with all of the children. Myk' and Bry' are with their mom for dinner tonight. </p>
<p>I spent the best part of the afternoon packing my two bags, plus a very full carry-on and another "purse". I may have to leave a few things behind, as I have so many books for the children to take home, some puzzles, food, cheese, fruit bars, clothes for Amelia from Kelly, etc. etc. that it was a real challenge. I just hope that neither of the check-in bags weighs more than 70 pounds! There are no scales here to check this with and I may have to do some switching around at the airport. I'm not looking forward to my four-hour wait in Chicago with a too-heavy carry on. </p>
<p>At 4 o'clock Kelly drove me to the school to watch Myk's soccer game. Bryn had come home an hour early today, as he hadn't felt well, and Bryant and Caillie were there to see the game as well. It was bloody cold standing around the field, even with the blanket I had taken along with me to sit on, wrapped around me instead! Gregg joined me for the second half of the game, Caillie and Bryant kept warm on their scooters, and Myk' was fine too, running up and down the field during the first half of the game. They lost 5-0 and home we came. </p>
<p>Our plan had been to have dinner out at a Japanese restaurant Bryn and Caillie are very fond of; Bryn so wants me to try his favourite egg dish there, and a tofu entree as well, but of course since he left school early, Kelly decided not to set a precedent where a child could miss school and then carry on as usual. It was too bad, but understandable; we will have our dinner out at Christmas instead, and tonight we can use up all our leftovers. </p>
<p>Dinner was delicious; I had the gnochhi with a mushroom, a whole tomato, some shredded "chicken" and a little spinach added to it, along with toasted baguette. The children had some toast too, after they finished their chicken, salad and corn dinner. Meant to have a slice of cheesecake too, but I forgot about it! </p>
<p>I watched the newest CM training video whilst doing three more pieces of mending, and running up and down doing the laundry. At 9 p.m. Kelly and I pulled out the winter clothing buckets, prepared for the big switch-over, but ran out of time. She and Gregg wanted to watch the first season show of one of their favourite tv series, and so we ended up putting them back again, after sorting out some of Bryn's clothes. Kelly will have the whole Thanksgiving weekend for this job, although she would rather have company while doing it. Ah well... she needed to sit down and take a break at 10 p.m. </p>
<p>I wrote to Uncle Frank, who had written a lovely email to me, answered a couple of others, and did one final run downstairs at 11 p.m. </p>
<p>I've been in bed, but have a few things on my mind that I am afraid I will forget, and no doubt there is some excitement too at the prospect of being home and seeing everyone again. I spoke to Riku tonight and he was still hacking quite badly. Bryn took him to the doctor today, and he was diagnosed with a "small pocket of pneumonia"! Apparently there were three other cases this week at this practice, and tomorrow he will likely be on antibiotics, after the xray results are back. No singing for him tonight; he was watching TV with his dad and no doubt still not feeling his usual self. </p>
<p>Back to bed I go... tomorrow I shall be writing from San Francisco; hard to imagine not being here.</p>
