								<h2>The End of Another Week!</h2>
								<p>Caillie and I both awoke at 7:20 this morning. She asked what time it was, and then told me I had time to "draw" pictures on her back so she could guess what they were. I drew some cupcakes and she guessed "cakes" which was close enough, and then I dropped off back to sleep while drawing eight candles. However, when she came bounding back into bed after dashing downstairs for a minute, and told me her mom had told her we could go back to sleep!, I knew it was time to get up. </p>
<p>I quickly made up some delicious chocolate icing and iced forty-two cupcakes before we left for school at 8:30, all of us walking in a little bit of drizzle. We were expecting a heavy rainfall today, which didn't bode well for Bryn's soccer game tonight. We were back home for only twenty-five minutes; I answered a couple of emails, and then we drove over for Kelly to do call-backs at the school. That finished at 10 a.m., we delivered 33 cupcakes to Caillie in her classroom. She had a substitute teacher there today, who was very happy to see us on this rainy day recess period. Kelly lit eight candles, we all sang "happy birthday to Caillie, and we gave paper towels to the children, while Caillie took the trays around to each of them, and the teacher too of course. </p>
<p>Caillie also wanted to give them out to her favourite teachers, which meant all of them!, and to the principal, the vice-principal, and her gym teacher. She warned each of them about the hidden "surprise" in the center of them, so no one would swallow a penny. I took a few photos as this may be the last year Caillie feels comfortable doing this. </p>
<p>Kelly had a few CM deliveries to make; we came home and ate, and got busy with our various projects. I called Vicky and made arrangements to see her on Monday at 10:15, I emptied the dishwasher and tidied up a bit. Lounged around for a bit watching Oprah, drinking my tea, walked over with Kelly to pick up Myk' and Bry', gave extra cupcakes to Bryn and Caillie, and dropped them off at Hans'. </p>
<p>Myk' and Bry' left with their mom at 5 p.m. after practicing the piano, and somehow Kelly, Gregg, and I ended up feeling very lazy. I'm sure the heavy rain didn't help our energy level a bit. I ordered a pizza for my dinner, which Gregg and Kelly picked up when they got their chicken souvlaki. </p>
<p>Bryn called while they were gone, which was a lovely surprise, as I haven't heard his voice since arriving home. Of course I heard a couple of cute Riku stories... Riku was eating goldfish crackers and Bryn asked him if he could have the broken one he spotted. Riku agreed to this and Bryn ate it up. Then he spotted a second one, with only a quarter of the little fish cracker in one piece, and asked if he could have it too. Riku's answer: "No, that is Riku's broken cracker."! And the second one... Bryn asked Riku if he could help him build a tower of blocks and Riku replied "No, it is bedtime". Bryn is busy working on putting all of his photos up in a Web site, so just in case he doesn't have time to make a note of these Riku quotes, I have made sure they aren't forgotten! </p>
<p>Vicky had told me this morning that the season's premier SuperNanny was on tonight, so I sat upstairs watching that, and eating three pieces of pizza, while Kelly and Gregg watched their favourite "Big Brother" show, not being happy with the result of the ending. </p>
<p>I called Susan to suggest that she tape it, but they don't get it so I am hoping that Doug did so. It was worth seeing twins refusing to go to sleep! and how the problem was solved. The bonus of the call though, was that I got to say "hello" to Amelia, and have a little chat with her. She was asking "watch TV?" which I was doing and which I believe she was hoping to talk her mommy into letting her do as well. I had an "I love you" from her and a sweet "night night". Home in two weeks today... seems a long time in so many ways...  </p>
<p>And we ended the night watching a taped show that Sherri and Carl had given them, a sweet Italian film called "For Roseanna" or something close to that. I, of course, curled up in the corner of their very comfortable leather sofa, with a full tummy, and nice and warm, nodded off here and there, so I plan to take it home with me so that Doug can see it; perhaps I will nod off in different places with the second viewing! </p>
<p>And our plans for tomorrow have completely changed, due to the rain. Caillie's party for her friends was to have been at Hans' house, with Kelly in charge of the cake, loot bags, and games. Because of Bryn's game being cancelled tonight, he is now playing three games tomorrow, at 10 a.m., 1 p.m., and 5 p.m., the latter being in the middle of Caillie's party. So, Hans will take Bryn to his last game, and the party will be here instead. This is so much more convenient as we won't have to take everything over to Hans' place, awkward with the cupcakes and party favours and all the snacks, etc. So we're happy about the change, although disappointed that we won't see Bryn's last game of the season. However, tomorrow may bring yet more changes so we shall see how it all turns out. </p>
<p>Bedtime at 11:45 p.m.</p>
