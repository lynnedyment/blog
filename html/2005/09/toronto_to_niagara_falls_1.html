								<h2>Toronto to Niagara Falls</h2>
								<p>Ah, another busy Sunday at 53 Aldwych Avenue. Caillie and I both awoke at 9 a.m. and lay in bed for another half hour chatting while I drew pictures on her back. We used to read in bed, but this trip Caillie has preferred our new little routine. </p>
<p>Kelly went off for a short run, the children all ate breakfast, I started the laundry immediately, and then went up to Myk's room with her for further sorting/clearing/organizing. This morning we started with her under-the-bed stash, and there was lots to do! However, working together, we did a great job and even had enough time to start on her desktop and drawers. We ran out of time before we had quite finished, but Myk' told me she would work on it on her own and finish up. Still to do... the shelves on her bed and the top of it as well. However, we filled three containers with paper and giveaways so were both very happy with it. </p>
<p>Piano, homework, and Manitou time filled up the rest of the morning, and at noon the six of them set off with some backpacks, somewhat loaded with water and clothing, to "hike" in preparation for the Grand Canyon. They took the subway to an outdoor store first for new backpacks for the girls; the rest are using borrowed packs. </p>
<p>I made up a long list of chores I hoped to get done in the four hours I had on my own. Before starting I had my breakfast, continued on with the laundry, and cleaned the dining room. We hadn't tidied up after Bryn's party last night, so the games, books, music, etc. were still on the table with Lego parts and skateboard figurines, as well as Caillie and Myk's Japanese "babies", which were put on pause while they were out. I dusted and swept and left that room, checking it off the list. </p>
<p>I continued with the laundry and in between sorted out my bags so that Caillie's little room wasn't quite so overwhelmed with all that I've been collecting for the trip home. It was hot and humid, and I left showering until the last hour. I puttered around, putting things away, and it hardly seemed possible that four hours passed before Kelly and crew arrived home. They hadn't finished their anticipated long walk as they were running out of time. There was still piano for a couple of the children, homework, and rollerblades to find as part of Caillie's birthday gift from last week. She and Kelly dashed off to Zeller's, with no luck, but that excursion took far longer than Kelly had expected... and still no rollerblades. </p>
<p>She and I left the house at 5:20, leaving Caillie zipping along the sidewalk using Bry's blades. Caillie loves this activity and seems to have a knack for it too. A quick goodbye to Kelly, dashed in and bought my ticket, and made the bus just in time... left at 5:45 and arrived in the Falls, with two stops, at 7:40, a longer trip than usual. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank pulled up just a minute after I arrived, and we drove right home. We were both a little hungry, so I made a mushroom, spinach, and cheese omelette, which UF pronounced the best mushroom omelette he had ever eaten. Ah, how appreciative he is of a home-cooked meal, even a very simple one. He had picked up some of the whole wheat Italian bread that Marie had told me about, and it was delicious. We had sliced local tomatoes with it, not nearly as tasty as Kelly's and Gregg's; I am going to miss those fresh-from-the-garden tomatoes! </p>
<p>We took our tea downstairs, chatting about what UF hopes to get done in the two days I am here... delivering and/or mailing the photos he now has in heavy ziplock bags, sorting through the vast collection of cds and keeping only his favourites, making an appointment to see a doctor in St. Catherines he saw years ago, but this time for his hip/leg problem, and doing a good sort on the birthday/anniversary cards they had bought over the years. </p>
<p>I have my own personal list too... washing the kitchen and bathroom floors on hands and knees, to get into the corners, and doing the ironing so that is out of UF's way. Most of these shirts are short-sleeved and a mixed blend so need only a touch-up.</p>
<p>I called SF to speak to Riku, and found Akane at her studio. We chatted for a bit; she and Riku stood at the bus stop for eighty-five minutes(!) last night after the movie. Riku fell asleep while waiting, and then had to be wakened to get on and off the bus. </p>
<p>Akane had him at the doctor on Friday and was told he has the flu; he suggested a flu shot for both Riku and Akane, and Riku is now on over-the-counter medication. </p>
<p>I called Hampshire Street and talked to Riku, who sounded so unlike himself. He was coughing quite heavily, Bryn told me his nose is running so much, and he didn't even want to hear one song; this was a first, so I know how tough he was feeling. Bryn said he was just getting ready to tuck him into bed. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank and I had a glass of delicious red wine to finish off a bottle UF had bought this week, and went through a couple of dozen CDs. He is saving lots of classical music, a few favourite current ones, and one lot he calls his "special" collection of medieval music, and some ancient monastic tunes. He thought we weren't doing well with this job, as he seemed to be keeping a lot, but in actual fact he did very well, keeping just a bit over half of them. Some will go back to those who bought them and the rest will be taken to the CD store to be sold. This is another project, and we may have to get started at it earlier tonight in order to finish it up. </p>
<p>Bed at 1 a.m. Uncle Frank has six lovely orange blooms in my room, had the towels laid out on the bed, as I once told him Susan does for guests, and a lovely poem he had printed out for his guests to make themselves at home. I have; it's lovely to be back with Uncle Frank and I know the next two days are going to go by much too quickly.</p>
