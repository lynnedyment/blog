								<h2>Celebrating Bryn's 11th Birthday!</h2>
								<p>I awoke at 8:10 this morning; it was still quiet in Mykayla's room across the hall, and hard to believe that both girls were still sleeping. Kelly was up and out the door at 9:15 for her meeting; Caillie woke up just in time to say goodbye to her. </p>
<p>Gregg went off walking, to pick up the boys from their two sleepovers, and the girls and I watched a fun little rental movie called "I'll be There", set in Scotland. The boys came in about two-thirds of the way through it and watched the rest with us. My guess is there will be a second viewing of it tomorrow morning. </p>
<p>Gregg, Manitou, and the four children left at noon to walk to Sandy's to pick up some camping gear for next weekend -- that trip to the Grand Canyon is coming up fast for them! -- and to have some playtime in the park with Manitou. On the way home, they stopped for gifts for Bryn, and groceries for his taco birthday dinner tonight. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, I made Bryn's favourite coconut cloud cake, and a pan of date squares as well. Started the laundry too; it sure adds up in this household, and there are four loads to be done. I heated up the last of my pizza for a late brunch and when Gregg came in he made grilled cheese sandwiches and heated up the risotto for Caillie and Bry'. Bryn and I finally had a chance to go through his miscellaneous basket and Bry' worked on sorting through one of the three stacking bins, throwing out lots of plastic toys, and giving me some items for Riku. I might have trouble getting all of this home, as Kelly has given me books and puzzles for the children in SF. </p>
<p>All of the children practiced the piano, and then Caillie went out on her skidboard, Bry' on his skateboard and Bryn on his scooter. Later on, Caillie put on roller blades and I took a couple of photos of her and Bry' outside on this beautiful day. </p>
<p>Kelly went birthday shopping after her meeting, came home and wrapped the gifts, and was already tired, as were the boys, by the time we sat down for dinner. </p>
<p>Myk' and I started in on her room, first picking everything up off the floor, and then changing her books and papers from one place to the other. She was great and got rid of lots of "stuff" she hasn't used in ages, and won't. A lot of books went in the hallway for Kelly to sort through as well. We did so much and it was really looking pretty good when we had to stop for dinner.</p>
<p>Dinner was served at 6:40; it was delicious as always, with fresh tomatoes from the garden, ground beef, refried beans, sour cream, guacamole made by Kelly, grated cheddar, lots of shredded lettuce, grilled eggplant and red peppers cut in slivers, and both whole wheat soft tortillas and hard shells too. </p>
<p>Caillie surprised me by eating four burritos, all with whole wheat tortillas, and the last two with just beans and a little cheese. How wonderful to see her eating beans; SF and the Roosevelt Tamale Parlour were good for her over the past couple of visits! </p>
<p>Bryn got up and started clearing the table in anticipation of his cake and gifts. They had all (but Caillie) licked the beaters and/or bowls while I was baking and the boys shared in the angel food cake bits leftover from the final decorating. Myk', Caillie, and Gregg do not like coconut, and that is fine with Kelly as she is happy to eat as much of this cake as there is... Bryn too. </p>
<p>Bryn opened lots of great gifts..,  from Kelly and Gregg he had already received tickets to see the "Green Day" last month, his current favourite band, and also a Creative Memories bag, album, and some supplies early as well. He also received from them today... a "Simple Plan" CD, skateboard figurines, a bag of Ghiardelli chocolate mints, a Lego "Night Racer", a Bionicle set, a great noise making tube, soft black jeans, and the "Batman Legacy", a set of three DVDs. I think the gift that he must loved though was a hard cover version of a book in the series he is enjoying so much right now... "Freeglader" in the Edge Chronicles. His eyes opened wide and he told Kelly he loved her when he opened it. He wasn't expecting to read it until it came out in soft cover, and it was obvious that he was just delighted with this gift. </p>
<p>The children bought him a B-Damon combat game, which he had asked for. He had played it at the CNE and it caught his attention, so this gift was also very well received. </p>
<p>We bought him a couple of books... "A Perfect Friend" by Reynolds Price, one of my own favourite authors, and "Tricks with Your Head", by a magician we saw in Las Vegas and whom they may see as well while there, a card game called Quiddler, some note cards (as he had told me he was all out of them), a pair of cotton pants and two long-sleeved t-shirts, a Green Day CD, and one by a band I heard one day on NPR cakked "Fountains of Way." Auntie Susan and Kevin bought him a pack of CM stickers for his album, Auntie Candy and Uncle Rick sent money in his card, and his Auntie Gail and Uncle Tom bought him another subscription to a magazine he really enjoys.</p>
<p>Bryn was so funny as he opened his gifts... when he read the cards he would comment that there was a secret code on the bottom consisting of various numbers and configurations of Xs and Os! He posed with his mouth open in surprise so we could take photos, and generally hammed it up for us all. </p>
<p>The boys were particularly tired, as they had not slept well at their sleepovers (I wonder why they call them that!) and the girls were ready for bed too, as soon as the last gift was opened and admired. </p>
<p>The grown-ups were pretty flaked out too; I did up the dinner dishes and cleaned the kitchen, put another load of wash in, folded a load while watching a little TV and drinking my first cup of tea of the day... but it was late enough that I started nodding off on the sofa. </p>
<p>Kelly kicked me off and sent me upstairs for bed, and here I sit... prepared to get ready right now... but I may call and see if Riku is at home. It's 10:45 and I'm heading up soon to finish off "The Liar's Club"... really enjoying it.</p>
