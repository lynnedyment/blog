								<h2>A Little Bit of This, A Little Bit of That...</h2>
								<p>Stayed in bed dozing for fifteen minutes before throwing off the cover and putting my feet on the floor at 8 a.m. UF was still sleeping, so I sat and wrote up my blogs and emptied all the junk mail off my server. I didn't hear UF get up and shower so by the time I left this room he was more than ready for our breakfast together. We had the wild blueberries from up north on our cereal, and they were just as delicious as Glenn and Wendy had promised they would be. </p>
<p>We both feel that my time here is getting short, and I'm sorry I didn't get an earlier start with the day. UF had moved the last of the furniture from the rec' room back in place before breakfast (no wonder he was hungry!), and while he finished a few things up in the room, I got busy cleaning the kitchen counters very thoroughly. </p>
<p>UF wants less clutter everywhere and we agreed that the old counter protector, now worn away underneath and not looking very clean or attractive, could go. This made a big change and we discussed getting rid of some of the four piece flour/sugar etc. ceramic set as well. I pulled everything off, gave it all a good scrubbing, and went on to the second counter, cleaning the microwave, and clearing a few items from that counter too. The largest container is now tucked way underneath in a corner, so when we get rid of those it will still be a complete set. UF had a good idea to use the next biggest for his green tea, the second for brown sugar, and the smallest for regular tea. This just makes the kitchen more suited to his needs.</p>
<p>I joined him downstairs while he went through each of his videos; he wants to make up new labels for them all so that he can read them without struggling through various scribbles, mostly his own! This took a while as there were unmarked videos that we had to stop and see a bit of, but we threw a few out and UF made up new labels on the computer last night. We will get at those in the morning and cross yet another job off the list (which is getting longer as we come across more things to do). </p>
<p>Before leaving the rec' room, though, we had a peek in the closet we cleaned out last fall, and decided the tennis rackets, an old receiver, and some weights could go, but came across four photo boxes and a big plastic container filled with... more photos! Up they went to the kitchen to be dealt with in our quiet, sit-down moments. However, the closet now contains only a box of old 8 mm movies, which UF doesn't want to think about yet, an old screen, four badminton rackets, a bag of balls in case he has children visit, and his ab machine. He promised that the next time I came he would have abs of steel, or perhaps platinum! </p>
<p>It was a gorgeous sunny and warm day, so I served lunch outside today. We had UF's favourite tomato sandwiches again, with a cup of mushroom soup, and apple juice. UF had the last dish of jello; I must make him more before I leave. </p>
<p>We decided as long as we were outside we would continue with an outdoor job, so while I pulled rhubarb from three separate beds, UF did some serious weeding of thick vines threatening to take over at the side of the house. It was hot work and he was willing to sit in a lawn chair in the shade and top and bottom the rhubarb for me. </p>
<p>I had taken the burners off the stove and had them in the dishwasher so the rhubard got put into a sinkful of cold water until after dinner. I finished cleaning the stove, helped UF get some things back into the headbump space, and we both sat down with a cup of tea and sorted through photos, and more photos. There are lots of stories that go along with the photos and UF tells me all the interesting bits of the older Legion members... this one flew bombers in WW1; this led a team that was wiped out, all but him, in WW11; and of course there are funny stories as well... the gal whom they could never keep away from the microphone at dances even though she had a wretched voice; after her husband died she was determined to win the heart of another man, married, and was successful... and continued to sing! And of course there are the heartbreaking photos of a very young AR and UF with their two little boys, and oh so many of a very curvaceous AR posing for her favourite photographer, Uncle Frank. He has many of these at the computer waiting to go on file here, and in the screensaver mode. </p>
<p>Gerry called and invited us over for a visit at John and Debbie's, who live just down the road from UF, but we were both feeling pretty grubby and in need of second showers by this point. We should have gone, as we ended up not going out the entire day. </p>
<p>I spoke with Donna and we made plans to meet for dinner on Wednesday night. This works well for both of us. Now to make arrangements with Amy and Ian.</p>
<p>I phoned Paul to apologize for not wishing him Happy Birthday when he was by the other day, and to let him know there were some more things here for them. When he volunteered that he and Beth were having barbecued ribs for dinner, I had the audacity to suggest they invite UF over to join them... and that I bring over a potato to bake, but my sister never called back... </p>
<p>Steph' and John came by; John had forgotten his wallet here on Friday and they came in for a cold drink and looked at some of the photos... of AR and UF when they were young, and then of Glenn and Jan when they were first married. Neither could believe how skinny Glenn was and we gave them Glenn's group of sorted photos to take with them. It was such a pleasure for UF to have company here. He likes this young couple so much and would be happy to have them drop in any time at all. </p>
<p>Dinner was late tonight; somehow the hours just slipped by. UF suggested going out but we were ensconced with the photos and it seemed easier to just stay put. I cooked up some penne pasta, and saut√©ed garlic, mushrooms, chopped spinach, and fresh tomatoes, added a small can of Hunt's tomato paste, some herbs, and added a few tiny cubes of Havarti japelpeno cheese when I tossed it all together. We both really enjoyed it and UF is determined to learn how to make himself a dinner like this. I reassured him it was very easy and will make a few notes for him so that he can try it next week. </p>
<p>After dinner, UF went up to the computer room to scan the photos, etc. and I got busy chopping, and chopping, and chopping the rhubarb. The knife wasn't very sharp and there was a LOT of rhubarb, so I finished at 10:30 p.m. I cooked it all down, and now have a big pot to put into bags in the morning. </p>
<p>I tried unsuccessfully to call both Riku and Amelia today, but they were out partying I suppose, perhaps together. Riku goes back to nursery school tomorrow and I will be waiting to hear if he went in happily, or if there will be an adjustment period this term. Sometimes he would say "No school, no children" when school was mentioned so we shall see. </p>
<p>UF had been very quiet so I came up to see how he was doing, finding him sprawled out on his bed, with a book in hand, on the edge of sleep. I gently touched his shoulder, and he sat up, telling me he thought I had gone to bed without saying goodnight! When I told him I had sorted some more photos he came down for our glass of port and of course we got caught up in yet another batch of old black and whites, that AR had sorted into envelopes, hidden away for a few years. UF had totally forgotten about finding them after a robbery many many years ago of the originals so we had another wonderful hour looking at those and discarding lots of blurry or duplicates of coloured shots. </p>
<p>Argggh, bed at 2 a.m.! It's just too hard to pull ourselves away from this job, and we really must force ourselves to not get at it after 11 p.m. I read a few emails, quickly wrote a couple of short ones, and turned out my light at 2:15.</p>
