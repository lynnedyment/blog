								<h2>Tuesday...  Fall Cleaning</h2>
								<p>Today Kelly and I had grand plans to get lots done in the house; we had no children here for lunch, and a full day to work on the basement and the third floor hallway. Alas, we got lots done, but not all that we planned to do. </p>
<p>Kelly had CM work to do on the computer, and so I decided to work on the main floor window cleaning. I started with the sliding patio doors in the kitchen, and Candy called when I had almost finished these. It was a big job, with the tracks needing a major cleaning and Kelly's help was necessary for moving the large glass doors off the frame. I continued on with the front door windows, and had worked my way into the dining room by the time we hung up the phone, an hour and a half later. I was such an inspiration to Candy that she decided to get her window cleaning done too. </p>
<p>Kelly gots lots of office work done while this was going on, and we took a break for a late lunch, watching a little TV while eating. Then, finally, it was time to get at the basement. I vacuumed the storage room while Kelly did the sorting/tossing; I continued on with the laundry in between dashing upstairs with various items for the school, the garbage, and free takeaways at the front curb. Of course we were under full sail when it was time to pick up Myk' and Bry' from school. We really need one full afternoon back at this. Hope it happens. </p>
<p>Kelly made up the usual fruit/snack tray, Bry' went out with Manitou for some ball throwing/catching, Kelly walked them over for their piano lessons, and Alex picked them up for the night with him. </p>
<p>It was sadly obvious that Gregg wasn't home, as we sat down in front of the TV and ate heated up leftover delivered pizza; it was good but not quite up to the usual food standards in this house. Ah, how spoiled I have become! </p>
<p>Right after dinner I made Caillie's chocolate cake for tomorrow's celebration; I shall do the whipping cream filling and icing tomorrow. </p>
<p>Kelly had a three-plus-hour training session with a consultant, so I sat upstairs watching a couple of shows, spent the rest of the time writing emails, and going up and down to the final loads of laundry.</p>
<p>Both of us went up to bed just after 11 p.m. Kelly was tired from three hours of talking/explaining, and I was tired from another busy but productive day.</p>
