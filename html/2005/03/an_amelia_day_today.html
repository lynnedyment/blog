								<h2>An Amelia Day Today</h2>
								<p>Susan had a dentist appointment today which worked out perfectly for all concerned. While Susan had her teeth checked, and spent some time at home doing various chores, Amelia and I played. Doesn't seem fair somehow but it suits us all. Amelia arrived at 9:45 a.m. in time to pull Grandpa around by his little finger while I finished my breakfast and got organized for our walk... water, snacks, and the cuddly bear to help little ones to sleep. And asleep she was, just ten minutes after leaving the house. It's a warm day, warmer than is was just two hours ago when I walked over to the hospital to have my second Hepatitis B shot. I really should have changed out of my light weight sweater and put on a cotton blouse before the walk. </p>
<p>I pushed the stroller up the shady sides of the hilly streets to Noe Valley and was glad to reach the top and coast down. Amelia slept through almost all of the noises, opening her eyes just once when I ventured into a new knitting shop. That shall wait for another day, as I knew she was still sleepy and we continued on.  </p>
<p>Amelia sits up when she has finished her nap and this was just before noon today... perfect timing! We came home and she ate a great lunch... all of her spinach/brown rice combo, all of her quiche, some of my fried potatoes with tomatoes (Amelia LOVES other people's food!), some tapioca pudding and one tiny square of avocado. We "read" some books while we ate, which means that Amelia flipped through them at speed-reading speed, still managing to point out some of the familiar things she knew. I got lots of snuggles and hand-holding too after lunch. </p>
<p>I was busy for a bit in the kitchen and suggested that she go into Riku's room and get some toys; to my surprise Amelia did just that! I think she really enjoys wandering from room to room and finding new-to-her toys and books. I opened the back door and thus she was able to wander in and out a bit on her own; Grandpa was always a second option as she likes to sit on his lap and look at the kaleidescopes on his monitor. I think she also believes he needs a break from staring at that machine and does her best to relieve the boredom for him. </p>
<p>Amelia is starting to use words along with her signing which is new since before the trip to Hawaii. Baby is not only a rocking motion (my favourite of her signs) but now "baby" accompanies it. "More" is another and when Amelia wants more, or doesn't, there is no question about it! This is a girl who knows her mind. </p>
<p>At 3:30 it was obvious that Amelia was ready for another nap, so after consulting with her Mommy, off we went. Our intention was to end up at the playground. Amelia slept for an hour and five minutes this time around and the playground was right around the corner at this point. Good timing! She got busy in the sandbox (thank goodness I had changed into that cotton blouse; it was hot out there!), sharing the sandbox toys with another little girl, climbing up on the playhouse and slide, and taking the sand out of another Mommy's hand. Amelia makes friends wherever she goes. </p>
<p>Susan showed up around 5 p.m. and was greeted with a very big hug around the neck. Amelia does ask for "Mama?" occasionally now, also knew since before Hawaii, so I'm sure she was very happy to see her appear. We spent a few extra minutes before leaving the playground; Amelia would have been happy to stay longer, I'm sure, but didn't fuss at all when put in her car seat. </p>
<p>I accpepted a ride home, as Doug and I were dashing off to see a reading at "M is for Mystery". I fixed us a very small but tasty "snack" and off we dashed. We managed to get good seats for it despite heavy traffic to San Mateo; it was a very good reading and chat session with the author but I could feel myself fading fast. An hour later, I did drift off during a British mystery Doug had taped, but all the walking and sunshine and early morning hours are showing up by early evening these days.</p>
