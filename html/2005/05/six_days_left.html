								<h2>Six Days Left...</h2>
								<p>I was in bed and asleep by 11 p.m. last night, too tired to write my blog or even think about what to say. I read perhaps three paragraphs (still working my way through the stack of New Yorker fiction I brought with me) before turning off my light. </p>
<p>My inner alarm seems to go off at 5:30 a.m. occasionally, but I read, dozed, read, and dozed, until 7:15. The house was very quiet and once again I thought I would get a head start on that blog, but Akane was at the computer and Riku was busy nursing. He woke at 7 a.m. and was very obviously still tired. It took him a while to come 'round (didn't want his diaper changed) which is not surprising after just eight hours sleep. </p>
<p>Soon though he rallied, and was a busy boy with his new cars, until he was ready for a bowl of yogurt and half of a banana. I knew he would be ready for an early nap today, so I got into the shower immediately, had a few nuts, and sat and drank the hot chocolate that Akane had made for me. </p>
<p>Riku and I were out the door at 9:15 (after three "yay Riku" trips to the bathroom already); we walked to the park but there were no children at the playground, so instead we walked around the cemetery grounds, which has a bounty of apparently very interesting rocks; Riku needed a bag for his treasures and was very busy picking up more than he ever has in one trip. Such booty!</p>
<p>As we were walking along, I decided I would teach Riku two things... how to tell someone his name and what to say when someone asks him how he is. Both these things are asked frequently, as well as how old he is. So, we practiced... "How are you?"... "Fine, kank u"... and we worked on "And how are you?" too. He surprised his mom at lunch time with his answers. And he is doing well with "My name is Riku" too, although it might be easier to start with just "Riku". </p>
<p>Riku is an enthusiastic learner and doesn't seem to mind practicing these things one bit. It's adorable. This morning, as we headed out of the building, we ran into the woman who runs the dress shop downstairs; she and Riku are on familiar terms and she was so happy to see him walking toward her. He is so gracious and gave her a big warm smile, saying "ohayo" in response to her "good morning" and then leaving her with "buh bye; see you later!" Many people say "bye bye" here so that is easy. </p>
<p>At 10 a.m. he was in his stroller, eating his grapes followed by the assorted bread items... a few cheese bunnies, some toast, and two tiny pretzels. Nap time followed quickly, as I knew it would. He slept for an hour and twenty minutes. </p>
<p>We just happened to be in the neighbourhood of the gelato place (how fortunate that this is a nice shady street, as it was very warm out there today!), and even though it was obvious that Riku was still a little tired, I decided that it would be better if he was tired for his afternoon nap as well. Otherwise it makes for a very long day for him, and for his caregivers too! So, it was a strawberry gelato for Riku; he held the cup while I took his photo and ate every last bit of it, drinking the melted remains at the end. Every once in a while he would get too much on his spoon and say "That too big!", and would scrape some off. He also said "I like dessert" and we had a little talk about all the others in his life who like dessert too. </p>
<p>It was such a gorgeous day that I kept walking in the shade until 12:45 when we arrived home. Akane had cooked the two of us a most delicious sweet and sour Chinese vegetable and tofu dish and something else for Riki, with noodles and egg perhaps. Whatever it was, he was only interested in eating <strong>my</strong> tofu cubes, and my sweet potato, and my carrots. What a boy, and he does it all with that gleam in his eyes too! </p>
<p>Akane went out on her own for diapers, and Riku and I tidied up our very messy table. It has been covered with dozens of little cars, fire trucks, planes, buses, and trains for two days now, although it seems much longer than that... as well as all of the dishes from his kitchen set. What a sight! So we got busy. Riku likes cleaning up (last night he managed to get hold of a cloth at Buhbuh's and went around "cleaning", much to everyone's amusement), and we got right to it. All the vehicles are now in three boxes and the table is completely cleared, although I must say that his kitchen area leaves a lot to be desired. For some very odd reason, unbeknown to me, he has refused to put the cutlery in the drawers, the casserole dish in the microwave, or the pots and pans in the oven! </p>
<p>Once that big job was done, I gave Riku one of the tofu puddings his uncle and aunt gave to us last night; they heard through the grapevine that I was very fond of them, and we each have a second one to enjoy. Riku has already had both of his. Once again, he sat and ate every bite of it, this one with the caramel sauce, and reiterated that "I like dessert" and "This is yummy!" </p>
<p>He and his mom went to bed at 2:30 p.m. for a nap; I left the house at 5 p.m.! and meandered around the rose gardens for a bit on my own, found a couple of cute summer dresses for a certain little girl in my life, and dropped into the 100 yen store for toothpaste. I arrived home at 6 p.m. to find that Riku had slept until 5:30. He was sitting in a chair, waiting for his dinner, after telling his mommy he was hungry. He was a little out of sorts with this crazy schedule over the past 24 hours but was soon back to feeling a little better after I read "Small Pig" to him as he ate. He is now doing what his daddy did with this book... finishing up most of the last word on each page; I say "he sat down, and sank down, in the good soft... " and Riku says "mud". I always did this with Kelly and Bryn, and then with Bryn and Caillie too; it's fun to do with their favourite books.</p>
<p>Riku ate well, eating all of the rice and veg' dish and about a third of the egg and spinach dish. Of course he wanted "dessert", and Akane brought in a pretty glass dish with a half banana and some kiwi slices. He lost interest almost immediately but I think he was just full.</p>
<p>Another trip to the bathroom (I lost count today as it happens so often now!), and I suggested that we all head out for a little walk in the park. Akane was reluctant, but Riku said "Mommy come?" and so off we all went. It was a lovely evening, milder than when I was out earlier, as the wind had died down. We ran into the little family of five children today... they came running up as we left through the driveway, not our usual route. There was Aya, and Yui (Akane asked her about the spelling), their five-year-old sister, their two-year-old brother and tonight I met the ten-year-old "big" brother... in charge of all of them on his own. The girls told Akane that they had been to the playground after school so they could practice their English! I felt sorry about this, as I could have gone there instead of to the park; it had crossed my mind when I left, I but didn't go with my instincts. I promised them I would be there tomorrow after school, and had Akane ask them to bring paper and pencils with them. I will try to remember to take a couple of books with me too.... perhaps "Are You My Mother?"</p>
<p>It had just turned dark, Riku spotted a half moon, and we went right over to check that his little stash of rocks and sticks were where we left them yesterday morning. Phew! They were there and he added a few more choice rocks to the site. He sat in the sandbox for a bit, just drawing lines; Akane strolled around some, Riku ran up a couple of little hills ("You're the King of the Castle, I'm the Dirty Rascal", I now sing to him), and Akane suggested that instead of going home right away we go to another supermarket I haven't been to, much smaller than the one we go to downstairs. Their prices are much higher and we checked out a second one as well; Riku was getting tired, sitting down to rest on various perches and in the second store asking me to carry him. He is quite a heavy little weight now, especially when he is tired; I'm going to have to get back to the gym!  </p>
<p>Getting him all the way to the door required some ingenuity on my part... "ready, set, <strong>go</strong>!", and off we all went, practicing our galloping and hiding behind pillars, but he still lay down on the floor a couple of times... pulling faces that made us laugh... eyes rolled up and a funny grimace on his face, that he often pulls when he finds a mirror at his level. </p>
<p>He knows the routine... knew it was bedtime, but said "snack?" and so finished off his banana and kiwi, with a big drink of water. He did ask for a bath but I hadn't heated the water (takes about twenty minutes); it was already late enough and he was a tired boy for certain. So, off came the shoes, "roll, roll, roll" he said as he pulled off his socks and balled them up to stick in his shoes, off came the pants, the diaper, and the shirt with a little help, and yes, another successful bathroom trip. I wonder how long it will take before that look of wonder disappears each time he urinates? It is too cute to see right now! I gave him a nice warmish sink "tubtime" in the bathroom, he asked for the duck to join him and they had a splashy few minutes together, nice big towel, and time for pj's and teeth. He pulls on his undershirt, lays his pj bottoms flat on the floor and sticks his legs in, pulls each one up until his feet show up, and then stands up and struggles to get those bottoms up, even at the back. Bryn, you are going to just love all this! </p>
<p>He was ready to tuck in with his mommy at 8:45 p.m. Akane may be in for the night as well, as she also brushed her teeth before going in to the bedroom with him. Now 9:30 and that's it... the earliest I have finished up a blog this trip! I plan to be in bed in half an hour.</p>
