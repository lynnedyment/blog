								<h2>A Rainy Day... and a Hair Cut Too</h2>
								<p>Last night was not a good one for sleeping; I did however get lots of reading done and heard Riku cry out at 2 a.m. He went right back to sleep and woke at 6:15... a good (almost) ten hours sleep for him. I got out of bed immediately; he needed a diaper change and told me about it. Akane was up soon after. Today I asked Riku if he would like an egg, porridge, or yogurt and his answer was porridge. He ate a huge bowl and then said he would have some toast as well. I put a slice of his favourite "bacon" on the plate too and it disappeared first. </p>
<p>I was in the shower early and when I came out, Riku was watching "A Bug's Life". I sat with him on my lap and we watched a bit of it together until my breakfast. We also had time for "Frog and Toad are Friends" and "Small Pig", while I ate the breakfast potatoes Akane had cooked up for me. Riku told me he next wanted the book with the "baby crying", a Japanese board book. I went through the pages with him, but didn't see a crying baby. I asked him where it was and he took the book from me, flipped the pages from the back to the front and showed me the crying baby. He knows his books, this boy! </p>
<p>Just an aside... Riku is always a little worried when he hears a baby or child crying; he cranes his neck around to see where it is and likes to see a mommy or daddy "fit it". When he sees a baby or slightly older child crying now he often says "baby tired", after he heard Akane and me talking about a child in a restaurant a few days ago. He is going to be a good daddy; he picks up these things quickly. </p>
<p>One thing I did this morning with Riku was to bring one of his sandals into the dining room and show him how to "thread" the two straps into the plastic guide. He really wants to learn, and pays such close attention. I showed him twice and then he wanted to do it; it was a bit of a struggle as the guide is not very thick and the strap just fits into it but he did it. And when we were leaving the house, Riku sat down and got right to it; it was harder, too, as his foot was now in the sandal but he twisted around and figured out how it had to be done. He never ever wants anyone to take his sandals or shoes off, or to undo the laces or straps. Each night he pulls on his own pj bottoms too, and the next step it to buy him pj's or shirts with big buttons and buttonholes. He's ready for this for sure. </p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Goda were to pick Akane up between 9:30 and 9:45 this morning for the trip to Osaka to see Akane's grandmother. She is not well enough to have Riku running about her room, so he and I were in the park at 9:25 a.m. It was a very cloudy, overcast, gray day which meant the park was almost deserted. After five minutes, though, a little girl Riku's age (she will be three one month later than Riku) showed up, and the two of them had such a fun time at the fountain. Riku was leaning way over, although not with his knees up, and this little girl did everything he did, including the running around the fountain, being very loud! and throwing themselves at a new area, with hands dangling in the water. </p>
<p>I had bought batteries yesterday for my camera and they were already depleted after twenty or so photos by late afternoon. I am so disappointed I didn't get a photo of these two children together. Riku had headed up a hill on his own, collecting stones, and the other child went off in another direction. I think Riku was quite surprised she wasn't right behind him, so he went off to her area to play. It started to rain, unfortunately, as we all four stuck it out for about fifteen minutes before heading indoors to the mall. I managed to have a fellow help figure out the battery problem so that was a relief. I really would have been so disappointed not to have photos of my last two days here. </p>
<p>Up to the apartment for a nap for Riku; he had a snack and a story first, and off we went. He slept for an hour, which was fine; I imagine he will catch a few winks later on when we are out in the afternoon. We were catching a train at 3:07 to meet Akane for Riku's haircut. When he woke up he was "hungry!". Me too! Akane had left a bowl of my favourite sauteed lotus root on the table and Riku and I shared that before our main course. Yummy! Riku had a big bowl of pasta with extra spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes;  I finished up the last of the ginger "chicken" I had brought with me, covered with sauteed spinach and mushrooms. Akane had also made up a potato salad before she left (she was just leaving as we came in at 11 a.m.), trying to use up some of the large amount of fresh veggies we still have on hand. It hit the spot and Riku had some apple slices for dessert. </p>
<p>I washed Riku's hair, and he sat in a chair while I pretended to cut his hair again; I think he has it down now. He says "Riku not cry" and "It's OK, woman cut hair, it's OK". "Riku happy!" He was delighted to see there was some strawberry gelato left from last night; he smiled with every bite of it.  </p>
<p>Off to the train station, with Riku in his stroller and armed with our rain coats. Everything went as planned and Akane was just where she was supposed to be at the end of this trip of ours. We walked about fifteen minutes to her hairdresser and it went oh-so-well! Riku sat in the chair the entire time, didn't shed a tear, despite a lot of hair falling on his face and bothering his eyes and nose. He had been given a squirt bottle with water in it, and that certainly kept him occupied! Since I was within very close range, holding his head a bit more still, or cupping his chin up or down, I was a little damp at the end of this cut; he mostly did squirt it at the mirrors though. Riku's hair is as short as it has ever been cut, and my, what a handsome boy he is! His bangs are very short and the close cut made the most sense going back to San Francisco. I hope that Akane will get a photo up tomorrow, possibly to send out. </p>
<p>I took off his shirt, we got a damp cloth and wiped down his face, neck, back, and tummy. Akane and the hairdresser both worked on getting as much of the hair off his shirt as they could, and off we went for the train, homeward bound. </p>
<p>Akane had made reservations for us at a Chinese restaurant she likes very much in this neighbourhood. Riku had some yogurt to tide him over, while we waited for our vegetarian prepared "country" meal. It was so very good, every bite of it. We had bok choy to start, with a couple of other veggies in the dish. Riku liked it a lot and ate a generous amount of it. But the noodle dish was his favourite... long, thin noodles with yet more veggies, and a delicious "gravy" to top it off. There was also a tofu dish, which was very very tasty as well. I enjoyed it so much and it was a great way to finish off our day. Akane drew some wonderful creatures for Riku when he had had his fill... a perfect little fish, a tiny octopus, a great little turtle, and the most amazing dragon, none larger than an inch long or wide. Then she cut them out carefully and handed them to Riku as she finished them. </p>
<p>Riku had been "drawing" on the little piece of paper in Akane's notebook. She had, on another day, drawn a few things... a heart, a fish, a couple of animals I think, and tonight Riku, starting with the fish, drew a circle around each one of them, totally enclosing each one individually in one stroke... not circles, but ponds, we were told. We were impressed. </p>
<p>It was pouring rain when we stepped out at 7 p.m. I still had to get to the gelato place, as the owner had said he would make coconut gelato for me. I was awfully tempted not to venture any further in the rain, but knew I would regret letting him down. He is closed tomorrow and we leave on Tuesday, so this really was my last chance to get in there. Akane brought Riku back to the apartment, I borrowed her umbrella and ventured off into the dark and stormy night. Actually, it was quite mild and I do enjoy walking in the rain, once I get out in it. It is a very fast ten or twelve minute walk and I was warm when I got there; it stopped raining at the door too, so it must have been in the cards to go tonight. </p>
<p>I believe the owner's wife was behind the counter tonight; it was the first time I had seen her there, but the owner immediately came out to say hello. I poured my change out on the counter to make sure I had enough for three cups; I used the last of my bills on a train pass today. I had enough... phew! I ordered the coconut, of course, Akane had chosen mango tonight, and Riku's is a given... strawberry. <br />
The owner speaks a bit of English and I confirmed that I was a Canadian, that I live in San Francisco, as does my grandson and his mom, and my son. He told me he hoped we would meet again, and I reassured him I would no doubt see him in December. Then he told me he had given me a gift... a container of his apple gelato! What a lovely man he is. I told him I had meant to bring my camera so I could take his photo; he bowed and said he was honored. It was all quite wonderful and I too hope I get to see him again and eat more of his delicious gelato! </p>
<p>Riku was watching some of his delayed "Bug's Life" when I walked in. No bath tonight, or even a sink bath for the very first time since I arrived. He probably needed it too, as I'm sure there are a few loose hairs hanging about. I intended to eat only half of my coconut treat, but it was far too good to put off! Akane was much more disciplined, and will be enjoying more of her mango tomorrow. Riku sat happily eating and watching TV, taking his own little bites and refusing any help with holding the container or spooning it out. </p>
<p>Just at that point, Akane's dad arrived bearing ice cream!... packed in dry ice. Riku fed Jiji some of his strawberry dessert (what a suprise; he doesn't usually like to share his favourite foods!) and then the two of them sat down to explore the wonders of dry ice. I took lots of photos of them, as Riku was quite intrigued and ended up stirring it up with a whisk and then a big serving spoon from his kitchen. That lasted quite a while, and when it was done, Jiji put on his favourite TV show. Riku was fascinated... swords and loud voices and "woman angry" and "man angry"... he couldn't take his eyes off it; I was hoping no one would get his head lopped off, as it was going in that direction. We have had no "kung fu" moves around here lately and I'd like to see that continue! </p>
<p>Just in the nick of time, Akane's aunt, uncle, and cousin Chika, came in for a visit. I had managed to pull Riku away from the TV for teeth brush and pjs so he would be all ready for bed when they left. They arrived just before 8:30, and stayed only a half hour. Perfect, really, as Riku was going on only a one-hour nap after a very busy day. It would be a shame to have it end in tears. They are a very warm and loving family; they were all down on the floor with Riku, laughing at all his many antics (the latest seems to be showing off his big belly to anyone who pays any attention at all to him!), watching him play with his toys, and chatting with him. Akane and I both took photos. Jiji had left about fifteen minutes earlier, with kisses on both cheeks from Riku, and a big squeeze. We won't likely see him again this trip. </p>
<p>Riku and I had time for a Franklin book, and then another while Akane brushed her teeth and washed; she was on her way to bed with him too. He went over to choose one; he picked up a board book and said, "Oh! This is a good one. Let's read this!" That was quite a sentence but then every day I marvel at how much he has learned and is learning. Akane says it is also true for his Japanese; that each day he has learned new words or expressions. The most amazing thing of all is the ease with which he switches back and forth between them, always using English for me and almost always using Japanese with his mom... and for those in the elevators... it varies. He tries both and often says "bye bye" or "sorry" in English. </p>
<p>He was tucked in at 9:20, and I do hope that he manages to sleep past his 6-ish waking tomorrow... he needs some extra hours tonight. I'm off to read myself to sleep.</p>
