								<h2>Happy Mother's Day</h2>
								<p>... and it started off just perfectly with a little fellow snuggled in bedside me, fast asleep, until 7:28 a.m.!  I had a few minutes lying awake beside him, just enjoying that little boy sleeping so peacefully. And then he was awake! and up! and ready to start his day. </p>
<p>Bryn had sent an envelope with me for Akane for Mother's Day but when she opened it there were two other envelopes inside; one for me and one for Riku, asking us to take care of each other. I didn't see Akane's but Bryn told me later that the three fit together to form a little puzzle so I will see that later on. He also sent three tiny boxes, each holding two chocolates; neither Akane nor I were quite sure what they were for, or for whom, but they are for us!!! Riku is delighted but we two haven't eaten ours yet. We must give them to Riku earlier in the day in case he is caffeine sensitive; we don' t need this child staying awake any longer at night! </p>
<p>We had our very typical morning routine.... breakfast immediately, a couple of stories at the table, "kitchen" time for Riku, and today, getting ready to leave the house at 10 a.m. for a Mother's Day treat from Akane and Bryn... a pedicure for me at Takishimaya! Mrs. Goda is going to have her first manicure at the same time. I had understood yesterday that Mrs. Goda had a school reunion meeting to go to so we would not be seeing her. However, Akane had spoken with her mom last night while I was bathing Riku; she was feeling so rotten when I went in to ask her about sleeping arrangements for Riku that she forgot to tell me about the pedicure. What a nice surprise! </p>
<p>The plan was to leave at 10 a.m. and catch a bus; I preparedd snacks for Riku, as well as some lunch to take with us and Akane got involved with laundry, lost track of the time, and was late bathing. Instead of taking the bus we took a cab at 10:35. Riku was very excited by this prospect; we walked over to the taxi stand and he climbed happily into the back, saying "hi man" to the driver, who obviously had no idea he was being spoken to.  Riku could see buses, buildings, and cranes from the back seat, and the ride was over too soon for him. I told Riku he could say goodbye to the man; he did, the man smiled and said "bye bye" back to him, leaving our boy smiling. </p>
<p>We met Mr. and Mrs. Goda at the door of the store, said a quick hello goodbye to him, and off we went to the nail salon on the fourth floor. Akane was planning to walk with Riku in the stroller for his nap and meet us in an hour. After Akane filled out my form, I was shown into a private little room for my pedicure while finger nails were done in the front space of the "salon".</p>
<p>Well, to say this manicure was bliss would be an understatement. I was almost asleep during the soaking/masssage part of the treatment. The young woman doing my treatment was very sweet and very good at what she does; she spoke a bit of English, having taken a three month course following a trip to Australia two years ago. I was in the room for an hour and a quarter, getting scrubbed, soaked, massaged, pumiced, moisturized, polished and relaxing. It was heavenly and such a perfect gift for me. I had done my own toenails just before leaving home but after all the walking and the poor job I did myself, it was a treat to have them looking so good again. </p>
<p>Akane's mom had pale pink polish on her nails and a tiny flower on one of them, a Mother's Day promotion. She was very pleased with them; they looked very nice, and my guess is she will be doing this again. She and Akane were chatting, waiting for me, and Riku had fallen asleep in his stroller just ten minutes earlier, after a stop at a fruit booth for fresh fruit and drinks. </p>
<p>Mrs. Goda had made arrangements not to go to the reunion meeting, so planned so spend some time with us. Off we went for lunch, at a little spot that specializes in tempura. It looked very familiar to me, and I told Akane I was sure we had been there last trip and sat at a corner table. She assured me I was correct; Bryn and Ayako had been with us too, before Riku was born, </p>
<p>I had the luncheon special, along with her mom and herself, but they substituted broccoli for the shrimp for me. Riku lay sleeping beside me in his stroller, needing to be soothed just twice over the next two busy hours. </p>
<p>We caught a train to Namba, a very popular and busy shopping area in Osaka. Akane and her mom are shoppers and like to browse. This was fine with me as I wanted Riku to be moving and sleeping as long as possible. At one point they were admiring, as was I, some small and lovely leather handbags with the extra attraction of being made in such a way that they go from being a shoulder bag to fastening around the waist... a high class version of a fanny pack. They were discussing colours and I was soothing Riku as he stirred a bit; Mrs. Goda showed me a turquoise blue bag, and I agreed that it was lovely. Akane told me that she was meaning for me to have one! and did I like this colour! They were quite expensive and I tried to say it wasn't at all necessary for her to buy one for me, but we all three ended up with one.... Akane and I both have black ones and Mrs. Goda a beige one. I felt quite guilty about it, as I had also tried to buy our lunch and Akane told me it was fine, that her mother was happy to pay for it. I am now the proud owner of a very gorgeous little bag that I would have loved but would never have bought for myself! Lucky me! </p>
<p>Riku woke up and needed to be fed, so we went off to a tea shop, set in the middle of one of the floors of this elegant store. Akane ordered Assam tea for us, Mrs. Goda had green tea, and we all chose a dessert. Mine was a plain cheesecake, Akane's a mocha cake I believe, and Mrs. Goda had a cake with cherries baked into it. While we were waiting for it, I fed Riku a good sized portion of oatmeal and strawberries I had brought with me. Apparently my cheesecake was very good as he ate all but two tiny bites of it, and many bites of his baa-baa's (as Bryn has told me it should be spelled). </p>
<p>Mrs. Goda left us after tea, to catch a bus to visit her mom in another area of Osaka. Akane wanted to look for some comfortable skirts with elastic waistbands at their favourite clothing store, Muji. The minute we stepped inside Riku asked "Where the blocks?" Akane was amazed as he was there just once with Bryn a while back and obviously remembered just from stepping in the store that this was the place with blocks! We went downstairs immediately to that area (well, I stopped for a few moments to see if I could find a pair of cotton pj's for myself... no luck) and while Akane poked around and took her time looking for some clothes, Riku and I sat on the mat while he built to his heart's content. There were two trays of letters and plain blocks.... Japanese and English and also some wooden "food" with velcro along with a wooden knife. That was being used constantly by other children but as soon as he could Riku got his hands on that.   </p>
<p>Little note here: while changing Riku in the large and very efficient children's changing room (padded and separated changing sections, a sink for washing hands and one for cleaning bottoms, waste baskets, and diapers and juice for sale... really wonderfully thought out) Riku noticed a bruise on his knee. "What's this?" he asked. It was where the child had kicked him yesterday, a three sectioned bruise just to the side of his knee. No wonder he cried so hard; it wasn't just hurt feelings. It is still being discussed a day later. </p>
<p>Another note: in most public bathrooms in the bigger stores there are choices of "western style" toilets and "Japanese style", Since a always wear pants it is much more efficient to use the western style, but the other day I didn't want to wait and used the Japanese toilet. It is a bit of a challenge to stoop while holding aside the fabric of the pants but I thought at the time that it wasn't very efficient to have the paper behind one! I thought to take the paper first, smart girl that I am. Today I also didn't want to wait for the one western style stall, so went in to the other... and realized that I had sat on the other backwards the other day! The raised "back" of it was really the front and there was the paper, just where it should be! Akane laughed when I told her! Ah well, one lives and one learns. I did think though Gail that if you ever used one you might never get up again! It's very low and not easy but I guess in time I would have great leg muscles. I do wonder how some of these very frail, thin, and elderly women manage though.</p>
<p>Akane lucked out with the clothes, finding a nice skirt, extra tights, and some cute three-quarter length pants for Riku, in a navy and white stripe.  It was time to head for home, but after walking to the underground found out there had been an accident so had a long walk back to the train station. Along the way, we passed three huge aquariums with darting goldfish, blue and red fish and some black and white ones. Riku was of course very interested in them; I stopped often, showing him things that would interest him, as he did have to stay in the stroller and had been in it for a long time already. He had some meandering time in the stores though, and a couple of salesclerks, who stopped him to chat, exclaimed how much like me he looked! Akane and I agreed later that it isn't that he looks so much like me but that he doesn't look fully Japanese, so the Causacian features are mine. He does attract lots of attention here though although I think a good part of it is that he is so open and friendly to everyone. Most younger children here are quite shy and so he stands out from the crowd. And of course he is gorgeous... there is that! </p>
<p>Riku had snacks on the train, and once home he gobbled up those cherry tomatoes again while his dinner was being put on the table. He ate one piece of "ebi", the tempura shrimp Akane brought home, I made him scrambled eggs with cheese melted in it, he had some walnut and raisin bread that Akane had picked up for me (delicious and I think not white flour... we did look for some whole grain bread while we were out and found one short loaf of half-grain for 50 cents a slice), and then ate strawberries, apple slices, and a banana for dessert. </p>
<p>It was too late to go out to the park, as had been my intention. Riku didn't have any outside time today for the first time since I arrived. He was outside of course, during our walking around, but he didn't have any running time. He was a busy but tired fellow after dinner; I decided to give him a sink bath as I had forgotten to press the button to heat the tub water and twenty minutes was too late to wait. However, Akane, who went to rescue a plastic duck from the tub for us, assured me that the tub water had maintained its temperature (it has three heavy duty covers over it) and so in he went. I took some photos of this happy boy; he really enjoys the water and it obviously relaxes him before bedtime. </p>
<p>I read him "Small Pig", of course! and also "Franklin's Pet Problem" before bedtime tonight; at one point in the book Franklin is trying to decide what pet he should get. One of his friends suggests a goldfish; I pointed to the fish and (thinking of the aqarium today) asked if he remembered what this fish was called. He wrinkled up his forehead, thought about it and said solemnly "goldfish... yum, yum!" I guess those fish tanks just made him think of dinner! </p>
<p>He was tucked in by his mom at 8:30 p.m., back out fifteen minutes later with what Akane thought was a BM,,,, but a false alarm it was, and back they went to her room. I blogged and blogged, answered a few emails while Akane watched tv, giving over her computer to me for as long as I needed it. At some point though Bryn came in to chat on IM, I went back to the blogs, and both Akane and me ended up going to bed far too late... 12:15 a.m.! Akane has mostly been going to bed with Riku or at 10:30 or so, so this was a late night for both of us. I think I read for three minutes and was sound asleep. </p>
<p>This was a wonderful day; we were all outside during a sunny day, the three moms here celebrated together, and just before I turned off the computer there was a lovely email from Kelly, wishing me a Happy Mother's day, thanking me for helping make her the mom she is. There is nothing she could have said that could have made me happier.</p>
