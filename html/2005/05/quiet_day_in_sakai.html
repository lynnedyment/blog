								<h2>Quiet Day in Sakai</h2>
								<p>Woke up at 6:45 after a great sleep, with a little boy knocking at my door, peeking in, shutting the door, and repeating it, giggling all the while. We got right up and had breakfast; Riku not quite so hungry this morning but ate his yogurt and a few banana bites. He entertained himself very nicely for a good half hour or more this morning; I am finding that the more running around time he has outdoors that the less attention he needs inside. I think he's pretty tired after all the stimuation and so is happy playing on his own. </p>
<p>I got started at my blog again and then it was time for his little tv show. I watched for a few minutes with him before going off to shower. When I finished up, Akane and Riku were in bed for naps so I sat and enjoyed the hot chocolate Akane had prepared for me and a dozen almonds. The phone rang during this time, waking both Akane and Riku, but he was quite willing to go back into the bedroom with Akane. </p>
<p>A few minutes later there was a knock on the door, and there was a flower delivery... for me! from Akane and Bryn. A lovely bouquet of soft colours... pale pink roses, some very pale lilac delicate flowers, new to me, gorgeous peach coloured roses, a few deeper pink, and two pale yellow mums, all smaller versions that is typical... beautiful. Akane had arranged for them on the day she was out with Ayako. </p>
<p>Riku slept only an hour in total but happily sat at the table drawing. We also read both Franklin books before he was ready to get down and play with his cars. As soon as I finished a blog, Riku and I went over to the big park for some fresh air and exercise. This was just the best part of the day for me, as it is a large and today, mostly empty, space. Riku was oh-so-happy just wandering about... up the small hill (he is practicing running down these days), and then up the longer and less steep hill, stopping now and again on this rock and pebble strewn area to stoop down and pick up a rock. "Oh, a rock!" says Riku as though  they are a rare commodity. I guess that particular rock is, in Riku's mind! He struggles to keep all these rocks in his hands, and sometimes passes them on to me if a particular stick catches his eye. </p>
<p>He did wander over to the playground but the slide was very wet from the rain yesterday and he changed his mind. There is a cemetery right next door though; I had noticed stone statuary a few days ago but had not realized it was a cemetery until Riku and I climbed up the hill. So, we meandered around there, noticing several people coming to light incense, fold their hands together and bow in front of the statues, all with a red apron-like cloth tied around their middles or a band on their heads. The statues surround one edge of the cemetery so we walked around the inner area as well; it's not very well maintained, with long grass and lots of weeds around many of the individual gravestones and the big family blocks of several monuments. Riku discovered quite a well-kept one, one of the larger ones there, surrounded by the most beautiful red and yellow stones. He had to be convinced to leave them behind! A young man came in while we were there, and I noticed on our way out that he had poured buckets of water over one stone of several on that site, and then stood bowing for a few minutes, before dashing off on his motor scooter. </p>
<p>Riku was obviously flagging by the end of this adventure so I put him in his stroller for snacks (the rest of his banana, a few pretzels and a dozen or so cheddar cheese bunnies from Auntie Susan). I thought we would walk for a bit but it started to rain so home we went. Akane prepared ww pasta with spinach and tomatoes for him, after asking for pasta!, but he wasn't eating much. Meanwhile, I prepared a "bacon" and egg sandwich for myself... and you can guess what happened. He wanted some "bacon" so I bribed him... one bite of pasta and a tiny bite of "bacon"; this worked very well until he decided he wanted some egg too. I ended up with only a half sandwich for lunch today. </p>
<p>He and Akane went to bed after a little playtime but it was a short nap again. He ate blueberries and apricots for his snack along with a few bites of his mom's rice. Time to get playing again and once again he wrapped up his dog and zebra and walked around being such a good "daddy" to them. </p>
<p>Akane didn't feel well from about 3:30 on. She was worried about the pregnancy, as there had been signs she hadn't experienced before. Bryn was on IM and they chatted about it before Bryn got me online to see what I thought about it; the best thing would have been for Akane to see her doctor but he is not available after 1 p.m. Bryn contacted their on-call doctor who assured him that all was probably well and told us what signs to look for if a problem did exist... shivering, cramping, high fever, etc. Thank goodness none of these are an issue but it was a worrisome time. </p>
<p>Feeling somewhat assured, and after reading a bit to Riku, Akane dressed and we all went out to the library on the third floor of this building. Riku and I settled in on the mat of the children's area, after taking off our shoes, while Akane continued on to the grocery store. </p>
<p>Riku had such a good time, pulling out all the train and truck books he could find, which included a dozen "Thomas the Train" books in Japanese.  A little girl, about eleven months old, came in with her mom. She was the sweetest little thing, smiling away at me and trying to get over to Riku's stack of books. He was very attentive to her; he cooed at her and said "hi baby", touched her cheek gently with his finger, lay down on the floor near her and showed her books... her mother was delighted with him and I was very proud of him. We were there about forty-five minutes, then went outside intending to take a little stroll. However, it was raining and blowing so back to the mall we went and up to the 29th floor. Riku walked in calling for his mom, but she wasn't there; a few minutes later there she was, with the water jug and some groceries. I felt quite reassured knowing she was feeling well enough to have stayed out so long. </p>
<p>Riku was hungry; the minute he asks for yogurt it is time to get some solid food in him. Once a day is the rule for yogurt, so I put out a plate of cherry tomatoes, half a slice of buttered ww toast (brought from SF... it's really hard to find full whole wheat bread here), and after eating that he ate a full serving of four grain cereal and most of a container of ice cream. It was really frozen solid but Riku scraped away patiently at it with the edge of his spoon and did a great job of working his way through three quarters of it. At one point Akane asked if she could have a bite; it was a very tiny bite and so she asked again. Once more she got a mere scraping of ice cream even though his own bites seem to be much larger! However, once he had had enough he was more than happy to give the container to Akane. </p>
<p>After dinner, Riku rode his "car" around, making very loud noises and wheeling around the furniture at breakneck speed, slowed down long enough to make a meal for us in his kitchen, calling out "dinner's ready!" when he was finished, and then looking at a magazine with his mom for a bit. </p>
<p>Once again I gave him a sink wash and then a standing play time in the soaking tub; he is such a relaxed little fellow after this routine that I am reluctant to give it up. He really loves making big splashing wave action and asked for the duck song again. Riku really relaxes while having lotion applied to his legs, arms, tummy and back. Akane sets up the diaper and shirt and then sits with us while I do his little routine with the massage. </p>
<p>Before tuck in time, Riku had another half slice of toast and half a banana which he ate while having his story of choice... "Small Pig" read to him. Once again he went back time and time again to the junk yard page to name all of the things on the page. </p>
<p>Akane tucked him in at 9 p.m. and stayed in with him for the night; I blogged and emailed until 12:10 but was asleep by 12:30.</p>
<p>Today would have been Mrs. Dyment's birthday; I thought several times today of how much she would have enjoyed getting to know this little fellow of Bryn's and Akane's. I know she would have been as smitten as the rest of us.</p>
