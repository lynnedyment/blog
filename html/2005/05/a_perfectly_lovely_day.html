								<h2>A Perfectly Lovely Day!</h2>
								<p>Once again I shall start off my blog by talking about my sleeping patterns!... waking at 3:30 a.m. and realizing that I am not making progress here at all! I think I am too warm and last night there were lots of sirens going off, and making a racket for a long time.  ,I did read and doze however, until I heard Riku being restless, starting at 5:30 a.m. He did go back to sleep though until 7 a.m. which is when I got up as well, </p>
<p>Riku is ready for his "yougurtttt!, as soon as he wakens so he had his usual breakfast and then played happily for a long time on his own with his blocks. Often he wants company (but don't try to help.... he just wants your presence, not your ideas!) but today was happy just to come and visit while I deleted those never-ending junk mails and wrote to Doug. Riku has a little riding car here and was carting along the five little rocks he brought home from the park last night., chatting with me as I wrote.</p>
<p>Breakfast time for me... Akane had made me a cup of hot chocolate, a treat, since I haven't had any since arriving, and I decided to have a bigger breakfast today of egg, toast, and "bacon". I thought Rike was engrossed in his children's tv program but no, he discovered I was eating and decided he really liked my sandwich! He ate a third of my first half and all of the second half!... grinning away as I protested. </p>
<p>Ayako, Akane's sister called to say she had the day off and suggested that she and Akane meet for lunch. I suggested they spend the day together, as there are lots of things here to keep Riku and I busy. Akane was delighted; Riku and I left at 10:15, leaving Akane time on her own to get ready, and walked over to the big playground. It was very hot and there is no protection, and the sandbox smelled of cat litter (to put it nicely). I scooped up as much as I could find (look for the flies hovering!) as Riku is far more interested in the sandbox than the single slide there. Other children joined us and Riku shared his toys, even though he always protests when it is suggested. Once the children are there he is Mr. Generosity.After building a few mountains with the others, we headed home at 11:30. too hot to be out there any longer. We did, however, walk through the gorgeous and huge rose garden, which will be in full bloom in a week or two with this heat. The paths are made of tiny stones, and paved, with uphills and paths heading down, so Riku was happy to just meander about on his own, checking once in a while to make sure I was watching him. </p>
<p>Home at noon hour and lunch was a big bowl of oatmeal with sliced, and very sweet, strawberries, some of which he ate while waiting for the cereal to cook. When Riku is hungry he always asks for yogurt! so I am now trying to have something else ready he can snack on immediately. He was down for his nap at 12:50, awake a half hour later!, and rocked into the second phase, sleeping until 3 p.m. </p>
<p>My lunch time, and I finished off the bit of leftover tofu/cabbge dish of Akane's, edaname beans, cold, and delicious!, the rest of the seaweed and mekabu salad, finishing off with tea and some quiet time for reading. </p>
<p>Snack time for Riku when he awoke... the rest of his toast, 1/2 of a banana, then the other half!, and dried cranberries and blueberries. This boy is happiest with a full tummy and I do my best to keep him happy.  While snacking, Riku often draws and today wanted me to draw along with him. He asked for a very specific thing though this time... his Daddy in a boat. We also talked about lightning and thunder, and he made lots of facial gestures to demonstrate that he knew just what I meant... hands over ears for "loud crashing" and  squinting for the lightning... very amusing for his Nana. </p>
<p>At 4 p.m. we left for our second outing of the day, but today Riku wanted to go "other way" when we left the building. What a good thing that I listened to him, as we discovered a lovely little playground between our building and the next... a small sandbox, a few spring riding toys, a little "woods" in behind (really the landscarping but with enough room for little ones to explore and still be easily seen), all in a vast protected area with no cars. Perfect! There were four other children there with their two moms, one of whom was particularly friendly with me and with Riku. Riku shared his shovels and pails so nicely, and theyin  turn let him play with their toys too. One of the moms handed out little packets of cookies, which won Riku's affection immediately! Riku loves to look at and admire growing things, so he went off collecting sticks and rocks in amongst the tiny bushes and small trees, and soon he had a whole crew helping him out. It was adorable and of course I took photos. </p>
<p>Riku was not happy to leave the area, so I told him he could use the key to open the door. You just hold the key in front of a sensor and was that a hit! Two big sliding doors opened up at his command, and he just beamed at his prowess! Of course he also always pushed the buttons for the "up" and "down" and the floor numbers as well. We just let others go ahead of us each time so they don't spoil his fun by pushing the buttons for him. </p>
<p>While waiting for his dinner, Riku had 1/2 slice of ww toast and five cherry tomatoes cut in half. Meanwhile, I cooked up ww "soupy" pasta for his dinner, with finely chopped spinach, mushrooms, tin<br />
bites of squash ; it was a huge hit with him. After two bites, he said "this is yummy". I thanked him and five bites later he told me again; this happened about five times throughout the meal! It was just so cute but he obviously enjoyed it very much, eating another half a bowl of it! </p>
<p>Tonight I bathed him in the sink, washing him down with soap and rinsing it off before standing him in the tall tub of cool water. I wasn't sure how to turn on the heat for the tub, but he was happy to slip in and then stand playing with his watering can and the two tub basins.</p>
<p>A very funny thing happened that deserves its own paragraph. As I put Riku in the tub, I told him that he had to tell me if he wanted to have a BM. This is a soaking tub  only, and filled high with water, so a BM floating around in there would not have been a good thing! At one point during play time, he said "uh oh!" and I asked him what was wrong. He said it again and I quickly picked him where he immediately let go of his bowels and left a large deposit on the covering of the tub! Whew! Good for him! He was very pleased with himself and it bodes well for toilet training as he obviously knew what was going to happen. A quick trip to the bathroom, another wash in the sink and back in the tub for a few more minutes of play time. Riku had quite the evening retelling me the story over and over! </p>
<p>It was humid so I left him in his diaper (after first putting him on the toilet) and he played with his dishes and blocks until Akane came home at 8:30. She and Ayako had a wonderful day out together and Akane came home bearing a wonderful gift for Riku.... a set of plastic food, stuck together with velcro, which can then be "cut" with a plastic knife. Riku had such a great time; he served us cake, cut into fours (with some effort!), oranges, melon,   hamburger, with and without a bun.... such fun! </p>
<p>It was hard to convince him it was bedtime but he was a tired boy and more than ready for it. after a promise of a bedtime story. He tucked in at 8:50 and was asleep at 9:15.I ate too late.... a bit of this and a bit of that, and then headed off to bed to read at 10:15.</p>
<p>p.s.</p>
<p>two cute extras:<br />
overheard Riku saying "Good job!" to one of his animals today and when I asked him, as he sat playing after lunch if he knew what time it was he looked up with his eyebrows raised and said "naptime?". Guess he is getting used to his Nana's routine! .</p>
