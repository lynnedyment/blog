								<h2>A Windy Day</h2>
								<p>I heard Riku cry out at 5 a.m. today; Akane told me later he had been awake at 2 a.m. with a bad dream. She managed to get him back to sleep but I was unsuccessful; I did read and dozed a bit, but finally gave up at 6 a.m. Riku peeked 'round the corner in the tatami room at me at 6:45, as I was chatting with Bryn on IM. </p>
<p>I got off the computer immediately at Riku's request... "Come play." First a diaper change and getting dressed, although he was in no hurry for either. I don't like him eating in a soggy diaper though, so he had no choice. We played kitchen for a bit, and then he was ready for his breakfast.</p>
<p>While he ate today, I sang him lots of songs. He has started asking me to sing a song about... and then he names something, almost always starting with "a chicken!". The only one that comes to mind is "Old MacDonald Had a Farm", which is just fine with Riku. He adds more animals and sits smiling away while I make animals sounds... usually a dog, cat, and horse. However, we have an action song now, and Riku is just delighted with it. I sing Raffi's "Oh Mr, Sun, Sun, Mister Golden Sun... " and we put our arms and hands up in a big circle above our heads. At "hiding behind a tree" we cover our eyes, and we sway back and forth until we come to "come out and play with you" at which point we are supposed to point to the other person but are still working on that part... and ending with "please shine down on me" by pointing to ourselves. Riku is just loving this! </p>
<p>Another favourite song he asks for is "about nuts"... which is the one Mom taught to wee Bryn one day while sitting in the car while I went in for some groceries with Kelly... "Here we go gathering nuts in May, nuts in May, nuts in May, here we go gahering nuts in May, on a cold and frosty morning!"... Riku sings bit of this with me, so be prepared, Bryn, wth the lyrics in case he asks. We sing "Down at the station, early in the morning", with Riku finishing up by "pull the little handle, chug, chug, toot toot, off we go!", and he almost always ends it by saying "Blaunka say 'All aboard!'", and smiling. I sing "The Big Ship Sails on the alley-alley oh" (or however that is spelled!), and today did lots of nursery rhymes for the first time as well. He liked "Hickory Dickory Dock" and "Three Little Kittens" too. </p>
<p>Back to the kitchen; Riku made me "eggs", using his little plastic flipper to turn it over (Akane has a plastic fried egg for him, but he made me a very delicious imaginery one today), seasoned it with pepper, and then with more when I asked. He did use the whisk on the egg too. I guess he has his own recipe for a fried egg, as he whisked the "egg" in the bowl for quite a while, looking very professional.</p>
<p>Akane took over at 8 a.m. so I could get into the shower. I wanted to get him out fairly early today for a walk/sleep so that we could join Akane in a walk to her mom's. Unfortunately, rain was predicted, but I was willing to take the chance of getting a bit wet. We set off at 10 a.m., after Riku ate a half slice of toast, and a piece of "bacon" for a snack.</p>
<p>We had planned to meet Akane at the door downstairs at 10:30 so that we could walk with her; if Riku were asleep then I planned to just keep walking with him. However, Akane decided it wasn't worth risking getting stuck in the rain halfway to her Mom's, so she went on the bus and I headed off in the same direction. I wanted to see if I could find my way to that area by remembering which way Ayako drove us the other night. Success! I did it... found a new way to Takashamiya! I think it's faster than the way I have walked before, as I was there in just twenty-five minutes. I hung around the bus area for ten minutes hoping to see Akane, but I didn't, and continued on my walk with Riku. He slept for an hour and fifteen minutes, and I discovered a new area today, walking along some streets off the beaten track. </p>
<p>I took lots of photos of various homes this morning, as I find it quite fascinating that on the same block there can be a very old crumbling falling-down house, deserted (I think!), a tiny and badly maintained home with three layers of boards and flowerpots carefully tended to, a gorgeous modern Japanese-style home beautifully landscaped and a very North American looking boring brick apartment building.</p>
<p>I haven't had an egg salad sandwich here yet (Akane did give me half of one the first week I was here, as the second half was ham), I was hungry from having walked two hours, so talked myself into one from a bakery on the old "Shopping Road" not far from here. Riku woke just as I was eating it (of course!) and decided that yes, he would like to try it. He liked it! and ate half of it. Akane said later that he hasn't liked it up to now so his tastes are changing. When offered more though he said very nicely "No kank you."</p>
<p>Oh, while walking to "Shopping Road" we once again ran into three familiar faces... the nice mom from the playground downstairs with her two year old son in the back baby seat of her bike (we stopped and greeted each other... Riku was still napping), and at the bakery ran into the woman who runs the clothing store downstairs whom Riku always greets. I do take such pleasure in these encounters! Last night when I was downstairs on my own for an hour, I stopped in a shop I had never been in and with her grown son's help (he buys the children's clothing for this shop in NYC twice a year), she told me that she thought my grandson was very beautiful. I guess I am not hard to spot! </p>
<p>It started to rain about three minutes from home; we ran very quickly with Riku helping out by pushing himself back and forth very quickly and laughing away! I took him out of the stroller as soon as we were inside the mall so he could stretch those legs before we got home. I quickly put together his lunch for him.... two leftover dishes that Akane had made yesterday... a bowl each of rice with grated and cooked carrot and sweet potato, and a side dish of the most delicious Chinese veg' and tofu dish... eggplant, green pepper, carrots, and sweet potato. Riku ate both dishes and asked for dessert. I made up a little dish of four sliced strawberries and half a kiwi, all eaten in record time. He had eaten the rest of his toast from breakfast on his walk too, and a tiny iced cookie. We are not sure where Riku is putting all this food lately! </p>
<p>Akane arrived home as I was doing up the dishes, bearing gifts... two roses for me from her mom!, and a nice take-out container filled with the glazed sweet potatoes I have been looking forward to trying. She had bought herself a sushi plate as well, and of course Riku was right up there taking big bites of her nori-wrapped rice with salmon. He drank a big cup of veggie juice too. </p>
<p>He started to show signs of needing his nap, but just as I was tucking him in, Doug called. I had left a message for him to call earlier so it was forty-five minutes later... he was delighted to talk to his Grandpa and then to his Daddy too... although for a couple of minutes, as Bryn was saying "Hi Riku" and asking questions, I am sure that Riku thought it was Doug talking. Their voices are very similar and Riku seemed puzzled as to why he was talking to Grandpa when they had said goodbye already! </p>
<p>Unfortunately, all this excitement, and it now being an hour past the time he should have been napping, it was impossible to get him settled. I tried so hard, and several times he was "this" close but he was really resisting. I gave up, and immediatly took him outside for some fresh air and playtime. Akane was napping when we left. Riku knew it and said "Mommy sleeping. Riku not sleeping. Riku woke up!" Ha! </p>
<p>When we arrived at the playground, we were the only ones there. It was a bit damp from the earlier rain, but this made great packing sand for the "cakes" and "ice cream" balls the children made when they joined us. The twins arrived late; I had thought of my promise to meet them today; they had told Akane they would be out of school earlier today, so I thought I had probably missed them. It was already 4 p.m. They are usually out of school and at the playground at 2:15. However, at 5:15 they came bounding into the playground, shouting out "hi" from way back and waving enthusiastically. Riku had been flirting a bit with a darling one-year-old girl, who arrived just shortly after we did. The grandmother was watching Riku intently, no doubt imagining her little granddaughter doing all these things that Riku was doing, in just another year. He touched her cheek gently, said "Hi baby". wanted her to put her feet on the riding toy, and then went off to walk on the narrow ledge, balancing carefully, twisting himself into the lower three branches of a tree and holding the pose long enough for me to get my camera, and just being his generally good-natured little self. </p>
<p>He was so delighted to have Aya and Yui join him in the sandbox though! They were busy as bees making things with the pails and shovels, and Riku was delighted when three bigger boys joined in for a few minutes... really just hanging around and watching Riku. I heard them say "Americanu", and then look surprised when Riku piped up with his Japanese! The girls said "bye bye" at 5:30 but continued to wave and call out to us from their balcony across the way. </p>
<p>We left at 5:50 and Riku was just wired! He ran and laughed and opened the door with the key, raced into the hallway, was really loud! when he spotted two boys about eight and six, and when we got in the same elevator with them he touched both of them on their cheeks! I don't think this is a typical Japanese child! Akane seemed shocked that he would do such a thing, and it is surprising really. He didn't used to touch strangers so readily.</p>
<p>Akane was up when we arrived home and I told her I wanted to give Riku four-grain cereal for dinner tonight. He hasn't had a BM all day, which is very unusual, nor has he used the toilet once, despite being put on many times. It used to be when Riku was hungry he would demand "yogurt!" It hasn't happened much here as I am very aware of how important those snacks are to his general behaviour... when he's hungry he is demanding! He was up to the table the minute we came in the door.. oh, I put him on the toilet first and washed his hands... and then he called for "dessert!" We told him first comes dinner and he said "No! Dessert!" Riku was a hungry boy apparently! </p>
<p>I quickly washed some strawberries and gave him the little pick he likes to eat his fruit with. "<strong>Oh!</strong> Strawberries!" was my reward. I got the cereal cooked, added one dried apricot cut into tiny bits, dried blueberries, and more fresh strawberries, to make it as enticing as possible. This adult-sized portion was polished off; Akane and I were both surprised. I asked if he was still hungry, or if he was okay, and he said "I still hungry". Out came the second half of a kiwi from this morning and a half piece of buttered whole wheat toast. He nibbled away at that until the plate was empty. I asked if he was still hungry and he replied, "Oh, yes, I still hungry!" I suggested pudding as I hadn't eaten my second tofu pudding yet. "This pudding is yummy!" he said, as it too disappeared. While all this eating was going on, I prepared my own dinner... some sauteed spinach over rice and some peppery gluten I had brought from home. I had no longer sat down beside him (a big mistake!) when Riku said "Oh, I like that!"... and ate not only the few bites of my rice with spinach, and two little bits of the gluten, but also ate a small bowl of rice I got for him, along with some of my spinach! Akane and I just kept staring and staring at his stomach and smiling at each other. Really, where is it going?!  The final straw was my bringing in a small plate with two complete stalks of celery, cut into thirds ... for me. I should have known bettter by now! "Oh, Riku like that!" everything starts with an enthusiastic "Oh!". So I pulled off the strings on the first one, and down it went, after which he helped pull off the strings and ate three more. Akane took a photo of his very large tummy! It is round and hard and oh-so-big!</p>
<p>Riku played with his cars in the kitchen, right in the middle of the very small floor space! while I washed the dishes.</p>
<p>Tub time, hoping it would relax him enough that his bowel would empty before bedtime! No such luck; he had a great time in the tub, tried unsuccessfully once again to go to the bathroom, lay down on the nice mat his Bahbah sent home for him with Akane, while he got rubbed down with lotion and pulled on his own pj bottoms. He takes it very seriously, making sure his feet are through the bottoms before standing up. </p>
<p>As soon as he was ready (his teeth were brushed right after the tub), I said "What time is it Riku?" and his ran running to his mom saying "bedtime!" 8 p.m. Nice! Let's just hope there isn't a very big surprise for his mommy during the night! </p>
<p>It's now 10:30 p.m. and I'm off to bed... tomorrow we may be going to a museum with Ayako and out for an Italian lunch (if Riku's nap works out as we hope), and on Friday Riku is going to the dentist for the first time!</p>
