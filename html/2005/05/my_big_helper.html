								<h2>My Big Helper!</h2>
								<p>A banner day today; I was the first one awake, at 6:45 a.m.! All was quiet and, unwilling to be the one to disturb anyone (I know I should have gone in and wakened Riku with my big "good morning" smile but Akane wouldn't have appreciated it!), I sat in bed finishing up my journal for last night. I had been too tired to write in those few last details after finishing up on the computer so late. </p>
<p>I did get up and shower at 7:30 and Akane and Riku were in the kitchen; they woke up just as I was getting into the shower. What a good sleep they both had! Akane said she was awake a few times in the night, but she had such a nice early start to the night that it must have felt great. </p>
<p>Two yogurts for Riku today, one with blueberries and one with fresh strawberries. Yum! Akane often buys vanilla yogurt for him and this tastes like dessert. Once again Riku played happily on his own, down on the floor with his blocks and cars, chatting away to himself, and keeping busy. At one point he watched a short Saturday tv show for children, and then put on "A Bug's Life". Riku watched it quite intently for a bit, then I sat beside him on a chair and we talked about "what is this?" and "what is happening" and "uh oh!", retelling the story for his and my sake, I suppose. Once I went to get my breakfast Riku went back to just looking up now and then, the way his daddy watched TV at this age.</p>
<p>Akane was obviously feeling much better today, as after eating no dinner last night, she was up to a small piece of pizza and a small bowl of leftover spaghetti for breakfast. I am now trying to save the whole wheat bread for Riku, so instead of toast with peanut butter, I had a bowl of oatmeal with dried apricots and blueberries, flax seed, and wheat germ. Yum! </p>
<p>It's another gray overcast day, but we need to get out nonetheless. I asked Riku if he wanted to go to the big park or the playground and he chose the big park. I know he loves having the freedom to wander so far on his own and yet still have me in sight. We climbed the big hill again, picked up lots of rocks, threw some of them into a huge puddle. I was the stone-picker-upper and Riku said "thank you" each time I handed him one, and "Oh, big one! Thank you." for the favourite large ones. They do make a much more impressive splash after all. We looked at the statues again today but headed off into the rose garden with its diverging pathways; Riku chooses whether to take the ramps or the steps and then I go "other way" and we meet up. We were gone from 11-12:30 and I had a hungry boy on my hands when we walked in the door.</p>
<p>Riku ate yet another big helping of the cherry tomatoes we reserve for him, while waiting for his own "bacon" and egg half-sandwich and a few bites of Akane's rice. She also had some prepared potato salad, which is a very popular dish in Japan and available in small individual containers in almost every small store and in all of the supermarkets. </p>
<p>Akane's two aunts (her father's sisters) had sent her a big box filled to the brim with produce. Akane can't imagine how they thought she could possibly eat all of this food but she will share some with her mom's household. In the box were: a huge but not fresh head of broccoli, 3 eggplants, a bag of six good-sized onions, 5 potatoes, a big bag of not very fresh green peas (Akane loathes green peas and I ate a few of them raw before deciding I had better cook them), a big bag of fava beans, four lovely tomatoes, a huge cabbage, a stick of sticky yam, the biggest kabocha squash I have ever seen, 2 bunches of lovely spinach, two big carrots (they are usually sold two to a bag!), and five slender Japanese cucumbers! We now have more than enough produce to see us through to the end of my visit. </p>
<p>After lunch, I got busy shelling the peas. Riku was in the tatami room, playing with his cars, and I thought he might like to see the fresh peas in the pods. He did indeed. I started opening them and Riku would rub his finger down the middle of them to slide them into a bowl. Then I decided to have him try to open the pods. It was a bit of a challenge but he really worked away at it, until finally he was opening all of the pods, with some effort, taking out each pea, and then pulling the pods in two to pile up on the table.. I have no idea why they needed separating and Riku wasn't saying. It was the cutest thing; he stood solemnly beside my chair, working away very seriously at it, and showing much delight in the growing pile of peas in the bowl. He did try one but didn't like it; too bad they weren't young and really fresh as he  may have liked them then. I cooked them up and will use them over the next couple of days. </p>
<p>Riku spent quite a bit of time playing with his two stuffed pets on my bed, chatting away to them, covering them up, walking around with them... quite a busy little guy today. He went on to play cars and airport and I joined him after writing a huge blog and somehow deleting it, despite having "saved" after each paragraph! Argggh, it was so very frustrating, but playing parking lot at the airport really puts things in perspective. </p>
<p>At 4 p.m. we went down to our little playground. Not one child was in view when we arrived, but within minutes there were at least eight children there, ranging in age from about 2 to 10. Today was the first weekend day we have been there so it was fun to see some older children. How this changed the dynamics of the playground for Riku! Within minutes he had his own "posse"! I'm not sure why but he just became the leader and four children just ran after him, chasing the ball he threw everywhere... into the "woods", through a fence, and into the garden area. It really was funny to see. He was being very vocal, meaning that he was whooping it up and shrieking out loud; I have never heard him be so loud before. The other very amusing thing was that Riku would run deliberately into a not-huge puddle there (I had rolled up his pants when we first arrived) and it was obvious that not one of the children would do such a thing. Every time that Riku did it, they would all laugh a little nervously, which of course made Riku run through again and again. </p>
<p>For part of the early time there, I was reading on the bench. Two little girls came up and said "hi", and spoke a little Japanese to me. It became obvious to them that I didn't understand them, but they came in a little closer, standing within a couple of inches from me, obviously interested in what I was reading. I pointed out the word "I' to them, said it and then pointed to myself. They did the same. Very good! I found the work "you" next and did the same in reverse... and so did they. </p>
<p>At one point, they were with Riku alone in another area, and I was standing nearby just watching them. Somehow it was obvious they wanted me to talk to them, so I sang "head and shoulders, knees and toes" and that was a hit! I sang it about six times, and Riku was saying "more" each time, which meant that they too were saying "more" when it finished. They were very pleased with themselves, as well they should  have been! </p>
<p>A couple of the boys were near the bench as well and we all sang "ABC" together. They had a skipping rope with them and were showing me how well they skipped. I took a turn too, which they thought was very funny, and managed to get up to twenty after a couple of bad starts... cluncky sandals and close to fifty years without practice is my excuse. They clapped for me, as I did for them. One boy, about seven or eight, was a master skipper! He could twist the ropes as he jumped, and he jumped really well and high. Akane told me later that they jump rope in exercise class; what a great idea. I don't know if children jump rope at home anymore. </p>
<p>One sad thing happened to Riku there today though; a young boy kicked Riku very hard and made him cry. The child had already poured sand over one boy, and hit another and made both of them cry. I think he thought Riku was going to take the tricycle away from him so he hit him really hard in the knee area. Tears just poured from Riku; he was shuddering, and upset that anyone could do such a thing. The child's mother gave him a good scolding but of course she should have just taken him out of the playground after the second, if not the first, incident. The time there ended happily though, with time in the sandbox, playing with the bigger girls. </p>
<p>Akane thought she might join us at 5:30 to go to the grocery store; we waited until 5:45 but it was getting cold and we left. Riku did his usual swell job with the front door key, and just as he had pushed the number 29 on the elevator, Akane stepped out. We all went to the store together, Riku retelling the "boy hit Riku, Riku cry, boy mommy angry, boy cry" story many times. He was pretty restless in the store, not staying with me, and losing his baggie of beloved rocks, so we left Akane to buy the tomatoes and bananas, and came upstairs to start dinner. Riku's... tomatoes for a starter, the rest of his French toast, carefully eaten with the saved pick from my sandwich yesterday, and big bites of Akane's sushi roll... "What is this?" when biting into the large long piece of squid in the center of it and then "scary" when Akane told him; he was having none of it, spit it into his bib holder, and wanted it out of there fast! Didn't blame him a bit actually; it did look quite disgusting! He had more tomatoes, a few apple slices and a banana. </p>
<p>Tired boy by this time so into the sink/tub routine we went. He was so relaxed and so ready for bed at the end of it all; he always wants his mom to tuck him in, but Akane was not feeling well at all, shivery and ill; she said Riku could sleep with me. I was expecting a fuss from Riku, as it's the first time I have ever slept with him, but he accepted his fate very nicely, allowed me to read "Small Pig" to him, and was asleep in minutes, at 8:45. </p>
<p>I wrote in my blog, did the dishes, tidied the table, admired my flowers, and went to sleep at 11:30, moving Riku over to his own side of the bed!</p>
