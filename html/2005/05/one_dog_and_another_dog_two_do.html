								<h2>One Dog and Another Dog... Two Dogs!</h2>
								<p>I was awakened this morning by a knock on my door, and a big greeting from Riku... "Lunch time, lunch time!"  It wasn't really quite that late; in fact, it was 7 a.m.! He had wakened at 6 a.m. after a very good sleep, said Akane, and I guess he was in the mood for cooking. I had "cake". on one plate, with a fork, "melon" on another, with a spoon, and then a "hot cuppa tea". It was all delicious, of course, and just what I needed to start my day.  My bed looked like a buffet table by the time Riku finsished with all his preparations. </p>
<p>Akane is spending the day with Ayako today; they are meeting here at 11:30, so I decided that Riku and I would head out early so he could nap in his stroller and not with his mom. Not only would it give her some time alone to shower and get ready, but she was doing a load of laundry for me too. It was gray and overcast, so we came back for our raincoats. Good thing, too, as it did strart to sprinkle later on and I used Riku's raincoat as a blanket for his legs and body. </p>
<p>As always, Riku wanted to walk for a while, and so we strolled along, stopping every once in a while for Riku to explore something that had caught his eye. Today I was sitting on a low wall separating a little garden area from the sidewalk. Riku was very intent on watching the top of the wall. I went over to find three tiny ants walking along, being busy. Riku was entranced and pointed to the garden area saying "big one in there!" Not sure what that big something was, but it was gone when I got there. Riku reached out to touch one ant, spinning it around and making it head off in the opposite direction, a second one was sent on to its next life, and the third one happily survived intact! </p>
<p>About ten minutes further along, Riku was ready for another snack, so into the stroller he went, happy with his container of brown rice biscuits, two tiny pretzels, and a few cheddar bunnies. Ten minutes later he was fast asleep. I walked quickly on to Diamond City, the big mall we went to a couple of days ago. I wanted to walk around and check out all the stores and the timing was perfect, as Riku would be asleep for at least an hour. </p>
<p>I headed first for the huge food floor as they are one of the places I most like to wander around in. Usually the entire bottom floor of a department store is a beehive of food activity... food vendors calling out their products, lots of free samples, food being prepared and served up to eat there or take out (before I leave here I will buy some of the most wonderful-looking baked and glazed sweet potatoes), and movies of products being prepared as you move along each section (which means it can be pretty darned loud in there!). </p>
<p>I wanted to buy a rice bowl for Riku and asked a young woman if she could help me; she said she had "no English" but would call her husband who did; he was at the end of a very long aisle and she called him on her cell phone! He was ever so helpful and found the salmon rice bowl for Riku's lunch that I wanted. Normally I would have taken food along with me, but hadn't planned to be there over the lunch hour. Riku was still sleeping so on I went. I was looking for an egg salad sandwich on whole wheat bread, but could only see white at this particular place. I decided to look elsewhere. </p>
<p>On the way out of the store, though, right in the corner, was their French bakery, very common in both Sakai City and Osaka as well... and maybe throughout Japan. I really should have waited to look until after lunch, but instead gave in to my curiousity about various and luscious-looking goodies. I bought a French pastry coronet filled with custard, two mochi balls (they look just like Tim Horton's tidbits) but are filled with various goodies... I bought one custard cream and one cream cheese. And a small "butter bun" had my name on it, and then I felt I should have something a little healthier and bought a walnut and raisin bun made with grainier bread. </p>
<p>Riku woke up in the mall, sat up, pointed upstairs and said "toys up there!" and he was right! "Riku go there?" I told him we would as soon as we ate and being the reasonable child that he is, he said "ok" and we sat to eat. His mom and dad would not have been proud of the way I wrapped the nori sheet around his sticky salmon-filled rice triangle, but it worked and Riku enjoyed it anyway. He ate all of it before we got home but not all in one sitting. Of course I was very hungry by this time, and so started to nibble away at my little bag of goodies. First the custard coronet (Riku helped me with the custard), and then the two mochi balls (I would only buy the custard ones in the future), and then the butter bun. I did have the will power to save the walnut/raisin bun for the trip home! </p>
<p>Riku had a grand time in the playroom. It wasn't busy, and so he had immediate access to all of his favourite things there... the dollhouse and furniture, the board with the marbles spinning down, but mostly the waterworks set, with no water, but endless possibilities with slides, gates, ramps, and a water pump. He wasn't too thrilled when anyone else wanted in on the action. At one point he walked over to the musical instruments next to it and handed one child the drum sticks! </p>
<p>The heavy rain had stopped by the time we left, and much to my surprise Riku did not nap on the way home. I was tired and ready for me tea, so asked Riku if he would like to nap in the stroller or at home. He chose a nap at home. He had dozed a little but still needs more sleep to get him through to the end of his day. I am trying to give Riku lots of choices right now... "Would you like strawberries or grapes?", "Would you like to go down the ramp or the stairs?" (this is particularly helpful when he doesn't want to go back home at all right then!), "Would you like to sleep in Nana's bed or Mommy's bed?", which I asked when we got home. He chose my bed, and I told him that I did not want him to cry, that he was to have a little nap and when he woke up we would go to the park. "OK", he said. And much to my surprise he settled down, with just a bit of head stroking on my part, and was asleep within ten minutes easily. </p>
<p>I so enjoyed my tea... even without a bickie!, and then got to work anwering emails; I am so far behind and don't really expect to catch up. Riku slept for an hour and fifteen minutes, which was perfect, as it was a later than usual afternoon nap. As soon as he woke we sat side by side and watched a little of the "ABC" children's show he likes so much; it is really cute and well done. I prepared dinner for both of us... leftover half a potato for me, cooked up in a scramble with an egg and the spinach we are trying to use up, from Akane's aunts. I also finished up a small bowl of edamame beans, and a few pickled carrots and cucumber from the other night. Riku ate a very good dinner of leftover pasta with veggies, the other half of his banana, and some toast. </p>
<p>We left the house at 6 p.m. to go to the park. At the corner, across from the park, Riku always pushes the button for the walk signal and it plays "When a body meets a body, coming through the rye". I wish I could remember the rest of the words, as Mom used to sing that song! Riku likes me to sing it too, and always says "Oh, singing!" when the music starts. As we reached the middle of the road I noticed a huge full and gorgeous sun just hanging there! I pointed it out to Riku and we stopped on the other side to get a really good look at it. It was beautiful indeed and I hope the photo I took of it turns out. </p>
<p>We were the only ones there, which was perfect; because of his snifflies I didn't want to take him to the playground, where there were bound to be other children running around. He collected rocks and added them to his collection that he keeps there, and at one point a man walked by with his dog. "Oh, a dog!" piped up Riku and then spotted another one on the other side of us, "Oh, and another dog! Two dogs!" </p>
<p>We stayed until it was dark enough that some of the neon lights were coming on, and then went to the grocery store for milk and tofu squares. Much to our surprise, Akane was home! She and Riku were delighted to see each other; Riku did sit down immediately, though, to take off his own shoes and socks and stuff the socks in his shoes the way that Akane tells me Bryn does with Riku's socks! The other night Akane took off one of Riku's shoes without thinking and he was not pleased. She also put away some of his toys last night while he was bathing and he told her, "No put away Riku's toys!" in quite the little tone... she apologized and said he could put away his kitchen things insted. "OK", says Riku, and was pacified. </p>
<p>Ayako had plans to see Masu, so we all sat down at the table together, while Riku drew and had another snack. Seem all he does is eat? Well, he does eat a lot... and stops when he has had enough. He had a few bites of his mom's rice bowl, a bowl of "ice cream"... the cutest little balls of sorbet I have seen, which Akane cuts in halves and puts in a lovely little glass meant for sake. A few strawberries on a side dish and we had a happy boy. He drew for half an hour as well, now telling us what he is drawing as he goes. I spotted a great little drawing which looked just like a perfect fish to me, and asked Riku "What is this?". His answer... "Oh, that is a fish!" and he was as pleased as punch that he had drawn it! </p>
<p>Continuing along with this independent phase, Riku took all of his clothes off by himself, with just a little help with the snug shirt. He would like to undo buttons too, but most of his are pretty tiny, so we will have to find some big buttoned clothing for him! Off came the overalls, then the diaper, and then onto the toilet... and yes, he was once again successful at urinating in the toilet! I just wish the whole process lasted longer as I would love to have a photo of that face all lit up with his pride! It is just adorable, and his mom and I were so happy for him. </p>
<p>Bath time... our usual fun time as Riku loves to find out all the different sounds he can make with his various tub containers. Because he is standing up, he has lots of pushing power, and can get the big basins and the little watering cans filled with water and push them to the bottom. He knows the plastic glass stays down and he then tries to catch it with his foot, and that the watering can will go all the way down and then float up to the top on its own. The big thrill last night was making a big blub blub sound with the glass turned upside down. We were both laughing out loud as each time he did it it was like it was the first time ever. </p>
<p>Riku is always so relaxed and ready for bed after he gets his lotion rubbed on and changed into a diaper and t-shirt for bedtime. I read him "Small Pig" and his mommy took him off to bed at 8:35 p.m., hoping he would be sound asleep by 9 p.m. There was a TV show she wanted to watch then, a competition between the cities of Osaka and Hiroshima, with chefs competing as to who made the best okonomiyaki, a thick pancake-looking dish consisting of egg, green onion, flour, sticky yam, cabbage, kombu, and bonito flakes, with meat or seafood added as well. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Riku didn't sleep, as he had a BM, and was up getting changed at 9 p.m. Akane tried hard to get him to sleep but gave up; I knew how much she wanted to watch the show so I took over and settled him. He was more than ready, and knows that his Nana does not fool around! </p>
<p>I came out and worked on my blog for an hour and a half, only to lose all but the first and last paragraphs of it at 11 p.m.! </p>
<p>Ah yes, the competition... Hiroshima won, much to Akane's chagrin, but it was due to their having access to some very special fish (eel perhaps) that is not available anywhere else. Her cousin had called mid-program, so Akane chatted with her for a while after the show. We both went to bed too late... 11:30 p.m</p>
<p>Some last notes:</p>
<p>...Today Riku stepped into the dining room area, looked at his play area, and announced "These are Riku's toys". </p>
<p>... when I called Riku for his snack yesterday he said "I'm busy working."</p>
<p>... when Akane sneezes, Riku is right there saying "Bless you."</p>
<p>... and yesterday, for the first time, I heard Riku call Akane "Okasa"... "mommy" in Japanese. I had only heard him use the English term, but Akane says he has said it before... just not often. Very sweet.</p>
