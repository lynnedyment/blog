								<h2>Such a Pretty Boy</h2>
								<p>Riku awoke at 5:30 this morning, too early at any time but especially when his cold is worse and he could have used the sleep. So could his mom; Akane said he was awake several times in the night with his stuffy nose; poor wee guy, which meant that she was awake too. Now she has his cold and is feeling tough herself. </p>
<p>I must have dozed off for another half hour after hearing him and then got up to see how he was doing. He still wanted his yogurt, but didn't finish it all at one sitting as usual, though he did finish it and a banana a little later on. </p>
<p>He and I were out the door at 9:20 a.m. for what I hoped would be a long nap. Riku wanted to walk first, though, and so he did, for half an hour. We had only just crossed the road from the apartment building and started walking, when three Japanese people, a man in his mid-forties and two young women in their twenties, walked right up to Riku and started chatting to him, and to me. They thought he was the cutest child they had seen... no, they thought he was the prettiest child they had seen! They got right down to his level, asked him his name, wanted to know how old he was, where we were from, and were just so sweet with both of us. What a lovely encounter! They were still waving goodbye half way down the street with Riku waving back assuring them "see you later!"</p>
<p>We just strolled on our way down a quiet side street, with Riku finding the odd not-to-be-passed-by rock, and sticking his head into doorways in case there was something to see. A half hour later he raised his arms up, into the stroller he went, and in less than five minutes he was asleep. </p>
<p>I had decided to walk back to where we were yesterday, as Akane had told me about a wonderful German toy department, with toys out for the children to play with as well. It was in this very same place we passed yesterday; Akane had said we would go there by bus one day so this worked out well. We had a destination in mind for today then, unusual for me as I generally just walk, trying to keep those twin towers within sight. </p>
<p>However, before going to the store (and with Riku still sleeping) I got side-tracked by a hair salon I had noticed yesterday. My hair has been terrible since arriving; it wasn't cut well or short enough on my last cut in SF, and with the heat and high humidity here, no matter how I dry it or which products I use, it has been frizzy and not easy to deal with. This particular place seemed to have fairly young stylists which I thought was good as they may have been more recently trained and possibly would have worked on Caucasion hair too. Akane had suggested last week that I ask a Caucasion woman where she went, but I have only seen two this whole trip and they were both in Osaka. </p>
<p>Riku slept off in a quiet corner for another forty minutes and I had my hair washed and my haircut almost finished when he woke. At this point I was quite happy with my hair; he had cut it the length I wanted but then kept working away at it with various types of scissors. At this point it was too late to holler "enough!" as he obviously had to finish what he had started.... but it did seem to go on and on. I was afraid I was going to end up with some of those long thin strands hanging on my neck, but that didn't happen, thank goodness. Bottom line is my hair is much shorter than I wanted it to be. This length does not suit me, but I know I shall be grateful while I'm here that at least it is a good cut and was well done. I would rather it not have been this short for Taryn's wedding but it will grow a bit in the next two weeks and two days! </p>
<p>The best part of it all (aside from the little back massage I received at the end of the cut), was the attention that Riku received from the one female staff member, and one male to a lesser extent as well. I got up to give Riku his water, and then this very friendly gal spent the rest of my hair hair cut time down on her haunches playing with Riku, and with the cars and some plastic people figures. He was in his glory, chatting away in Japanese to her and smiling that Riku smile at her. The fellow who cut my hair spoke a bit of English and said to me "He is very pretty". I agreed and said that he was a boy, just in case he thought Riku was a girl, but he nodded yes, and said that girls were pretty, but this boy was also very pretty and had beautiful eyes. It's hard to disagree! </p>
<p>The toy department in one of the big stores in this complex (I'm going back one day!) was a child's wonderland! They had so many toys out for the children to play with... a huge wooden climbing structure, with a slide, and lots of peekholes, a big table of water toys with bridges and boats (but no water), a big wooden structure filled with wooden balls (not as much fun as plastic ones though, I bet, as they would hurt if anyone got rambunctious!), a table with a wooden spiral and marbles to spin on down from the top (Riku really liked this one), a wooden doll house that also caught his attention, and a table at the back with building units... blocks, pieces that snapped together, etc. Riku was a happy boy wandering around and I had to promise that we would go back another day. We had to be back in time for his lunch at 12:30 as he had eaten such an early breakfast. Snacks are fine and he nibbled on some toast and the rice biscuits, but I knew he would be ready for his proper lunch. </p>
<p>It was only a thirty minute walk, with an extra five minutes thrown in to find my way around the train tracks. Akane wasn't feeling well, so hadn't prepared his lunch yet; he immediately asked for yogurt! ... his way of saying he wants food <strong>now</strong>. I put out some cherry tomatoes, and in less than five minutes Akane had an egg and spinach dish ready for him. He ate all but one bite, had a big bowl of strawberries, some of the vegetable drink, and all was well with his world. </p>
<p>Nap time with his mommy followed immediately; he does try to play a bit but it was already 1:30 and time for that nap. They both slept for two hours which was great; I had time for a quiet lunch (pepper "chicken" pieces I had brought from home, some rice mixed with whole grains (which Akane's dad is now using to help control his diabetes; Akane bought some to try here and we all like it), and a nice big serving of quickly cooked spinach thrown on top of it all. Yum! Fast and delicious, and good for me too. A cup of nice hot milky tea followed, while I read yet another of the New Yorker fiction pieces I had pulled out to read "one day" and now those days are here. It's very handy as I brought fewer books with me on this trip, and can leave the best of the fiction here for Bryn to read later. Akane has read a couple of them as well. </p>
<p>By this time I was feeling mighty dozy, and if I had been a napper I would have been asleep in minutes; it was awfully tempting, and was yesterday too, but I know if Riku had awakened in ten minutes I would have felt worse for the bit of sleep; I also know, from the few times I have tried napping, that I never feel better. Give me seven or eight hours... not one! </p>
<p>I just had to move and managed to get a few emails read and written before a little boy peeked in to see what I was doing. The nose was dripping and he was pretty warm too; not a high fever but not normal either... the ears weren't red, and the cheeks weren't either but his forehead was warm as were his chest and legs. I asked if he wanted to go to the park (no playground with all the other children with this nose running) and much to my surprise he said "no", in a wan little voice. "TV?" Sure... he just needs some quiet sit down time, with his mom on one chair and me on the other side of him, exclaiming over the antics of the characters of the show we saw yesterday. This fifteen-minute piece was followed by another show with very charming young twenty-something hosts... very cute, very talented, and with lots of fun animation, skits, and songs involving very young children... two and up. We all enjoyed this time and Riku snacked on fresh oranges, some cashews, and toast while he watched it.</p>
<p>As soon as that show was over, I asked again if he wanted to go to the park for some fresh air... Akane too. She hasn't felt well all day but I thought getting out couldn't make her feel any worse. So off we all went, just strolling around the park, with Riku collecting... rocks! and finding interesting places to put them. Today he discovered a little hole and that took up twenty minutes of finding rocks the right size to put in it. Life is busy when you're two! </p>
<p>I meant to mention this the other day, but Riku for some reason will not go down the slide here. He did the first three days, I believe, and then just refused. He climbs up, stands in the middle part for a few minutes and then starts the climb down. There isn't a lot of room up there, and it's quite steep so I make sure I am very close by... right at the bottom of the slide with one foot up and braced! He has a little trouble turning around in that space and so is tempted to come down face front, but that would just be too dangerous. He has it down pat now; it takes some maneuvering but he does it, and then climbs down saying this mantra, over and over "It's okay, don't worry"... another step, finding new places for his hands and "It's okay, don't worry" once again. It is the funniest thing to hear and I'm sure it is exactly what I said to him the first few times he climbed down. </p>
<p>Akane hasn't been over here with Riku, and so he got to demonstrate how he can lift his feet off the ground while hanging from the parallel bar. He really hung on tonight and swung back and forth three times, his best effort yet! He realized today that he could do a mini version of this just outside the apartment door while waiting for us, but it's really such a short little bar that he doesn't get much lift. </p>
<p>Akane's tummy was upset, so she went off to the store to buy a rice bowl, and when she came back got to see Riku climbing up the slide faster than he ever has! Two children were playing on it and really moving and I guess he figured if that was how it was done then he had better get moving, and move he did... it was almost scary, although he is a cautious boy, thank goodness, for my sake! </p>
<p>Riku spotted his mom's food and helped her out with it; it was rice wrapped around salmon bits, and then wrapped in seaweed. He polished off the rest of it while we admired the roses; nice to see that his appetite is still healthy! </p>
<p>Home at 6:30 after stopping at the bakery; Akane bought some pizza for herself, a white bun with Camembert cheese baked in it for me, and a Danish roll for Riku. We knew he was hungry when he went back for the fourth free sample of bread cubes! At home he ate a bowl of porridge with cranberries, blueberries, flax, and wheat germ. Finished every bite of it, and said "yes, please", he would like some "ice cream" but it was really sorbet... two helpings of that! And all the while his nose was running and his eyes look tired... poor little baboo. </p>
<p>Tub time, and lots of fun there, as we had a little frog hand cloth gobbling up hair bands and having BMs in the pails and in the water. Oh my! He really loves his bath, and he needed to relax and be ready for sleep, which he was at 8:30 tonight. I know his mommy would have liked me to tuck him in tonight, but Riku will have nothing of this at all. "Mommy tuck in, okay?" and when I assure him that yes, his mommy will tuck him in, he says "okay, mommy tuck in... night night, see you in the morning!" and off they went. </p>
<p>And I'm off to bed too... I really love being in bed by 10 p.m. reading and it's not going to happen tonight. I am, however, washed with teeth brushed so that is a bonus. I just have to do up the dinner dishes... yuck! Have never left them so late. Oh, that reminds me... Riku was playing in his kitchen for a bit tonight and brought over my "dinner" on a plate with a fork. When I told him I was finished and that it had been delicious, he took it away and said "Now I have to wash dishes in sink" and he did... put the plate and fork in his own little sink, pretended to turn on the water tap making the whooshing sound, and washed away. It was the first time I have seen him do that... very cute. </p>
<p>Must remember to tell you tomorrow about a group of four young children we met on our way to the park tonight... as I really am too tired to write another paragraph! I think the lack of hair has done something to my brain... it's short! Night night... </p>
<p>Hey! I just had a whole conversation in English with Ayako and she understood every word. I told her Akane was sleeping (snore), that she and Riku had colds (snort, sniff), and that yes, she and Akane were going out tomorrow... and she told me in the morning... I told her to call Akane then... not bad! It took a lot more explaining to tell Ayako that Akane was in labour! and that was in person! My Japanese hasn't improved, so it shows you how well Ayako's English has...</p>
