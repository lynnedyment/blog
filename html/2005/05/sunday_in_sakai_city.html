								<h2>Sunday in Sakai City</h2>
								<p>This day started early, very early! I awoke at 3 a.m. but thanks to my little flashlight, I read for fifteen minutes and managed to get back to sleep, though only until 5:30 when Riku awoke! While Akane went to the bathroom, Riku decided to join me in my room. He was all ready for a story. "Small Pig" was his first choice and he looked at every single page so very carefully. At 6 a.m. he fell asleep holding the book, and slept for an extra half hour... not quite long enough for me, nor for him as he was fretful and not quite knowing what to do with himself. I held him, rocked him, told him about his room at our house with all his animals, books, the picture of the dreaming boy, etc. which was enough to distract him and make him grin up at me, ready to get on with his day. </p>
<p>6:50 found us in the kitchen, Riku sitting at the table "drawing?" while I made him oatmeal with flax seed, wheat germ, and blueberries. He ate every bite of it, in between drawings... starting with the yellow pencil and then when finished carefully putting each pencil back in its slot. Riku likes them all pointing the same way after using them, and none of them rolled over on top of another. It amazes me to see how meticulous he is. </p>
<p>Akane woke about 7:20 and joined us at the table to eat her BLC... cucumber instead of tomato today. While I hung up my clothes, Riku sat on my futon and looked at the rest of the books I brought, and discovered my flashlight which kept him very busy for at least twenty minutes. We even went into a couple of dark closets to really check it out; he loved it! </p>
<p>I went in to shower, and was very impressed with the service... Riku knocked at the door and had brought me my slippers! By the time I had finished showering and drying my hair, I realized that all was quiet.... Riku and Akane in bed for a nap. It was 8:40 and I knew there was no way my body was going to fall asleep. I sat and read quietly in the dining room, drinking hot water and relaxing. Akane came out an hour later; Riku slept for two and a half hours! </p>
<p>After a snack of raisin toast and orange juice, Riku and I left the apartment for some outdoor play time, but it was drizzling too hard and we ended up walking around the mall downstairs instead. He's completely fascinated with flora and fauna and inspected all the plants thoroughly, catching the attention of a couple of clerks who came over to say hello. </p>
<p>We were gone from noon until 1 a.m. and walked in to the smell of something very delicious cooking; Akane had a hot lunch almost ready for us... a wonderful tofu dish (my very favourite food of all!), with cabbage and Japanese bell pepper, another dish of Japanese cucumber and mekabu, an okra-like vegetable, rice, and a dish of scrambled eggs. Riku ate lots of egg, some tofu, and a little rice.</p>
<p>We played in the apartment after lunch (still raining), keeping busy building towers, drawing, and looking at all the animals on the memory cards I brought with me. At 3 p.m. "Buba", Riku's other grandmother stopped in for an unexpected visit, bringing for Riku a set of sand toys, a small red Elmo, and a beautifully cloth-wrapped dish for us for dinner!  </p>
<p>Riku was showing signs of being a tired boy, so at 4 p.m. I took him off to my room for a nap. He settled in quickly and was soon fast asleep, waking after an hour, fussing just a bit before rolling over and falling asleep again for a full hour and a half nap. Akane was sure it must have been the dreary, heavy weather, as we were both surprised. </p>
<p>After a snack of "more raisin toast?" and a few cashews we all left to do a little grocery shopping together downstairs... a huge grocery store and very handy. Riku is quite the little shopper, wanting to touch and admire all the little bottles and cans, but being very careful to put them back where they were. He also puts his hands behind his back like his Grandpa when told he can't touch the more fragile items. </p>
<p>While Akane came back with the groceries, Riku and I set out for our delayed walk, both in rain jackets, to find that the weather had cleared and that it was very pleasant, dry, and mild outside. We walked along a long and quite narrow road (I remember walking along this road while Akane was having labour pains and stopping long enough to breathe through it and continue on with Bryn and me) called "Shopping Road". It's often busy with cars and bikes but not so tonight. Riku was so happy to walk along and stop to splash in every single puddle he came across; there were dozens of them! He did take some time out to throw some rocks into an empty lot but the puddles were the main attraction. Before heading home, we walked to and through the big park again, with Riku finding enough puddles there to keep him happy too.</p>
<p>Lovely to have dinner all cooked up for us. Akane and I thoroughly enjoyed her mom's dish of mixed grains, bamboo, scrambled egg, shitake mushrooms and finely shredded carrot. Riku didn't eat much of it but ate some leftover tempura squash, a bit of egg, then a small container of yogurt, followed by a fruit plate with strawberries, grapes, and thinly sliced apples... a hit! </p>
<p>I did the dishes up, stood Riku in the bathroom sink to freshen him up a bit, put him on the toilet for the second time (forgot to mention this yesterday), and brushed his teeth. Akane went in to bed with him at 10:15 but Riku had a hard time settling down; he was still awake at 11:30(!), due it turned out, to a rare late-night BM... all that food today, no doubt! Akane had no idea what was going on with him; he would start to settle and then rouse himself again. I was in bed trying to sleep but not having much luck either; light finally out at midnight.</p>
<p>p.s. Riku counted to eight today; this is new to me, but he likes to count now and puts his fingers on the right objects as he moves along counting them. Wow!</p>
