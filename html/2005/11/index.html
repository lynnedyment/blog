								<h2><a href="/2005/11/caterpiller_power.html">Caterpiller Power!</a></h2>
								<p>Celeste and Melinda had just left when I came downstairs at 7:30 this morning and Doug left fifteen minutes later. I answered a few emails, sorted through some gifts in the cedar chest, and had time to read the paper and eat before Riku arrived at 9 a.m. Bryn said he was a sick boy, and he was... coughing and sniffly and pale. Later in the morning he was running a slight fever too. Before that though he sat and played with playdo at the table, ate a little toast and "bacon", drank a small glass of juice and was ready for a wee nap at 10:30. He slept for only forty-five minutes which was fine, as I would rather he had a longer nap in the afternoon. </p>
<p>Doug and I decided to give Riku one of his big birthday gifts early, as he is leaving for Japan just two days later. The big truck we had picked out for him was a huge hit! It took he and I quite a long time to get it separated from the packaging, and so he pretended we were "workers" and we were "working hard" at it all. We really were! I had to find a screw driver as there were screws holding down the wheels, as well as lots of plastic wiring holding the front end down onto cardboard. </p>
<p>The next hour was spent with this very loud machine, working away in the kitchen. It backs up, runs forward, has gears to dump the back end and bring it up again, there is music, the truck vibrates, it reminds you to wear your hard hat! and the thing Riku loves best, I think, is when the right button pushed comes out with "caterpiller power!" He says it every time with lots of emphasis on the "power". This was a great gift for him and Bryn got a big kick out of it too, when he came to pick Riku up at 6:15. In fact, he realized I hadn't released the wheels and we actually saw it moving backwards and foreward. </p>
<p>We had a little quiet tv time, a rare event for us; this might have been our second time watching tv ever together here! I put on my children's tape from Hawaii; Riku kept asking me for the "polar bear" and I have no idea what he meant. I asked Bryn and he didn't know either so my guess it is something that he sees at home with Akane. Riku liked the whale and the owl on the kekei tape, and I certainly enjoyed watching it again. Bryn and Caillie were crazy about this tape when they were younger and it brought back lots of good memories. </p>
<p>Susan called and I had a little chat with Amelia, who was going to a swim session this afternoon, and told me she had gone on the trapeze yesterday. She asked if Riku was napping and I told her he was sick; she asked twice more about him. We were hoping to have some playground time together today but Riku needs to stay put and not expend a lot of energy. Amelia sounded so sweet and it was lovely to hear her little voice. </p>
<p>Riku had a nice long nap in the early afternoon after eating a good-size portion of a homemade noodle soup with lots of vegies in it. He woke at an hour and twenty minutes, I asked him if he was ready to get up or if he would like to sleep a little big more. His answer "I would like to sleep a little bit more", he rolled over, pulled his cotton blanket up around him, and was asleep for another forty minutes. </p>
<p>He ate some more soup, and we went upstairs to read some books, sitting together on the bed. He was pretty warm still, his hands so hot, and he was happy to snuggle up and read all about jelly fish, a book from Kelly. He perked up after that, and Bryn found us upstairs, sitting on the floor with the truck and the blocks, filling it up and dumping it over and over. </p>
<p>They left at 6:30, Celeste and Melinda arrived home at 6:45, and Doug a half hour later. We had quite an adventure trying to go out for dinner, Celeste's and Melinda's treat. We set off to Luna, an upscale Mexican restaurant Doug and Dave ate at last week; Doug had raved about it, and Celeste and Melinda decided we should try it too. After driving downtown, we found out it was closed for a private party. Off to the outer Mission to go to "Mom is Cookin'" and found the sign gone and the restaurant closed completely! We've been going there for twenty years and it is gone! Back to the Mission District for a burrito at La Papalote.. it was fine, but just... too salty and with an uninteresting marinated tofu. </p>
<p>Doug booked me for my up-coming almost-two month trip. I fly from here on the 29th of November for a flight to Osaka, leave there (hopefully with Mieri Elizabeth having made an early arrival!), on the 20th of December, and flying back to SF on January the 17th.  </p>
<p>Raining tonight... first serious rain of the season. </p>
<p>Bed at 11:30...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/11/the_end_of_another_week_alread.html">The End of Another Week... Already!</a></h2>
								<p>I have no idea where the days went to this week, but fly by they did! I asked if I could have Riku today; he wasn't feeling up to par yesterday and I quite enjoy having the time with him at home, after all the half-days at nursery school. He will be off to Japan in less than two weeks, so the more time with him now, the better. </p>
<p>This may have been the first day ever that Riku did not "work" at his table in the kitchen, drawing and "writing" letters. Instead he chose the blue Play-doh, asking <strong>me</strong> to make a jellyfish! He seemed quite pleased with it and didn't break it up quite as quickly as he usually does, a good sign! Maybe he liked it! </p>
<p>He wanted to "throw the ball!" again today, so we went in the hallway, he sat on the bottom step while we rolled it back and forth. We do try to make him repeat wee Bryn's famous-in-the-fmaily phrase "this is not a bouncing ball, this is a rolling ball" but so far no luck! Yesterday he would put his hands up to his head the second I released the ball and I had him cupping his hands for it. Today we perfected it, as he didn't cover his head once! Just for fun, I covered mine and he said "No Nana, not do it like that!". Fast learner... and teacher too! </p>
<p>While I got him a little snack ready he went in to play catch with Grandpa. It was hilarious; Riku was laughing so hard as Doug pretended the ball was down his front, and would then put it down Riku's overalls too. Soon Riku was putting it down the front of Doug's robe, and laughing that wonderful delighted laugh as Doug pretended to search for it, finally letting it drop from his robe onto the floor. I managed to get this on video tape. </p>
<p>Riku was not coughing a lot, but when he did, it was a hard and nagging cough. I worry about pneumonia coming back, as I know it's likely to return once you have had it. </p>
<p>This was the second day I set the timer for Riku to warn him of his naptime. Today he asked for it! He said "put timer on; when it goes ring ring ring, it is naptime." My word, this is easy! I used to just tell him "ten more minutes", but it was easy to let it slide longer or forget when the time was up. He only slept an hour, which was fine, as I thought he would more easily get to sleep this afternoon, but it didn't happen and I should have encouraged him to stay in bed longer this morning... </p>
<p>He ate well, though, and did lots of juice and water drinking, so perhaps this flu/cold whatever will disappear quickly. We read some stories in the living room, working our way through some of the classics... "Little Red Riding Hood", "The Three Little Pigs" and the story of the runaway gingerbread man. These are in a Spanish language book, but it's easy enough to follow the stories with the great illustrations they have. </p>
<p>He had trouble breathing when lying down for his nap this afternoon, so I decided to put him in the stroller, hoping the fresh air would help him drift off. It didn't, but we walked for an hour, and he lay back commenting occasionally on what he was seeing. He was at least relaxing and having some quiet time, and I had a little walk too. Just on the off chance that Akane might be home, I rang their bell, and much to my surprise she was there! It was 5 p.m. and Riku went off upstairs with his mommy. </p>
<p>Doug and I were babysitting Amelia tonight, while Susan and Kevin went off to a movie, so we left the house at 6:20. Amelia was just delightful. Happy to see us after her first not-sure reaction, and then sat on the floor chatting, while building with Riku's blocks. She was a happy little camper, and it was such fun being with her. Doug and I sang a little made-up song about spiders crawling on first me, until she realized it was all in fun, and then on her! Before her bath at 7:30 she ate a container of yogurt and we shared some chips and guacamole too. </p>
<p>Of course I love bathtime with the children; Amelia was amazing as she puts her head way back in the water and stayed like that, telling me how strong she was, until I took a photo of her. She <strong>is</strong> strong! But she is gentle too, and bathed her little water baby, washing her hair, carefully keeping the water out of the baby's eyes. </p>
<p>Amelia loves getting lotion on her, and I laugh when I think about her turning over, butt in the air, so that I can put it on her back, and then flopping over to get her tummy taken care of too. She just lays back and enjoys the experience, lifting one arm and one leg at a time for the cream. She is going to love massages one day, just like her Mom and her Nana! Caillie is very much like this too, and was from the time she was a little girl like Amelia. </p>
<p>PJs, teeth brushed, three stories, and then Amelia told me it was bedtime! She put her head down, closed her eyes, and listened to me singing to her, while stroking her forehead. Minutes later she was gently snoring away. Ahh, that was easy, I thought! But within a half hour she was awake and calling, and then awake and coming to the door of her room. She didn't cry but asked for her mommy and daddy, and was successful at keeping herself awake, despite the deep breathing and blowing out all the air that I was encouraging! She works hard keeping those eyes open! Susan and Kevin walked in about ten p.m. and Susan took over. Kevin said the movie was great and they were happy to have seen it. </p>
<p>It was just 10:15 when we walked in the door, so I suggested we continue watching the (DVD) movie Doug had started over there. Off we go...  </p>
<p>Riku quote, sent by Bryn tonight: he was reading his dictionary (or "decorative" as he calls it)</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/11/grandpas_girl_and_tuckin_with.html">Grandpa's Girl and Tuck-In with Riku</a></h2>
								<p>Amelia arrived just after 8:30 this morning and was with me until 5:30; the day flew by. Susan told me that when she told Amelia she was coming to my house today, the first thing she said was "Play-doh!" And so we went right upstairs, after waving goodbye to Kevin, and I got the "green one" as requested. Amelia is happy to eat while playing and finished off her eggs, "sausage", and toast. She puttered about happily, sitting at the little kitchen table, perusing the new Hallowe'en books, and pushing the bumblebee around the house. </p>
<p>But mostly she wanted to spend as much time with Doug as she could manage today. At one point, she wandered into the living room, relocated the chicken sitting on a child's chair, carried the chair carefully into the dining room, and lined it up so that she was sitting right beside Doug at his desk. Of course she wanted some attention too, so exclaimed over the kaleidoscope, which she can pronounce perfectly!, and gave him big hugs around his neck too. What a girl!</p>
<p>Amelia didn't come empty handed today; Susan had sent over a bag full of goodies for us... gorgeous yellow flowers, a container of Belgium chocolate pudding, a jar of Trader Joe's mayonnaise which got "best-of" reviews, a package of "bacon" for Riku, as she knew I was out of it, and a package of Lucca's spinach filled ravioli, which we had for a delicious fast dinner tonight. That girl... how she spoils us! </p>
<p>Amelia has a cold, with a cough too, and we knew she was a tired girl. Even though she settled in very nicely, she napped for only 40 minutes in total, and that was that. However, she was happy and I didn't try to get her back to sleep, a quite pointless endeavour at the best of times. </p>
<p>Lunch time and Amelia once again carried her chair, into the kitchen this time, placing it right beside Doug's chair as he ate his lunch! I put her into her own chair while she ate, but she sat right beside him until it was ready. After lunch she managed a little snuggle with him too. Then followed...  painting, more books, some time upstairs on her own, until it was time for an afternoon nap. Again she settled in very nicely but awoke forty-five minutes later, happy as could be. </p>
<p>Off we went outside with some snacks, and two brooms. Amelia was very helpful, moving Riku's four trucks to a new spot, after dumping the rain water out of them, so that we could sweep under them. It was perfect outside for this; the day was cool but not cold, and I did a great clean up back there, putting away the three deck chairs in the storage area at the side of the house. </p>
<p>Some funny Amelia tales today... she ruffled my hair quite vigourously whilst proclaiming "pretty hair, Nana!" and then saying "big" after it was all puffed up! Something happened in the laundry room while she was playing with the various plastic toys, and Doug and I both heard her say "oh, my goodness!" Amelia gave lots of spontaneous hugs, not at all unusual, kissed me on the shoulder today as I put her sandals on, sang happily away to herself, paid attention to the children's songs on the cd, and repeats a chorus, and sings "ABCD..." so very well, for a just-turned-two year old. I managed to get it on video tape today and must do more taping of both children. </p>
<p>She remembered she had enjoyed the "I like you" man on the computer an d asked for it by that name, and then had a turn at knocking the little bears down from their stack, another computer game she likes. Now that she is using the mouse herself for this, she looks quite the professional! </p>
<p>Susan came by at 5:15, and of course we had to show her some of Amelia's favourite things we did today... we had played a matching game, which Amelia did so easily, with six cards, three pairs. So I added another pair and that was easy for her too. Susan hadn't thought she was ready for this yet, but she is more than ready, and I'm sure they will be playing it at home. Amelia also showed her mom the "I like you!" man on the computer and her prowess with the bears too. </p>
<p>I quickly made dinner, and we left the house at 6:15 to babysit Riku while Akane and Bryn went out to a movie; Riku and Bryn were playing with an elaborate train set when we walked in, and Riku was happy to let Grandpa take over when Bryn left. Bryn told Riku to tell me "just do the dinosaur puzzle first" when told him it was bedtime. He is doing so well at the puzzles, and ones that I find difficult! but by the time he was ready for bed it was too late for puzzles. I had played with the trains with him for a bit, we both drew in the living room for a while, read a story while he ate a piece of toast, and by then it was pj, teeth brushing and tuck in time. Despite his cough and congested breathing, or perhaps because of it, he was asleep within ten minutes easily, at 7:45. Akane had told me he had napped for only an hour this afternoon so I wasn't surprised at all then he dropped off so quickly. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn arrived home at 9:10 and off we went home. We had thunder and lightning earlier in the evening, a rare event here in San Francisco, but it ended fairly quickly. </p>
<p>Doug and I home at 9:30; up we went to watch a taped show and of course I fell asleep. I will catch up tomorrow on how it ended but for now it is bedtime... almost midnight. Too late!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/11/a_day_at_home_and_a_wee_visito.html">A Day at Home and a Wee Visitor too...</a></h2>
								<p>Since Doug and I took the afternoon off yesterday, the plan was to stay at home today and pretend it was a weekday. So, I got the ironing done whilst listening to NPR; I heard the funniest story, read by a woman author, Aggie Tippery, who teaches writing classes in Minnesota. I laughed out loud several times and thought how much Fay would have loved her sense of humour. </p>
<p>Later Doug looked her up on the Net, as I would have ordered her book but alas, it is out of print. Doug had gone to his Tai Chi class at 10 a.m. and then got home and went right to work on the computer. I wrapped birthday and Christmas gifts, tidied up a little in the kitchen, answered a couple of emails, and had Doug order three books for me from Amazon. </p>
<p>Bryn and Riku were out running errrands this morning; Bryn had called saying they would drop by around 1 p.m. as he planned to wrap Riku's birthday gifts here while Riku had his nap. </p>
<p>He was a tired boy, quite pale, but needed a little lunch first. He ate quite a bit of leftover noodle and veg' soup, half an English muffin, and some juice, but really protested giving in to his nap. It was so obvious that it was just what he needed, but he was overtired and not co-operative. I put his cotton blanket in the dryer for a minute, tucked his favourite stuffed dog in his arms, and held him until he quietened down. And then he slept for three and a half hours! He woke very briefly, less than a minute each time, three times during this period but I just "hushed" him, and left the room. </p>
<p>Riku is sooo much better today. It was a pleasure to hear such even breathing and not struggling to breathe through a clogged nose. However, the crying brought on some coughing which was hard to see, but he didn't cough at all once he fell asleep. </p>
<p>While he was napping I made two carrot cakes and had those both baked by the time Riku woke. I will ice them in the morning and shall make a single layer chocolate cake as well, for the family party to be held here tomorrow night at 6 p.m. </p>
<p>He awoke slowly and I lay with him for about ten minutes, as he slowly came round to opening those eyes all the way. Before his nap, Riku had told me he wanted to play with the Play-Doh so he sat at the table eating a snack of strawberries and another half of an English muffin. </p>
<p>Bryn came in from picking up Akane and a grocery store run, as Riku was finishing up with the Play-Doh, and told me a funny story. Often at home the three of them make a little joke about "Mommy is cute", and "Riku is cute" and finishing off with "Daddy is hairy!". Last night, Bryn was tucking him in earlier than usual, and Riku was asking for his mommy. When Bryn made it clear that he was tucking him in, Riku said in protest "No hairy Daddy, I want Mommy!" </p>
<p>Riku was reluctant to sit on the toilet today but I promised him a little surprise if he agreed to try. He did and was successful and very happy with the small cement truck I gave him. That little truck and his big "Caterpiller" truck kept him busy for a while too. </p>
<p>They went off at 6 p.m. and Riku will be back over early tomorrow morning so his parents can prepare for his party at 2 p.m. Doug and I had a delicious dinner, which took only twenty minutes to prepare. We bought a new Quorn product yesterday at Rainbow, a "cutlet" with Gruyere cheese, and I baked a sweet potato in the microwave, heated up creamed corn for Doug, and quickly made myself a small side dish of sauteed chard with pine nuts, and a little balsamic vinegar, which took all of five minutes to cook. </p>
<p>Off we went upstairs to watch the first three hours of our newest Netflix DVD "Angels in America". I took up a very large bowl of fresh walnuts to shell, a gift from Celeste last week. I have three big bowls to crack and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. I got through one and a half bowls tonight, and shall finish off the rest tomorrow night. They take up far less room like this and I shall put them in plastic bags in the fridge for banana breads over the next year! I am the only one in this household who likes walnuts, but Susan happily took some home with her last week. </p>
<p>"Angels in America" is just wonderful with a great cast of actors... Meryl Streep and Al Pacino amongst them. It was easy to stay awake for this, although it helped that I was busy with the walnuts I'm sure. </p>
<p>Doug and I went through some photos, managing to delete well over half of some taken at the music festival in early October. We were so far from the stage that we didn't get any shots of the singers, but we did get lots of good ones of Riku! Once I annotate those they will be up for viewing.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/11/dougs_water_girl.html">Doug's Water Girl</a></h2>
								<p>Amelia arrived at 8:45 this morning after I called to see if I could spend the day with her. Susan was delighted to have some time to run errands and I was more than happy to have these hours with Amelia. She gave me a big hug when she walked in the door, and after waving goodbye to her Daddy, we came right up to get the green Play-Doh.. and then the blue, and finally the pink. We made worms and cookies and sang "pat-a-cake" before moving on to Riku's new fishing puzzle. She likes it as much as Riku did. </p>
<p>When Amelia walked up the stairs this morning she spotted the toys and games of Riku's I had set aside to take over to Hampshire Street. She picked up his headrest from Gail saying "Oh, what is this?" When I put  it around her neck to demonstrate it she said "Oh, it is beautiful!" All day long these amazing sentiments were coming forth... "Oh, sorry sweetheart", or her classic "what you doing Nana?" followed by "Oh, I see." Doug and I often just look at each other after some of the things she comes out with. </p>
<p>We read all of Riku's new birthday books today, about ten of them, and did all of her usual favourite things in the house... upstairs on her own to play with the blocks, a little drawing in her own sketch book, pulling toys out from the laundry room where many of them are stored, and checking up on everything I was doing. </p>
<p>Amelia slept from 10:30 to 11:30; it is getting so easy, as when I was getting the bed ready for her, pulling down the spread she was already up on the pillows and lying down! </p>
<p>Doug had been out in the morning and Amelia was happy to see him; she spent as much time with him as he could spare, and making sure he was well hydrated by handing him his big bottle of water several times over the course of the next few hours. </p>
<p>Amelia went down for a short nap about 3:20 and slept for only forty minutes or so. She was happy though and this means that she might be ready for bed earlier for her mom this evening. We spent the last hour outside, raking leaves and playing in the garden, and then moving to the front of the house with the chalk while waiting for Susan to pick her up. She loved this and was soon running up and down, watching Doug do the recycling/garbage routine, and being her busy self.</p>
<p> When Susan arrived Amelia went running towards the car, saying "Mommy, Mommy, Mommy... " about a dozen times. We spent a little time outside together so that Amelia could show off her running skills to all of us; she can really move fast, that little girl! And she jumps and gallops too. She was wearing her leaf green sweater and pants today, my favourite colour on her, with a soft white bow in her hair. She looked so so sweet.. and of course is! </p>
<p>Susan brought me a double batch of unopened iris tonight; they are a deep purple and are just gorgeous in my Green Mountain pottery jug. I am picking Amelia up from nursery school tomorrow at 12:30 for the very first time; it will be fun to see where she spends two mornings a week these days. She's loving it, as I knew she would. </p>
<p>Bryn started my day off with a five word email from Japan "we are here. All well." It was good to know they had arrived safely; they were just landing as Doug and I turned out the light last night. It is such a long long flight... twelve hours and fifteen minutes. Ugh! </p>
<p>While I was tucking Amelia in this afternoon, Bryn Skyped with Doug. Riku had napped for only two hours on the flight, but was an A+ travelling companion, staying in his seat with seat belt on, keeping busy with his books, his drawings, two movies, snacking, and entertaining his neigbouring seatmates and charming the flight attendant. What a good little traveller he is! Good thing too, as they will be flying back to Japan in August for his Auntie Ayako's wedding. </p>
<p>And tonight while Doug was busy on his computer, Skping with his boss, mine rang and it was Riku online! Bryn told me he had made tea in his kitchen the day before and that it was the first thing he headed for when they arrived. I'm looking forward to my first cup too, as Riku is quite the host. He had been up, along with his parents from 4 a.m. their time in Japan and hadn't been willing to go to nap six hours later! Akane and Ayako were taking him out for a stroller ride, hoping that would do the trick. It will take them all a while to adjust to the time, although Bryn was working at 6 a.m. for a full day at the "office". </p>
<p>Doug is working long long days right now, but we did take a three hour break tonight to watch the final DVD of "Angels in America". It was such a good show, although it is hard for me to sit on the bed for that long and not fall asleep. I did it last time by cracking open the walnuts that Celeste brought us last week, but ran out tonight fifteen minutes before the end! Doug rewound it for me and I managed to keep my eyes opened.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/11/riku_pics_and_a_half_day_with.html">Riku Pics, and a Half Day with Amelia...</a></h2>
								<p>What a treat awaited me this morning when I turned on my computer! Bryn had sent out five photos of Riku via email, and I saw that little face beaming out at me. Of course, I immediately sent them out to everyone, family and friends alike. I checked Bryn's blog site quickly but must have just assumed it was an older one, as later on Bryn told me via email that he had written up two new ones; it was better that I discovered them later, as I had to dash off to shower as soon as I had emailed the photos off. </p>
<p>Later during the day, I had a chance to hear Riku say "hello there" to me on Skype; how wonderful that Bryn now has it on his computer. We were having some problems with it as it broke up a few times, and Riku got bored as we kept calling each other, but Bryn finally realized that if he rebooted all was well. The photos, and even a few minutes of Skype, sure makes a difference in not missing him quite so much. Bryn needs to get a wee photo of Riku up on the Skype screen so that little face appears when it's up. Hint hint! </p>
<p>However, I have the most wonderful screen saver on my computer, a slideshow of all my saved photos. It always amazes both Doug and me how often both Amelia and Riku will walk by, and then stop to watch as their own faces, or any of the others drift by. The Toronto cousins are there, Manitou, the aunts, Uncle Frank, Grandpa and Nana, Mommies and Daddies... perfect! It's really a hit with all of us. Candy said when she was here in March that she would never get a thing done in the kitchen if she lived here.  </p>
<p>Amelia attended nursery school this morning, and I had planned three appointments during this time period. I started off at the dermatologist's, and then drove right to the Mission to see the acupuncturist. To my surprise, the clinic was closed; I left a message for Valerie, and drove to Noe Valley to have my hair cut. Luckily, my favourite hairdresser was available, and in less than a half hour I was out the door, very happy with the results. I called Valerie again, no answer, so decided to have a manicure/pedicure today, instead of next week, with the spare hour and a half I had before picking Amelia up. What a treat this was! For just $18 I had both my hands and my feet pampered, and got to sit in a "massage" chair for over an hour. It wasn't busy, thank goodness, and my back enjoyed every minute of those kneading rollers up and down my spine and across my shoulders. Ahhhh! </p>
<p>Amelia's nursery school is in a lovely old Victorian house in the Mission, with a huge yard and a very friendly woman in charge. This was the first time I had picked Amelia up. She gave me a huge hug and big smiles when she spotted me, and we went off to the corner gelato store, which is already a tradition for Amelia and Susan. Amelia carefully examined her choices, decided on strawberry, and after one bite decided "Nana eat it". It was delicious although I wasn't particularly hungry for it, having picked up and eaten a Chinese spinach bun and an egg roll in Noe Valley, a rare treat these days. </p>
<p>Amelia's day was a typical one with me... Play-Doh time, a good lunch here since she had chosen not to eat at school today ("Amelia not hungry"), and then the timer set for ten minutes until nap time. Amelia slept for only 55 minutes and was obviously still tired when she decided it was time to get up. She threw off the blanket, sat up and said "Amelia happy! Amelia wake up by herself!" and I knew she wouldn't go back to sleep unless I lay down with her... which I won't do. </p>
<p>After a snack, we went out into the yard and did a little sweeping, although Amelia took off her own sandals, and watched from the doorway as I finished up. Because she was tired, we sat on the sofa and read about twelve books; her favourite one today was one called "Ten Little Rubber Ducks", one of Riku's birthday books from Kelly and Gregg. At one point, she got up to do something, pointed at me and said, pointing her finger at me "You sit there" and off she went. Uncle Frank says she may have a little of Queen Victoria in her blood! </p>
<p>Amelia gave Doug lots of attention today (not that this is unusual!), handing his water bottle to him frequently, and asking to see the kaleidoscope on his computer screen, just so she can perch on his knee and give him hugs.</p>
<p>She did the funniest thing today; Riku's noisy truck was in the corner of the dining area of the kitchen, and she would go over to it, push or pull the lever, and the minute it moved or "talked"... (it says "Don't forget your hard hat" or "Caterpillar power!" and shakes), Amelia would run as fast as she could across the kitchen, and stand watching it from the sink area! She was both fascinated and terrified by it; Susan reminded me later that she is quite sensitive to noise (she never did like the loud penguin from Kelly's very much), especially loud and repetitive noises, and this truck qualifies! It was funny to see her do it over and over again though. </p>
<p>Before we knew it, it was time for Kevin to arrive, so at 5:20 I put on Amelia's shoes and we went downstairs to walk in the dark. Just before this, we had been sitting up on my bed upstairs, reading several favourite books up there ("Go Dog Go"), and admiring the sunset. It was glowing a bright golden yellow at first, then sank lower and was a gorgeous pink with long streaks, and then changing again and again. I kept saying "It's beautiful!" and Amelia would echo my opinion "It's beautiful Nana!" and it was.  </p>
<p>She enjoyed being out in the dark. We crossed the street to look at the cat sitting on a car, wandered up to see the plaque of a woman's face on one of the houses (she was a little nervous of it until I touched the long hair and the face itself), and admired a few dogs out for a walk as we walked along a bit. Kevin pulled up, got a big big hug, and Amelia blew kisses as they drove off into the now totally dark night. </p>
<p>Doug and I seem to be watching a DVD each night since joining NetFlix; if only I could stay awake for the entire movie! It's just too easy to drift off once my tummy is full and it's dark. Mom always said I was a good baby... feed me and off to sleep I would go, and it's still true, unfortunately! We watched a missing (for us) episode of "Foyle's War", a British series we both enjoyed and were happy to find the one we missed on NetFlix. I did see 95% of it though and Doug filled me in on the rest of it. </p>
<p>Yawn! I don't have any trouble falling asleep at night...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/11/friday_already_1.html">Friday Already!</a></h2>
								<p>My gosh, the week has flown by. Riku and his parents have been gone for four full days and tomorrow Amelia and her parents are off to Seattle. It sure is going to be quiet and dull around here next week! </p>
<p>Amelia had her second flu shot this morning and went home for her nap after some time at the playground. I wasn't expecting to have the morning on my own, but made good use of the time by getting started on the cards due through the end of January. </p>
<p>Of course, I started off my morning by checking for Bryn's blog which wasn't up first thing today. I have some catching up to do myself so didn't feel I could complain much to Bryn about it. </p>
<p>Finally, though, the blog was up and some photos came through, so once again I sent them off to all whom I thought would be interested. One of Riku doing a puzzle was just beautiful; he looks so grown-up! </p>
<p>I was concerned that I hadn't heard from Uncle Frank about joining us for New Year's eve, along with Candy, Gerry and Lionel, so I called him. I am so glad I did, as he had been rushed to the hospital on Wednesday night immediately following dinner at By' and Jo's. He was there for only three or four hours but felt weak all day yesterday and was feeling only a bit better today.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/11/photo_album_day.html">Photo Album Day!</a></h2>
								<p>I went to bed last night thinking that today was the day I would start on one of my album projects; I have one in mind for Neal and one for Amelia, although Amelia's is a more casual one and not in a CM album.  </p>
<p>I answered some emails, made poached eggs, "bacon", and toast breakfast for Doug and me, read the Sunday paper whilst enjoying my hot chocolate, Skyped with Gail for a few minutes, and then called the children in Toronto. </p>
<p>Bryn had just won his second indoor soccer game against a team that hasn't lost yet, Caillie was leaving the house soon for her soccer game (it will be interesting to see if she finds it more to her liking than the outdoor games she played a couple of years ago), Myk' thought she might write me a letter today, as it has been ages since we have exchanged snail mail, and Bryant and his Dad were planning a day out to the Science Centre on their own. </p>
<p>Caillie sang the cutest song to me on the phone today; I told her that her cousin Lauren had really liked the book we sent her for her birthday. Caillie received it last year and when I told her where Lauren was up to in the book, she instantly broke out into the song. It was adorable. Then she sang a beautiful song that she will be singing at the school concert on the 3oth of this month; there were many verses to it and I would so like to get this on tape. Caillie has a lovely voice; she obviously takes after her mom and not her Nana. </p>
<p>Doug and I went through Mari's photos of Riku's birthday party, and also deleted the ones of ours that won't go in the online album. Unfortunately, Doug has too much to do today to finish off these pics, so I shall have to continue to be patient. I am not going to complain about Doug having steady work! </p>
<p>Except for time out for dinner upstairs, while watching one of our rental DVD's, a wonderful Scottish film that Doug had seen earlier in the year, called "Dear Frankie", I worked on the album for Neal all day. Of course I love this "work" so much, and really could keep at it all night. I finished 24 pages, and am up to his university days. There is still writing to be done, but I am concentrating for now on getting the photos in, in the right order! </p>
<p>I had written to Uncle Frank a few times today with various questions about Neal for the album, and hadn't heard back. I was quite concerned after hearing about his trip to the hospital last Wednesday and somehow my instinct was to call him. It was late there, 12:40 a.m. but I know that Uncle Frank does not go to bed that early and if he had he wouldn't likely hear the phone. Much to my relief, he picked the phone up almost immediately. I was right; he had had a tough day, felt weak after going out for breakfast on his own, and fell into a deep sleep after deciding to go home rather than continue with his shopping. We had a good little chat and I hung up feeling much better. </p>
<p>We dashed upstairs at 10 p.m. to watch "Gray's Anatomy" which we both like a lot, and down we came again. It's now 1:45 a.m.! Doug has just finished up the project he was working on, and I suppose it makes sense for me to turn in as well. I'm sure I will waken at 6:30 a.m. raring to go at it again. </p>
<p>I didn't talk to Riku at all today. Bryn and I typed on Skype tonight though; Akane had gone to the doctor who told her that Mireiis already bigger than Riku was, and expects her to deliver earlier than her due date, which is December 17th. This would be more than fine with all of us! Her parents want a November baby so that she won't have to wait an extra year to go to school; I want her born early in my visit (the 30th would be perfect), so that I can be there for the birth, and for Riku while Akane is in the clinic for five or six days. </p>
<p>Riku was off to a local doctor so we rang off; it is just a check up for tomorrow, Riku's first day at his new school. I shall be waiting to hear all about it, and am now waiting for today's photos from Japan! Guess I will see them tomorrow. </p>
<p>I soooo enjoyed tonight, and really wish I could find the time, and the energy to work on my albums every single day for an hour or two.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/11/christmas_wrappingphoto_sortin.html">Christmas Wrapping/Photo Sorting</a></h2>
								<p>That's basically my day in a nut shell! I haven't had quite enough sleep after our too-late-to-bed again last night... 12:45 when Doug rolled over and then I read a little longer. However, I felt fine at 6:45 a.m., and was ready to get busy at something on my list before starting in on the photos again. </p>
<p>I had a late though leisurely breakfast, as it just seemed the right thing to do for myself today. I do especially enjoy my big mug of hot chocolate each morning! Thank you Bryn, Caillie, and Amelia for providing me with such lovely homemade mugs, as that makes it even more special. Really truly. I LOVE my big mugs! </p>
<p>I did make it upstairs finally to get started at the hidden gifts. It was a fairly big job, pulling them all out from the two storage areas, and they made a big pile on the dining room table. However, before getting to it, I did a little vacuuming in the bedroom as the cedar chest was pulled out anyway. I do put off some jobs, substituting with others that I don't enjoy at all. I am not a very patient wrapper and would love to hire someone who makes them look as gorgeous as I would really like them too. </p>
<p>First I wrapped Uncle Frank's birthday gifts and got them ready for mailing; they mustn't be late as I have had them for some time. </p>
<p>I knew it was going to take hours to do the wrapping and sorting, and it did and in a couple of hours had made a big dent in it. </p>
<p>Since we had to go out to mail the parcel, I suggested to Doug that we have a burrito out for our lunch; it has been ages (our last was when Celeste was here and treated us), since we had what used to be a once or twice a week staple! We went to a new to me place at the foot of Potrero Hill; Doug has been there a few times and it was so good, moist and tasty, a little big zingy and filling. Yum! I flirted with a darling little boy at the next table; I think he was a three year old. </p>
<p>We weren't out long as Doug had to get back to work, but it was warm and gorgeous outside and the sun felt good. The house is surprisingly cool in the mornings, and I have been turning on the heat long enough to get the chill out. We are experiencing a beautiful Indian summer and this is a week when I have spent more time in the house than usual. I need the children here to get me outdoors, especially when I am so busy. </p>
<p>Back to the gifts when we got home, and I wrapped them all, including the few birthday gifts I have bought. Still have a little more shopping to do though, so the wrapping is not over yet! </p>
<p>Doug went off to his Tai Chi lesson at 5:45; I made a cup of tea, and sat for a few minutes enjoying it. Lots of emails flying back and forth between Gail and Candy and me today, as we sort through, or comment on, family history questions and Candy's health problems. </p>
<p>While I was sorting out the gifts upstairs this morning I decided to look to see if I could find some photos from the UK I had been looking for. No luck there, but I did find three ziplock bags full of more baby, childhood, teen and University photos of Neal! Included were the school photos I asked Uncle Frank about last night, some of the letters that Neal wrote to his grandparents in Colorado, graduation programs, report cards... it was a real bonus find! </p>
<p>And now, I have to revamp the album; I have more than enough photos for two albums, so will put the coloured photos aside and concentrate on the older black and whites for Christmas. Perhaps I can get the others done for Nea's birthday in April. What lucky boys these cousins of mine are, as Auntie Rita saved so many wonderful items for them, and Uncle Frank took so many photographs. </p>
<p>Before placing any more photos I really had to sort through them, so that took up the largest chunk of my time tonight. Doug has gone to bed and I must go up to, or tomorrow I really won't get much accomplished. I'm tired and need a break. </p>
<p>But, before I go... I had a brief typing session with Bryn this morning, who filled me in on Riku's first day of school yesterday. It went very well, he was a happy boy, only napped for a half hour and then got up and played with some puzzles. I bet he sleeps tonight, as he was there from 9-5, and was a busy boy the whole day I'm sure. </p>
<p>Here is a little quote from Riku yesterday, told to me by his Dad: I was singing along with Akane/Riku to a Japanese song, and he said something like "Daddy, don't sing, it's Japanese!"  </p>
<p>If you would like to hear another line from Riku go to:</p>
<p>weblog.bigtrouble.com and read Bryn's blog for the 21st (I think!)... hmm, let me think.. it was yesterday for him, but they are a day ahead... oh, I have no idea! I'm tired and I wanna go to bed...  </p>
<p>I had a lovely email from Kei in Japan this morning, a long and newsy one too; there was a second email with a photo of Tomoha all done up in a ceremonial kimono for a special Japanese holiday. Kei says she loved both the kimono and the make-up; this almost-three year old likes being a girl! </p>
<p>The clock is striking midnight, so off I go to bed. I can't believe I haven't talked to Riku now for two days. It seems such a shame when he is so accessible on the computer, but I suppose I will hear tomorrow what he did instead of talking to his Nana! I did see some wonderful photos his Dad sent through though, so perhaps that was supposed to suffice. It didn't. Night night!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/11/its_christmas_card_day.html">It's Christmas Card Day...</a></h2>
								<p><br />
.. at least in this house it is. A week today I will be in Japan! Doug took the day off today, as he has been working straight through many long days and nights for over a week now. He spent the morning finishing off a bit of work but then caught up on his emails until after lunch.</p>
<p>Kelly messaged through to let me know that Caillie now has her own hotmail account, and since she was home from school sick today we had a little online chat. I asked her what was wrong with her and here is what she replied and I quote: "i have a sines hedack my tommy herts i cant eat cause my throt herts so much" Poor sweet baboo. I bet she loved having her mommy to herself all day though.</p>
<p>Doug put five Christmas CD's in the player, I lay all the cards on the dining room table, Doug had the printed card list in front of him, and there we sat for four hours, with just a wee break now and then. This has been our tradition for many years; I do most of the writing on the inside of the cards and Doug writes the envelopes and puts on the return address stickers and the air mail stickers. It works well for us and we enjoy it, as long as we are not rushing through it. We have had years like that!</p>
<p>However, the plan this year, because we have to do them all within five days, is to write up a little blurb to enclose in some of them, stating what our plans are and a bit about what we have done this year. But, I find it almost impossible to just write my name on a card; Doug kept reminding me that I didn't have to, but gave up on me. Oh well, it's just what feels right to me...</p>
<p>On one of my breaks I read an email in from Susan; what a treat to have email and to so easily know what everyone is doing without having to wait until they are home! Here is a paragraph from her email; sounds like they are having a wonderful time. "We were on Bainbridge Island yesterday and it was lovely. Lovely just to get on a ferry that reminded me of being in B.C.. Lovely to go for a walk and throw stones in the water and hear sea lions barking and see cormorants drying their wings on old wharves... We visited Ellie and on Friday we may go back to the island to visit another family." At one point Tracy Gerster and I talked about how we should move "en group" to this Island. I would run the daycare centre, Bryn, Kevin, and Brad would work from their home offices, Susan would do her design work, Akane her art, and the children would grow up in a beautiful spot, with lots of room and fresh air. Ahhh, it's a dream that sounds perfect to me. There is even an independent movie theatre so it may be meant to be!</p>
<p>No word from Japan all day today; sad. No blog for yesterday. Sad. No new pics. Ditto.</p>
<p>Doug and I watched a very interesting rented documentary whilst eating our very simple baked potato with chopped egg dinner in a bowl. It was about a fellow who spent two years tracking down an author of a book out of print for over thirty years. Really, it was better than this description and Doug has ordered the book via Amazon. The book has been reprinted as a result of the documentary, which provided a very happy ending for the author. He had written only the one book... won't bore you with the details but we enjoyed it very much. The name of the book? "The Stones of Summer".</p>
<p>We did another forty-five minutes of card writing, and now we're both ready to call it a night. It's 10:20 p.m. I imagine Amelia is napping somewhere in Washington State, and since it is 3:20 Thursday in Japan, Riku may or may not be napping at his preschool. I shall have to be a very patient Nana and see what news tomorrow brings.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/11/happy_thanksgiving.html">Happy Thanksgiving!</a></h2>
								<p>Doug and I plan to be home all day with Doug working another full day and long night on a writing project and with me continuing on with Nea's album. </p>
<p>Bryn called on Skype just as Riku came stumbling into the "office". Riku told him he was sitting in HIS chair; Bryn takes that as a good sign as the Dyment's all have an assigned chair in their households! </p>
<p>They had plans and Riku slept in 'til almost 8, I believe, so they didn't have long to chat. However, I did get to speak to him for a few minutes, and I sang "Baby Beluga" to him before hanging up. He is off to school in less than an hour and Akane and Bryn are going to Kyoto today. </p>
<p>Oh, Doug and I gave big cheers for his success in the "toilet" room in the apartment. What a good job he is doing with two successes in two days.  </p>
<p>I got busy with the photos immediately and worked at it until Kelly messaged me, around 12:45 a.m. her time. Today is the day they are picking up the newest family member, Wiki (with a soft i); the eight week old beagle/Lab mix is going to be there to surprise the children when they get in from school this afternoon! We agreed to leave our Skypes open so we could share in the excitement of the children's reaction. Well, what a great idea that was, as we heard the children coming into the house and then four voices saying "oh, he's so cute", "can I hold her?", "she's so cute!" and Myk' was so proud of herself, as she had guessed just as she was about to go in the house that she thought the surprise was going to be a dog! </p>
<p>I have no idea where the day went today; my lower back is achy, so I've obviously be working hard, but I don't have a lot to show for it unfortunately. Doug scanned lots of photos for me today, as I came across them sorting through photos. There were lots of good responses to them, so that made it worthwhile doing! These were old family photos, which I had seen for the first time in the fall and they are all seeing for the first time now. </p>
<p>Later on Kelly sent me a lovely photo of herself holding two plates of Gregg's homemade sushi; he made it on the last weekend they were together. I must say that Kelly looked just great in the pink top and the black pants we bought her for her birthday. All those years Kelly didn't wear pink and she looks wonderful in it! </p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon and evening ran by in a blur of activity. We stopped to have our quick dinner upstairs while watching a PBS show on early Rock-a-Billy female singers. It was very interesting, showcased some great women with wonderful voices, even now, some forty or more years later. </p>
<p>And then back to work; I had a cup of hot tea while I rearranged photos from a few days ago, and so the evening passed. I meant to be in bed long before this, but started to clean up and then started the blog, hoping that perhaps Riku would be home from school before I went to bed. And it was worth the wait as Bryn did come on as soon as they walked in the house. Riku fell at school today and told me he was sad at naptime, but you can read all about it in Bryn's blog. Oh, he also said he spoke English at school today and yesterday led the class in the ABC's! When Akane picked him up at 5p.m. the teacher told her the other children would like to know some English songs so perhaps Riku will end up doing a little teaching when he is there! He did speak Japanese today though in class. </p>
<p>Didn't hear from Susan today so I have no idea what Amelia is up to; I imagine they enjoyed a delicious turkey dinner on Bainbridge Island, I believe. Oh, Mari wrote today, to wish us a Happy Thanksgiving. </p>
<p>It's 1:30. This is not good...  night night!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/11/friday_felt_like_saturday.html">Friday, Felt Like Saturday</a></h2>
								<p>... which was a good thing, as when I realized each time it was Friday I was relieved that I still had three full days to prepare for my trip! How this week has disappeared on me. I suppose working on Neal's album, which I am really enjoying, is responsible for the hours flying by. I just wish some days had twenty-four hours in them so I could work as long into the night as I wished. I must turn my light out before 2 a.m. tomorrow though! </p>
<p>I had a long chat on Skype with Don. He phoned to reminisce about Windsor Crescent and the hidden pathways I didn't know about in Auntie Rita and Uncle Frank's neighbourhood. He told me the name of a boy in a photo I didn't recongize (Doug was busy scanning photos for me right up until he went to bed at a most reasonable midnight!) and we went on to stories of our childhood and his children and my grandchildren, etc. etc. </p>
<p>I phoned Uncle Frank to verify some dates and facts with him re: the photos. He is feeling pretty tough today and promised he would call his doctor for a referral to a heart specialist. Hope he did so. We had some good laughs though, as he wrote today telling me that he didn't know about the radio station WKBW until I went to the cottage with them (Auntie Rita was in England; he said he thinks my mom sent me with him to keep an eye on him, and not the two boys!) and I played nothing else the entire week. I don't think he liked it one bit! and I do remember he would shut the radio off for certain songs he disapproved of! </p>
<p>Doug and I decided to go to Costco today; I wanted to buy dried fruit for Akane's mom (unavailable in Japan) and pistachios for Toronto and this was the day to be there. Everyone else is out in the big malls and so there were no lineups at Costco, Trader Joe's or Rainbow Grocery. We went through my lists in no time, and I now have most of the food stuffs I want to take with me on my trips. Doug will buy the sourdough and chocolates the day before he leaves on the 19th. </p>
<p>We came home to unpack the groceries and check our email; I called Toronto to speak to the children but missed all four of the children who had gone to their other parents for the weekend. Darn! However, Gregg filled me in on the latest antics of their new puppy, who is keeping them awake at night for forty-five minutes at a time. Manitou finally has enough of it and growls at her, and they just wish he wouldn't be so patient about it! She was leaping at Manitou when I spoke to Gregg; he said that Manitou was just trying his best to ignore her, as she bounced closer and closer to him to get a reaction and some playtime with him. Poor Manitou. It's exhausting being a new dad. </p>
<p>I needed my very favourite ground chocolate from Ghiardelli's, and Safeway was out of it, so we drove down to Fisherman's Wharf to the factory store. Now, that area was very busy, with lots of tourists wandering around the cool and blowy streets. We had heavy rain this morning, so our late fall weather has finally arrived. </p>
<p>Doug suggested pizza at Thomasso's in North Beach as we were blocks away; I have been very good resisting dinners out for the past two months, but gave in tonight. We think it has been eight years or more since we have eaten here and it was as good as always. The place had a line-up at 5:30 while other nearby restaurants were still waiting for the dinner crowds. It's a friendly neighbourhood kind of place, and we didn't mind the fifteen minute wait for our table. </p>
<p>We stopped for a few extra Christmas gifts on the way home, checked our email (of course!) and decided to do a few more cards tonight, before heading up earlier to bed than we have in a while. Bryn came on MSN for a few minutes, telling me that Riku had thrown up today on him, twice, while they were out! That may be the first time he has truly vomited a large amount of food; he seemed fine after that and they went home. Riku and his mommy were napping when Bryn called. Poor wee guy, but Bryn said he was very good about it and he calmed down very quickly with Bryn's reassurance that all was well. </p>
<p>We wrote twenty-five cards and have that many to do tomorrow and that is another job that can be crossed off the list. Seeing the bright lights and the huge trees decked out in holiday style made me realize for the first time this year that Christmas really is coming. The decorations have been up since August in so many stores that it didn't really feel special until today. I haven't been getting out much for the past month, at least not downtown where the Christmas season is more obvious. </p>
<p>Amelia comes home with her parents tomorrow; we will be picking them up at 1:30 tomorrow afternoon! I hope to be organized enough for my trip that I can spend some time with her on Sunday. </p>
<p>Off I go to bed; I told Doug I would be up by eleven so I shall close off for now and perhaps read more than two pages in my book tonight. Four sleeps until Japan!</p>

								<p>Doug and I were both awake at 7:15 this morning; I could have used another hour but of course the mind starts running up my list of things to do today, and that was that! I'm still working on Neal's album and it is looking very good to me. I had a long email from By' last night, telling me what he remembered about their dog, Lucky, so that I could more easily date some of the pics. </p>
<p>I called Neal just after lunch today and was lucky enough to catch him at home. He sounded just great! We had the longest chat we've had in a long time. I didn't tell him about the album, of course, as it is a Christmas gift, but we did talk about some old memories... about my playing WKBW, much to Uncle Frank's chagrin, and Neal confirming Don's story from yesterday about their secret path to the canal. Neal said they were lucky that nothing ever happened to them, as they used to sit on the end of the slough that had water pouring out of it to drain into the canal. It sounded dangerous and I'm sure their parents knew nothing about any of it. </p>
<p>He had talked to his dad earlier in the week and thought he sounded horrible; he's worried about him too, but he phoned me about an hour later saying he had called and found his Dad in good spirits and sounding much better. We exchanged lots of emails and he does sound better, as he made lots of funny comments about the questions I asked him. </p>
<p>We picked Amelia, Susan, and Kevin up from the airport at 1:30; It was so good to see them and I think they were happy to be met. Amelia has a cold, and was tired, but slept on the plane and was as good as gold. Her mom too has a cold as the air was dry and the house where they were staying overheated. However, they had a great time in Seattle, visiting with lots of friends, and getting in lots of sight-seeing and playground visits too. </p>
<p>The bad news today was that when Doug and I walked to the corner to pick up their Honda wagon for the trip to the airport, we found it had been broken into. Glass from the small non-rolling window, was all over the back seat, with Amelia's stuffed animals scattered about, Susan's knitting bag, etc. What an awful thing to come home to; this is the fourth time they have had their windows smashed in. </p>
<p>Kevin went off to have it replaced and so I had a little visit with Amelia and Susan. Amelia wanted to go home; despite her nap on the plane she didn't want to have to get in and out of another seat again. However, she and Susan had a little time upstairs with the blocks, while I chatted with Bryn for a couple of minutes, and then Amelia played with Play-Do for a little while, and watched her favourite little "I like you" man on the computer. She also sat on the counter handing me pistachio nuts to crack open for her. </p>
<p>Turns out that Riku has a little cold again, a runny nose and a bit of a cough... guess it can't be helped with their exposure to so many children. I was hoping to talk with Riku at some point today but it never happened.  </p>
<p>Kevin was back to pick everyone up at 3:30 and I got back to my photos. I spent a lot of time asking Uncle Frank questions this afternoon and tonight, and then Doug pasted them into Windows for me, so that I could print them up to go into the album. This makes it a much more personal album, which I hope Neal will like.</p>
<p>The evening flew by; Doug was working right up until 11:30 tonight and went up to bed immediately. I have lost track of one set of photos and it's driving me slightly crazy. I hoped to have all the black and white photos in the album so that I could start on the organizing for the trip on Tuesday. I am feeling fine about it though as I have been writing things down for ages so as not to forget anything. Almost all that needs to go to Japan, except for clothes, and to Ontario in two weeks, is gathered in the front bedroom, ready for Doug to pack.</p>
<p>Marie called tonight; she hasn't been in touch via email for ages and decided to call rather than try to type a novel!  </p>
<p>Off I go to bed too; I will get more accomplished tomorrow if I am rested... and it's almost past that point already! No photos from Kelly or Bryn today... and no blogs either.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/11/san_francisco_to_sakai_city.html">San Francisco to Sakai City</a></h2>
								<p>Today's the day; I'm off to Japan! I awoke at 6:45. It was a busy morning, but not hectic, as Doug did the final packing, and all I had to do was make sure it was all there for him. I took my one monster bag, and my old carry-on bag which will get checked as well. My two tiny carry-ons have lots of snacky foods for the flight, as well as reading material for the flight. Doug had to do some rearranging at the last minute, as the big bag weighed over 70 pounds, the legal limit for going to Japan.</p>
<p>We left for the airport at 10:15, arriving fifteen minutes later. Doug came in with me just in case I needed to move some of the weight around again, but all was well. However, all was not well with my seat as Doug had booked my flight using one of the search groups and we had forgotten to call United and book seats for all of my flights. This wasn't good, as all they had for me was a middle seat in a section of five seats, my worst flying nightmare! However, she said for $79 I could have an aisle seat in economy plus; it sure was tempting but for a one way seat it seemed a lot. We said goodbye at the security gate and while I was waiting at my gate asked if the flight was fully booked. I was told it wasn't and there was an aisle seat for me. Once on the plane I was told that fifty people didn't make this flight and so ended up with a double seat to myself, on the window!<br />
We were scheduled to leave at 12:25, but sat on the runway until 1 p.m. My flight schedule said our time to Japan would be 12 hours and fifteen minutes but the pilot announced it would be 11 hours and twenty-three minutes; I was happy to hear it might be almost an hour shorter, and settled in to read my one of the several magazines I had brought with me. We were served a pretzel snack mix and tomato juice before getting our meal about 2:30. It was hot and delicious... couscous, sweet potatoes, carrots, beans, and a tomato broiled on top. It was served with a green salad, a delicious roll, a chocolate chip cookie, and I finished off with hot tea. Our choice was "English" or "green".</p>
<p>I dozed off and on while watching two movies, "Must Love Dogs" and "Bruce Almighty". They helped pass the time but I was glad I hadn't paid to see them in a theatre. Having the extra seat beside me really helped with fatigue as I could stretch out and take up as much space as I chose to, without being aware of a passenger beside me. The time went by very quickly, and at 7 p.m. we were served a snack of sun chips, a tiny Toblerone bar, an almond cookie, and beverage service. I drank lots of water on the plane and had several cups of very strong tea with lots of milk.</p>
<p>It was strange to look out the window at 7:30 and see a brilliant blue sky with puffy white clouds. Of course I still had my watch set to SF time, so was used to it being dark by that time. A third movie kept me partially awake for a bit longer, although I also finished off the second of my magazines; "Bewitched" wasn't enough to hold my attention without a second diversion.</p>
<p>At 11 p.m. we were served a mini meal; I was glad it was hot and even though it was delicious it consisted of more sweet potatoes, this time mixed with white potatoes and baked. It came with a boring white bagel, cream cheese, applesauce, and two cookies, all of which I saved for Riku. I had noticed that at both lunch and dinner the non-vegetarian meals had come with a fruit bowl, and so I asked if there were any extras. The very thoughtful attendent brought me two of them, consisting of cantaloup, honeydew melon, and grapes. I ate both of them and then packed the two containers another attendent brought to me.</p>
<p>By 11:30 the sky had changed to the most beautiful pink with streaks, and it continued for the longest time. The pilot announced at 11:30 that we were passing over Mt. Fuji, and I was fortunate enough to be on the right side of the plane for this. I snapped a couple of photos, but by that time it was dark enough that they may not have turned out well. Hard to tell while they're still in the camera.</p>
<p>We landed at 11:55 p.m. S.F. time, just five minutes short of an eleven hour flight. Somehow we cut an hour and fifteen minutes off the original estimated time of arrival. It was such a good trip for me; I wasn't exhausted or nearly as anxious to get off the plane as I have been on the past two trips. That extra stetching space really made a difference.</p>
<p>My bags took a long time to come down the conveyer belt, but finally I went through customs and out to the big hallway to spot Bryn and Riku sitting on a bench waiting for me. It was so good to see them, and Riku was just so sweet. He gave me huge hugs, touched my face, put our noses together, and then more hugs. A few minutes later he said out of the blue, "I missed you Nana." and I told him that I sure had missed him too.</p>
<p>The train to Sakai-shi was waiting but we had time to get the suitcases on board, my two carry-ons stowed above us and the stroller folded up before it left. Riku immediately wanted the snacks I had told him I had with me, and he ate most of the applesauce, he and his dad each had a cookie although Riku insisted I have one half of his. We sang songs and chatted and looked at the lights outside, and before I knew it we were getting organized to get off for home. All looked very familiar and, after starting down the hallway to 2905, we could smell the tomato sauce Akane had prepared for our pasta dinner.</p>
<p>Akane is looking "out front" and big with this baby, but her doctor told her two days earlier that it wouldn't be any time soon. Not what we wanted to hear! The couple of hours to bedtime dashed by... our delicious dinner which included a green salad, some time admiring Riku's new fire station, which he put together on his own, with just a bit of help from Bryn, and then tuck-in time. While sitting at the table I told Riku Amelia had put some Play-Do in her mouth (I had told him I brought some with me for him) and Riku's response was "Oh, that was not good. What Auntie Susan say?" That was a new expression from him and we got quite a chuckle out of it.</p>
<p>The plan from now on is to have Riku sleep on his own in the small middle bedroom; he has been sleeping with his dad in the tatami room up to now, which is to be my room. However, we shall see how it goes. I tucked Riku into his bed, but he woke at the 45 minute mark and then again a half hour later. By that time it was close to 10:15, Akane and Bryn went off to bed and I decided I would do the same. And thus ends my first night in Japan.</p>
