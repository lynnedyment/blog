								<h2>The End of Another Week... Already!</h2>
								<p>I have no idea where the days went to this week, but fly by they did! I asked if I could have Riku today; he wasn't feeling up to par yesterday and I quite enjoy having the time with him at home, after all the half-days at nursery school. He will be off to Japan in less than two weeks, so the more time with him now, the better. </p>
<p>This may have been the first day ever that Riku did not "work" at his table in the kitchen, drawing and "writing" letters. Instead he chose the blue Play-doh, asking <strong>me</strong> to make a jellyfish! He seemed quite pleased with it and didn't break it up quite as quickly as he usually does, a good sign! Maybe he liked it! </p>
<p>He wanted to "throw the ball!" again today, so we went in the hallway, he sat on the bottom step while we rolled it back and forth. We do try to make him repeat wee Bryn's famous-in-the-fmaily phrase "this is not a bouncing ball, this is a rolling ball" but so far no luck! Yesterday he would put his hands up to his head the second I released the ball and I had him cupping his hands for it. Today we perfected it, as he didn't cover his head once! Just for fun, I covered mine and he said "No Nana, not do it like that!". Fast learner... and teacher too! </p>
<p>While I got him a little snack ready he went in to play catch with Grandpa. It was hilarious; Riku was laughing so hard as Doug pretended the ball was down his front, and would then put it down Riku's overalls too. Soon Riku was putting it down the front of Doug's robe, and laughing that wonderful delighted laugh as Doug pretended to search for it, finally letting it drop from his robe onto the floor. I managed to get this on video tape. </p>
<p>Riku was not coughing a lot, but when he did, it was a hard and nagging cough. I worry about pneumonia coming back, as I know it's likely to return once you have had it. </p>
<p>This was the second day I set the timer for Riku to warn him of his naptime. Today he asked for it! He said "put timer on; when it goes ring ring ring, it is naptime." My word, this is easy! I used to just tell him "ten more minutes", but it was easy to let it slide longer or forget when the time was up. He only slept an hour, which was fine, as I thought he would more easily get to sleep this afternoon, but it didn't happen and I should have encouraged him to stay in bed longer this morning... </p>
<p>He ate well, though, and did lots of juice and water drinking, so perhaps this flu/cold whatever will disappear quickly. We read some stories in the living room, working our way through some of the classics... "Little Red Riding Hood", "The Three Little Pigs" and the story of the runaway gingerbread man. These are in a Spanish language book, but it's easy enough to follow the stories with the great illustrations they have. </p>
<p>He had trouble breathing when lying down for his nap this afternoon, so I decided to put him in the stroller, hoping the fresh air would help him drift off. It didn't, but we walked for an hour, and he lay back commenting occasionally on what he was seeing. He was at least relaxing and having some quiet time, and I had a little walk too. Just on the off chance that Akane might be home, I rang their bell, and much to my surprise she was there! It was 5 p.m. and Riku went off upstairs with his mommy. </p>
<p>Doug and I were babysitting Amelia tonight, while Susan and Kevin went off to a movie, so we left the house at 6:20. Amelia was just delightful. Happy to see us after her first not-sure reaction, and then sat on the floor chatting, while building with Riku's blocks. She was a happy little camper, and it was such fun being with her. Doug and I sang a little made-up song about spiders crawling on first me, until she realized it was all in fun, and then on her! Before her bath at 7:30 she ate a container of yogurt and we shared some chips and guacamole too. </p>
<p>Of course I love bathtime with the children; Amelia was amazing as she puts her head way back in the water and stayed like that, telling me how strong she was, until I took a photo of her. She <strong>is</strong> strong! But she is gentle too, and bathed her little water baby, washing her hair, carefully keeping the water out of the baby's eyes. </p>
<p>Amelia loves getting lotion on her, and I laugh when I think about her turning over, butt in the air, so that I can put it on her back, and then flopping over to get her tummy taken care of too. She just lays back and enjoys the experience, lifting one arm and one leg at a time for the cream. She is going to love massages one day, just like her Mom and her Nana! Caillie is very much like this too, and was from the time she was a little girl like Amelia. </p>
<p>PJs, teeth brushed, three stories, and then Amelia told me it was bedtime! She put her head down, closed her eyes, and listened to me singing to her, while stroking her forehead. Minutes later she was gently snoring away. Ahh, that was easy, I thought! But within a half hour she was awake and calling, and then awake and coming to the door of her room. She didn't cry but asked for her mommy and daddy, and was successful at keeping herself awake, despite the deep breathing and blowing out all the air that I was encouraging! She works hard keeping those eyes open! Susan and Kevin walked in about ten p.m. and Susan took over. Kevin said the movie was great and they were happy to have seen it. </p>
<p>It was just 10:15 when we walked in the door, so I suggested we continue watching the (DVD) movie Doug had started over there. Off we go...  </p>
<p>Riku quote, sent by Bryn tonight: he was reading his dictionary (or "decorative" as he calls it)</p>
