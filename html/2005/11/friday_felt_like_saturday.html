								<h2>Friday, Felt Like Saturday</h2>
								<p>... which was a good thing, as when I realized each time it was Friday I was relieved that I still had three full days to prepare for my trip! How this week has disappeared on me. I suppose working on Neal's album, which I am really enjoying, is responsible for the hours flying by. I just wish some days had twenty-four hours in them so I could work as long into the night as I wished. I must turn my light out before 2 a.m. tomorrow though! </p>
<p>I had a long chat on Skype with Don. He phoned to reminisce about Windsor Crescent and the hidden pathways I didn't know about in Auntie Rita and Uncle Frank's neighbourhood. He told me the name of a boy in a photo I didn't recongize (Doug was busy scanning photos for me right up until he went to bed at a most reasonable midnight!) and we went on to stories of our childhood and his children and my grandchildren, etc. etc. </p>
<p>I phoned Uncle Frank to verify some dates and facts with him re: the photos. He is feeling pretty tough today and promised he would call his doctor for a referral to a heart specialist. Hope he did so. We had some good laughs though, as he wrote today telling me that he didn't know about the radio station WKBW until I went to the cottage with them (Auntie Rita was in England; he said he thinks my mom sent me with him to keep an eye on him, and not the two boys!) and I played nothing else the entire week. I don't think he liked it one bit! and I do remember he would shut the radio off for certain songs he disapproved of! </p>
<p>Doug and I decided to go to Costco today; I wanted to buy dried fruit for Akane's mom (unavailable in Japan) and pistachios for Toronto and this was the day to be there. Everyone else is out in the big malls and so there were no lineups at Costco, Trader Joe's or Rainbow Grocery. We went through my lists in no time, and I now have most of the food stuffs I want to take with me on my trips. Doug will buy the sourdough and chocolates the day before he leaves on the 19th. </p>
<p>We came home to unpack the groceries and check our email; I called Toronto to speak to the children but missed all four of the children who had gone to their other parents for the weekend. Darn! However, Gregg filled me in on the latest antics of their new puppy, who is keeping them awake at night for forty-five minutes at a time. Manitou finally has enough of it and growls at her, and they just wish he wouldn't be so patient about it! She was leaping at Manitou when I spoke to Gregg; he said that Manitou was just trying his best to ignore her, as she bounced closer and closer to him to get a reaction and some playtime with him. Poor Manitou. It's exhausting being a new dad. </p>
<p>I needed my very favourite ground chocolate from Ghiardelli's, and Safeway was out of it, so we drove down to Fisherman's Wharf to the factory store. Now, that area was very busy, with lots of tourists wandering around the cool and blowy streets. We had heavy rain this morning, so our late fall weather has finally arrived. </p>
<p>Doug suggested pizza at Thomasso's in North Beach as we were blocks away; I have been very good resisting dinners out for the past two months, but gave in tonight. We think it has been eight years or more since we have eaten here and it was as good as always. The place had a line-up at 5:30 while other nearby restaurants were still waiting for the dinner crowds. It's a friendly neighbourhood kind of place, and we didn't mind the fifteen minute wait for our table. </p>
<p>We stopped for a few extra Christmas gifts on the way home, checked our email (of course!) and decided to do a few more cards tonight, before heading up earlier to bed than we have in a while. Bryn came on MSN for a few minutes, telling me that Riku had thrown up today on him, twice, while they were out! That may be the first time he has truly vomited a large amount of food; he seemed fine after that and they went home. Riku and his mommy were napping when Bryn called. Poor wee guy, but Bryn said he was very good about it and he calmed down very quickly with Bryn's reassurance that all was well. </p>
<p>We wrote twenty-five cards and have that many to do tomorrow and that is another job that can be crossed off the list. Seeing the bright lights and the huge trees decked out in holiday style made me realize for the first time this year that Christmas really is coming. The decorations have been up since August in so many stores that it didn't really feel special until today. I haven't been getting out much for the past month, at least not downtown where the Christmas season is more obvious. </p>
<p>Amelia comes home with her parents tomorrow; we will be picking them up at 1:30 tomorrow afternoon! I hope to be organized enough for my trip that I can spend some time with her on Sunday. </p>
<p>Off I go to bed; I told Doug I would be up by eleven so I shall close off for now and perhaps read more than two pages in my book tonight. Four sleeps until Japan!</p>
