								<h2>It's Christmas Card Day...</h2>
								<p><br />
.. at least in this house it is. A week today I will be in Japan! Doug took the day off today, as he has been working straight through many long days and nights for over a week now. He spent the morning finishing off a bit of work but then caught up on his emails until after lunch.</p>
<p>Kelly messaged through to let me know that Caillie now has her own hotmail account, and since she was home from school sick today we had a little online chat. I asked her what was wrong with her and here is what she replied and I quote: "i have a sines hedack my tommy herts i cant eat cause my throt herts so much" Poor sweet baboo. I bet she loved having her mommy to herself all day though.</p>
<p>Doug put five Christmas CD's in the player, I lay all the cards on the dining room table, Doug had the printed card list in front of him, and there we sat for four hours, with just a wee break now and then. This has been our tradition for many years; I do most of the writing on the inside of the cards and Doug writes the envelopes and puts on the return address stickers and the air mail stickers. It works well for us and we enjoy it, as long as we are not rushing through it. We have had years like that!</p>
<p>However, the plan this year, because we have to do them all within five days, is to write up a little blurb to enclose in some of them, stating what our plans are and a bit about what we have done this year. But, I find it almost impossible to just write my name on a card; Doug kept reminding me that I didn't have to, but gave up on me. Oh well, it's just what feels right to me...</p>
<p>On one of my breaks I read an email in from Susan; what a treat to have email and to so easily know what everyone is doing without having to wait until they are home! Here is a paragraph from her email; sounds like they are having a wonderful time. "We were on Bainbridge Island yesterday and it was lovely. Lovely just to get on a ferry that reminded me of being in B.C.. Lovely to go for a walk and throw stones in the water and hear sea lions barking and see cormorants drying their wings on old wharves... We visited Ellie and on Friday we may go back to the island to visit another family." At one point Tracy Gerster and I talked about how we should move "en group" to this Island. I would run the daycare centre, Bryn, Kevin, and Brad would work from their home offices, Susan would do her design work, Akane her art, and the children would grow up in a beautiful spot, with lots of room and fresh air. Ahhh, it's a dream that sounds perfect to me. There is even an independent movie theatre so it may be meant to be!</p>
<p>No word from Japan all day today; sad. No blog for yesterday. Sad. No new pics. Ditto.</p>
<p>Doug and I watched a very interesting rented documentary whilst eating our very simple baked potato with chopped egg dinner in a bowl. It was about a fellow who spent two years tracking down an author of a book out of print for over thirty years. Really, it was better than this description and Doug has ordered the book via Amazon. The book has been reprinted as a result of the documentary, which provided a very happy ending for the author. He had written only the one book... won't bore you with the details but we enjoyed it very much. The name of the book? "The Stones of Summer".</p>
<p>We did another forty-five minutes of card writing, and now we're both ready to call it a night. It's 10:20 p.m. I imagine Amelia is napping somewhere in Washington State, and since it is 3:20 Thursday in Japan, Riku may or may not be napping at his preschool. I shall have to be a very patient Nana and see what news tomorrow brings.</p>
