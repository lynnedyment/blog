								<h2>Caterpiller Power!</h2>
								<p>Celeste and Melinda had just left when I came downstairs at 7:30 this morning and Doug left fifteen minutes later. I answered a few emails, sorted through some gifts in the cedar chest, and had time to read the paper and eat before Riku arrived at 9 a.m. Bryn said he was a sick boy, and he was... coughing and sniffly and pale. Later in the morning he was running a slight fever too. Before that though he sat and played with playdo at the table, ate a little toast and "bacon", drank a small glass of juice and was ready for a wee nap at 10:30. He slept for only forty-five minutes which was fine, as I would rather he had a longer nap in the afternoon. </p>
<p>Doug and I decided to give Riku one of his big birthday gifts early, as he is leaving for Japan just two days later. The big truck we had picked out for him was a huge hit! It took he and I quite a long time to get it separated from the packaging, and so he pretended we were "workers" and we were "working hard" at it all. We really were! I had to find a screw driver as there were screws holding down the wheels, as well as lots of plastic wiring holding the front end down onto cardboard. </p>
<p>The next hour was spent with this very loud machine, working away in the kitchen. It backs up, runs forward, has gears to dump the back end and bring it up again, there is music, the truck vibrates, it reminds you to wear your hard hat! and the thing Riku loves best, I think, is when the right button pushed comes out with "caterpiller power!" He says it every time with lots of emphasis on the "power". This was a great gift for him and Bryn got a big kick out of it too, when he came to pick Riku up at 6:15. In fact, he realized I hadn't released the wheels and we actually saw it moving backwards and foreward. </p>
<p>We had a little quiet tv time, a rare event for us; this might have been our second time watching tv ever together here! I put on my children's tape from Hawaii; Riku kept asking me for the "polar bear" and I have no idea what he meant. I asked Bryn and he didn't know either so my guess it is something that he sees at home with Akane. Riku liked the whale and the owl on the kekei tape, and I certainly enjoyed watching it again. Bryn and Caillie were crazy about this tape when they were younger and it brought back lots of good memories. </p>
<p>Susan called and I had a little chat with Amelia, who was going to a swim session this afternoon, and told me she had gone on the trapeze yesterday. She asked if Riku was napping and I told her he was sick; she asked twice more about him. We were hoping to have some playground time together today but Riku needs to stay put and not expend a lot of energy. Amelia sounded so sweet and it was lovely to hear her little voice. </p>
<p>Riku had a nice long nap in the early afternoon after eating a good-size portion of a homemade noodle soup with lots of vegies in it. He woke at an hour and twenty minutes, I asked him if he was ready to get up or if he would like to sleep a little big more. His answer "I would like to sleep a little bit more", he rolled over, pulled his cotton blanket up around him, and was asleep for another forty minutes. </p>
<p>He ate some more soup, and we went upstairs to read some books, sitting together on the bed. He was pretty warm still, his hands so hot, and he was happy to snuggle up and read all about jelly fish, a book from Kelly. He perked up after that, and Bryn found us upstairs, sitting on the floor with the truck and the blocks, filling it up and dumping it over and over. </p>
<p>They left at 6:30, Celeste and Melinda arrived home at 6:45, and Doug a half hour later. We had quite an adventure trying to go out for dinner, Celeste's and Melinda's treat. We set off to Luna, an upscale Mexican restaurant Doug and Dave ate at last week; Doug had raved about it, and Celeste and Melinda decided we should try it too. After driving downtown, we found out it was closed for a private party. Off to the outer Mission to go to "Mom is Cookin'" and found the sign gone and the restaurant closed completely! We've been going there for twenty years and it is gone! Back to the Mission District for a burrito at La Papalote.. it was fine, but just... too salty and with an uninteresting marinated tofu. </p>
<p>Doug booked me for my up-coming almost-two month trip. I fly from here on the 29th of November for a flight to Osaka, leave there (hopefully with Mieri Elizabeth having made an early arrival!), on the 20th of December, and flying back to SF on January the 17th.  </p>
<p>Raining tonight... first serious rain of the season. </p>
<p>Bed at 11:30...</p>
