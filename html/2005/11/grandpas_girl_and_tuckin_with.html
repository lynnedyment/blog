								<h2>Grandpa's Girl and Tuck-In with Riku</h2>
								<p>Amelia arrived just after 8:30 this morning and was with me until 5:30; the day flew by. Susan told me that when she told Amelia she was coming to my house today, the first thing she said was "Play-doh!" And so we went right upstairs, after waving goodbye to Kevin, and I got the "green one" as requested. Amelia is happy to eat while playing and finished off her eggs, "sausage", and toast. She puttered about happily, sitting at the little kitchen table, perusing the new Hallowe'en books, and pushing the bumblebee around the house. </p>
<p>But mostly she wanted to spend as much time with Doug as she could manage today. At one point, she wandered into the living room, relocated the chicken sitting on a child's chair, carried the chair carefully into the dining room, and lined it up so that she was sitting right beside Doug at his desk. Of course she wanted some attention too, so exclaimed over the kaleidoscope, which she can pronounce perfectly!, and gave him big hugs around his neck too. What a girl!</p>
<p>Amelia didn't come empty handed today; Susan had sent over a bag full of goodies for us... gorgeous yellow flowers, a container of Belgium chocolate pudding, a jar of Trader Joe's mayonnaise which got "best-of" reviews, a package of "bacon" for Riku, as she knew I was out of it, and a package of Lucca's spinach filled ravioli, which we had for a delicious fast dinner tonight. That girl... how she spoils us! </p>
<p>Amelia has a cold, with a cough too, and we knew she was a tired girl. Even though she settled in very nicely, she napped for only 40 minutes in total, and that was that. However, she was happy and I didn't try to get her back to sleep, a quite pointless endeavour at the best of times. </p>
<p>Lunch time and Amelia once again carried her chair, into the kitchen this time, placing it right beside Doug's chair as he ate his lunch! I put her into her own chair while she ate, but she sat right beside him until it was ready. After lunch she managed a little snuggle with him too. Then followed...  painting, more books, some time upstairs on her own, until it was time for an afternoon nap. Again she settled in very nicely but awoke forty-five minutes later, happy as could be. </p>
<p>Off we went outside with some snacks, and two brooms. Amelia was very helpful, moving Riku's four trucks to a new spot, after dumping the rain water out of them, so that we could sweep under them. It was perfect outside for this; the day was cool but not cold, and I did a great clean up back there, putting away the three deck chairs in the storage area at the side of the house. </p>
<p>Some funny Amelia tales today... she ruffled my hair quite vigourously whilst proclaiming "pretty hair, Nana!" and then saying "big" after it was all puffed up! Something happened in the laundry room while she was playing with the various plastic toys, and Doug and I both heard her say "oh, my goodness!" Amelia gave lots of spontaneous hugs, not at all unusual, kissed me on the shoulder today as I put her sandals on, sang happily away to herself, paid attention to the children's songs on the cd, and repeats a chorus, and sings "ABCD..." so very well, for a just-turned-two year old. I managed to get it on video tape today and must do more taping of both children. </p>
<p>She remembered she had enjoyed the "I like you" man on the computer an d asked for it by that name, and then had a turn at knocking the little bears down from their stack, another computer game she likes. Now that she is using the mouse herself for this, she looks quite the professional! </p>
<p>Susan came by at 5:15, and of course we had to show her some of Amelia's favourite things we did today... we had played a matching game, which Amelia did so easily, with six cards, three pairs. So I added another pair and that was easy for her too. Susan hadn't thought she was ready for this yet, but she is more than ready, and I'm sure they will be playing it at home. Amelia also showed her mom the "I like you!" man on the computer and her prowess with the bears too. </p>
<p>I quickly made dinner, and we left the house at 6:15 to babysit Riku while Akane and Bryn went out to a movie; Riku and Bryn were playing with an elaborate train set when we walked in, and Riku was happy to let Grandpa take over when Bryn left. Bryn told Riku to tell me "just do the dinosaur puzzle first" when told him it was bedtime. He is doing so well at the puzzles, and ones that I find difficult! but by the time he was ready for bed it was too late for puzzles. I had played with the trains with him for a bit, we both drew in the living room for a while, read a story while he ate a piece of toast, and by then it was pj, teeth brushing and tuck in time. Despite his cough and congested breathing, or perhaps because of it, he was asleep within ten minutes easily, at 7:45. Akane had told me he had napped for only an hour this afternoon so I wasn't surprised at all then he dropped off so quickly. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn arrived home at 9:10 and off we went home. We had thunder and lightning earlier in the evening, a rare event here in San Francisco, but it ended fairly quickly. </p>
<p>Doug and I home at 9:30; up we went to watch a taped show and of course I fell asleep. I will catch up tomorrow on how it ended but for now it is bedtime... almost midnight. Too late!</p>
