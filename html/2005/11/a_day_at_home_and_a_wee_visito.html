								<h2>A Day at Home and a Wee Visitor too...</h2>
								<p>Since Doug and I took the afternoon off yesterday, the plan was to stay at home today and pretend it was a weekday. So, I got the ironing done whilst listening to NPR; I heard the funniest story, read by a woman author, Aggie Tippery, who teaches writing classes in Minnesota. I laughed out loud several times and thought how much Fay would have loved her sense of humour. </p>
<p>Later Doug looked her up on the Net, as I would have ordered her book but alas, it is out of print. Doug had gone to his Tai Chi class at 10 a.m. and then got home and went right to work on the computer. I wrapped birthday and Christmas gifts, tidied up a little in the kitchen, answered a couple of emails, and had Doug order three books for me from Amazon. </p>
<p>Bryn and Riku were out running errrands this morning; Bryn had called saying they would drop by around 1 p.m. as he planned to wrap Riku's birthday gifts here while Riku had his nap. </p>
<p>He was a tired boy, quite pale, but needed a little lunch first. He ate quite a bit of leftover noodle and veg' soup, half an English muffin, and some juice, but really protested giving in to his nap. It was so obvious that it was just what he needed, but he was overtired and not co-operative. I put his cotton blanket in the dryer for a minute, tucked his favourite stuffed dog in his arms, and held him until he quietened down. And then he slept for three and a half hours! He woke very briefly, less than a minute each time, three times during this period but I just "hushed" him, and left the room. </p>
<p>Riku is sooo much better today. It was a pleasure to hear such even breathing and not struggling to breathe through a clogged nose. However, the crying brought on some coughing which was hard to see, but he didn't cough at all once he fell asleep. </p>
<p>While he was napping I made two carrot cakes and had those both baked by the time Riku woke. I will ice them in the morning and shall make a single layer chocolate cake as well, for the family party to be held here tomorrow night at 6 p.m. </p>
<p>He awoke slowly and I lay with him for about ten minutes, as he slowly came round to opening those eyes all the way. Before his nap, Riku had told me he wanted to play with the Play-Doh so he sat at the table eating a snack of strawberries and another half of an English muffin. </p>
<p>Bryn came in from picking up Akane and a grocery store run, as Riku was finishing up with the Play-Doh, and told me a funny story. Often at home the three of them make a little joke about "Mommy is cute", and "Riku is cute" and finishing off with "Daddy is hairy!". Last night, Bryn was tucking him in earlier than usual, and Riku was asking for his mommy. When Bryn made it clear that he was tucking him in, Riku said in protest "No hairy Daddy, I want Mommy!" </p>
<p>Riku was reluctant to sit on the toilet today but I promised him a little surprise if he agreed to try. He did and was successful and very happy with the small cement truck I gave him. That little truck and his big "Caterpiller" truck kept him busy for a while too. </p>
<p>They went off at 6 p.m. and Riku will be back over early tomorrow morning so his parents can prepare for his party at 2 p.m. Doug and I had a delicious dinner, which took only twenty minutes to prepare. We bought a new Quorn product yesterday at Rainbow, a "cutlet" with Gruyere cheese, and I baked a sweet potato in the microwave, heated up creamed corn for Doug, and quickly made myself a small side dish of sauteed chard with pine nuts, and a little balsamic vinegar, which took all of five minutes to cook. </p>
<p>Off we went upstairs to watch the first three hours of our newest Netflix DVD "Angels in America". I took up a very large bowl of fresh walnuts to shell, a gift from Celeste last week. I have three big bowls to crack and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. I got through one and a half bowls tonight, and shall finish off the rest tomorrow night. They take up far less room like this and I shall put them in plastic bags in the fridge for banana breads over the next year! I am the only one in this household who likes walnuts, but Susan happily took some home with her last week. </p>
<p>"Angels in America" is just wonderful with a great cast of actors... Meryl Streep and Al Pacino amongst them. It was easy to stay awake for this, although it helped that I was busy with the walnuts I'm sure. </p>
<p>Doug and I went through some photos, managing to delete well over half of some taken at the music festival in early October. We were so far from the stage that we didn't get any shots of the singers, but we did get lots of good ones of Riku! Once I annotate those they will be up for viewing.</p>
