								<h2>Hot and Humid!</h2>
								<p>Well, that generous glass of port Uncle Frank poured last night certainly helped me sleep; I awoke at 9:30 this morning feeling well rested. I went into the shower immediately and when I finished UF called to me that there was a hot cup of tea awaiting me in my room. Lovely... such service! </p>
<p>Uncle Frank had slept in as well, although he had stayed up a little later, drinking a cup of Sleepytime tea and reading first. I joined him at the table for breakfast, cereal, toast, and orange juice, while we discussed how we would spend our day.</p>
<p>First order of business was to take care of the very damp basement. </p>
<p>UF went off to buy cleaning supplies for the rug, while I moved furniture and tried soaking up some of the water with a rug-shampoo machine. It wasn't working and UF did the hot tedious job of cleaning the rug with the machine. It is a hot humid day and it was very hard work. He let it soak in for a bit, and then we both worked at pulling it up once again with the machine. We did this off and on throughout the day, taking turns at running the machine. UF put two fans in the windows, and that seemed to be working very well indeed. </p>
<p>We stopped for lunch; I made toasted tomato sandwiches with Havarti cheese. UF thoroughly enjoyed his lunch, and told me so; I know that eating something that someone else has made makes any food taste better, and it was nice to see how much he appreciated such a small gesture. We kept busy at the drying-out project throughout the day, moving things around, stamping around on two flannel sheets we laid down, looking quite the pair as we did this. I thought how funny it would have looked if someone had peeked in the window at us. UF was stomping around the perimeter, moving toward the centre, while I marched up and down in a parallel pattern. It was quite effective though and did the trick. We did a little more moving around of furniture, got out the dehumidifier, and things are drying up nicely, if slowly. The high humidity isn't helping a bit. </p>
<p>Later on when we realized we were hungry, we headed out to Stamford Centre, deciding at the last minute on fish and chips. Lucky us! They had a Tuesday special on it and so we had two small orders of haddock and chips for just $4.25 instead of $6.25. We thought it would be more relaxing to eat at home, and so had take-out wrapped in the traditional way... in newspaper. </p>
<p>We went back home and moved more furniture around and started playing some old cassette tapes and CDs to decide on which to keep and which to toss. This was lots of fun, as many of the cassettes weren't labelled and it sometimes took a while to figure out just what we were listening to. Of course we had tea, and had to sit in the kitchen as the room downstairs is out of order, but we relaxed and the evening flew by. We had our port, of course, and read the papers, and despite our intention to get to bed early it was 2 a.m. when I turned out my light... although I didn't read for long!</p>
