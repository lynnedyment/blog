								<h2><a href="/2005/08/pretty_pink.html">Pretty Pink!</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke earlier than usual today; guess my body has had enough of this sleeping-in business! I was downstairs and showered at 7:30 this morning, checking my email and starting the laundry, both ours and Akane's and Bryn's, which he dropped off yesterday. I also dashed off to the hospital with a card for the 9:30 a.m. pick-up; I had a card for the UK which had to be mailed asap. </p>
<p>Even though yesterday I had thoroughly watered the six thriving blooming pots of flowers that Susan planted a few weeks ago (they are looking full and gorgeous!), I noticed they needed another good soaking, so did that as soon as I got home. Then it was time to read the paper, while having a banana and my big mug of hot chocolate.</p>
<p>I decided I really did not want to be doing last week's ironing tomorrow, so went back upstairs to change the bedding and iron the five remaining shirts. Susan called while I was up there to see if Riku and I would like to join them at Ocean Beach today. It is very foggy over on that side of the city, but it was sunny here, so the chances were good that it was going to burn off later on. </p>
<p>Chatted with Bryn on IM for a bit; Akane and Riku had plans to go to the library in the early afternoon, and no doubt he would be napping in the stroller, after which it would be too late for me to take him to the beach. Doug and I planned to go to an author's reading tonight in San Mateo, so I would have to be back home by 6 p.m. So, we will have an Ocean Beach day tomorrow if the weather holds. It's often either foggy or windy over there, but we might be lucky. Riku could nap in the car while I read, with the ocean view... lovely! </p>
<p>It was time to get that pedicure I forgot to get on my birthday. Finishing the ironing seemed like a good reason to treat myself so I called and found out that it wasn't busy and I could just walk on in. Doug wanted to go to Safeway and Rainbow, he is the shopper in the family!, so he dropped me off, agreeing to pick me up in an hour. I was in for a very nice surprise! Susan had given me a gift certificate for what is reputedly the "hot" spot in the city to have a manicure/pedicure; it's called "Mani-Pedi" and is right here in Potrero Hill.  I thought the certificate was for a pedicure but it was also for a manicure and a special ten minute foot massage too. It was heavenly! They have vibrating chairs, with various settings and lots of People magazines to browse through. However, once it started I just lay back and enjoyed every minute of it. How I love, love, love having my feet massaged! I chose a nice bright, but not too bright!, pink for my toes, for a change. I usually go with something a little more subtle but I am off to San Diego soon, so decided to go for something different. Because it wasn't busy, I got to stay in that lovely moving lounging chair while the polish dried. My fingernails are tidied up and all one length now but I have clear polish on those... no point going overboard here! </p>
<p>After all that lovely relaxing time, I managed to get lots done during the rest of the day. Laundry took up a lot of time, I wrote a couple of notes, annotated some photos, and answered a lot of emails. And so went my day... nothing exciting happened... although we did have another piece of Bryn's cake, and I polished off the end of his pasta salad. I was very hungry when I got back from my "treatments". </p>
<p>I was still working on the laundry in the early evening, and so decided not to go to the reading with Doug after all. I have so many little jobs to do and they are just not getting done. Apparently I missed a great reading, and as the audience was small, missed a great informal chatty evening with the author and the small group that attended. It felt good though to get ahead of some of the jobs on my list, and I was more relaxed at the end of the evening than I would have been otherwise. I also got to IM with Kelly for a bit; she is home from the Manitoulin and on her own for four days! Gregg is away on business in Ottawa, and the children are with their grandparents. I might actually get to talk with my daughter this week! She didn't even know I was going to San Diego on Thursday... we are so out of touch these days, with too much going on in both of our houses. </p>
<p>It's 10:30 and I am off to fold another load of laundry (one more to go), before heading upstairs to get involved in one of my birthday books. Bryn is at ping pong tonight, so no good night phone call from my little guy...</p>

								<p>Today Riku tore a piece of paper leaving a little handle on the bottom, so it was shaped like ice cream on a stick. He was very proud of himself and I was amazed by it! He worked at it very seriously, furrowing his brows...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/08/lunch_with_amelia_evening_with.html">Lunch with Amelia, Evening with Ian</a></h2>
								<p>'twas another busy day, although it started it off in a leisurely fashion. I woke at 8 a.m. and got busy with emails and a blog entry, put it a load of laundry and sorted through a few envelopes of photos. Had eggs and toast for breakfast along with our half whole wheat Italian loaf, cleaned the stove, finished cleaning the fridge, cooked up some of last year's rhubard for UF's desserts, and tidied up the laundry room a bit. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank decided to drive me out to Amelia's and Jake's so that he could run some errands in the car on his own this afternoon. There was road construction going on Garner Road so we had to turn back and take the long way 'round to their house. Jake is working the chip wagon today but was kind enough to make up potato pancakes for our lunch today. They were just delicious... tender and tasty! and I ate four of them. We did have a glass of wine first and ate a lovely green salad while the pancakes were heating up. </p>
<p>Amy and I had a good long stretch of time to catch up on all our news.. our grandchildren, our children, and trips and plans for the next year. It was so relaxing sitting in their bright and cozy den, feet up, relaxed and happy to have the time together. Tea followed, and at 4:15 UF picked me up. He had had a hard time finding his way back to us as there was more work going on, but I had called the hairdresser and told her I would be late. </p>
<p>Arrived at Studio 54 at 4:30 and was finished at 5 p.m. Had a new stylist called Karla who did a very good job with the cut, although it is much shorter than I intended it being. UF picked me up</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/08/the_day_flew_by.html">The Day Flew By!</a></h2>
								<p>It was a busy, busy, day today although not quite as productive as I thought I would be. Doug is in Seattle and I don't have Riku today. Despite having the house to myself, or perhaps because I had the house to myself, I chatted with all three of my sisters today. Beth and I spoke on Skype for quite a while, and then Gail came on after Beth left. I dashed up to shower, made the bed, and made my breakfast... "bacon", an egg and a thick piece of toast made with bread Bryn brought over on Sunday morning. It is thick enough that I can cut it in half and still have my two pieces of toast... yummy.</p>
<p>Candy called just as I put my hot chocolate on the table, along with the paper. Our cordless phones are not working well right now, so I started chatting in the kitchen while eating my breakfast, changed to the bedroom phone upstairs, and ended up sitting on the floor in Riku's room. We hung up at exactly noon hour!</p>
<p>I quickly got busy, deciding to get the ironing out of the way. That done I answered a few emails, made room for our new indoor grill in the pots and pan cupboard, cooked up some rhubarb, and made banana bread for Akane, Bryn, and Riku.</p>
<p>Today in the mail I received a long chatty letter from Kei in Japan. I am surprised she didn't email, as we have exchanged emails, and now I wonder if I should respond to her via a handwritten note as well. I won't answer immediately and will think about this.</p>
<p>I sat upstairs in late afternoon with a cup of hot tea and a bowl of fruit salad, flicking through the tape of Oprah shows Doug taped for me last week. Only one was not a repeat which was just perfect for my break.</p>
<p>Kelly was on MSN for a bit; she has been ill with a nasty virus and is still not feeling great. She gave me the news that Hans has been offered a job with his old office... "Food and Agriculture" for the Liberal party. It may just last two years but it was good news; he will be out in the world again which is good for him, I think. Kelly asked if I would stay for the party they are having on Sunday afternoon, a crowd of 55 expected!. I will babysit for Gregg on Saturday night, as Kelly will be at a CM convention, and then will be there to help with prep' work on Sunday morning. She may drive me to the Falls on Monday and all four children would be with us, so that will be fun.</p>
<p>Chatted with Gail for a bit on Skype again; she and Tom are on their way out for a walk, I ate a perfect dinner for me... sauteed, pre- baked tofu, and a big mound of spinach lightly steamed on top of it, and then served with a nice generous slice of French goat cheese that I must use up before leaving. It was <strong>so</strong> good and I enjoyed every bite of it.</p>
<p>And then it was time to tackle the laundry room. I can't bear to come home to it, and it has been on my mind for a couple of weeks now. I worked away at it non-stop except for another little chat with Gail, back from a two hour walk. And now, I am happy to report, I have a very clean, tidy, and much better organized laundry room. Some of the children's toys are on a rolling rack with three shelves, which will keep them together and still handy for them, the paper, paint, and brushes are on the top of another rolling stand. I somehow managed to part with dozens of cleaning cloths; I am taking Flylady to heart and realizing that I really truly do not need four or five dozen rags. Off to the SPCA they will go tomorrow!</p>
<p>Riku called to say his usual goodnight, when his Daddy is there to make the call for him. It's the highlight of my day, especially on the days that I haven't seen him. Tonight he told me he was reading "Babar", although I thought he was saying bubbles in his soft little voice. After I told him that Babar wears clothes, he told me that his daddy and mommy did too... Babar's that is! And of course it ended with the sweetest thing of all. I say "goodnight sweetheart" and he says it back to me. And then comes "I love you" and he loves me too! A kiss goodnight ends the call, after "see you tomorrow!".</p>
<p>And I am off to bed... too late once again. It's almost 11:30 p.m. and I shall no doubt be awake at 6:30, after turning out the light at midnight.</p>

Lynne says:<br />
it's very cute...<br />
bryn says:<br />
he was drawing this morning, and didn't want me to draw on the sheet<br />
Lynne says:<br />
now saying "What shall we make? Maybe you would like a hat? Maybe you would like this art?"<br />
bryn says:<br />
usually we just draw together<br />
Lynne says:<br />
He is going on and on... typing away to try to get it all<br />
bryn says:<br />
adorable<br />
bryn says:<br />
first time he's said "making art"<br />
Lynne says:<br />
"Maybe draw a circle?"<br />
Lynne says:<br />
first time i have heard this too<br />
bryn says:<br />
like his overalls?<br />
Lynne says:<br />
oh yes, but I like overalls a lot... he is asking me to come and work on his little chair<br />
Lynne says:<br />
Riku LOVES his little table (we bought it for him at IKEA recently)<br />
bryn says:<br />
that's awesome</p>
<p>OK.. here is a another new one for me... in the car coming home after dropping off Akane, Riku was chattering away to himself and making rolling motions with his hands... very busy<br />
Lynne says:<br />
and then he said to me "Riku speaking Japanese"!<br />
Lynne says:<br />
I repeated it to him, asking "You are speaking Japanese?" and he said "yes, Riku speaking Japanese".<br />
bryn says:<br />

bryn says:<br />
if he's talking gibberish, i'll sometimes say "are you speaking japanese?"</p>
<p>later still... </p>
<p>Lynne says:<br />
I'm fading fast here... off I go to tidy Riku's room. Today he helped me fold the two blankets he uses during his naps... he took one side and I took the other... he likes his room tidy.. interesting, but then so did you<br />
bryn says:<br />
he helped carry stuff up from the car<br />
Lynne says:<br />
Karyn said today that Riku looks so much like you! She thought it was his smile perhaps. Akane says more people are saying that too, although I see many of Akane's mannerisms in him lately<br />
bryn says:<br />
he carried the banana bread up.... wanted to participate<br />
Lynne says:<br />
he is a helper for sure...<br />
Lynne says:<br />
yes, that's what it is... he pulls up the chair to help cook, and today helped load up a bag with things for the baby!<br />
Lynne says:<br />
he is such a special little boy<br />
bryn says:<br />
i'm glad you think so!<br />
Lynne says:<br />
yeah, me and the universe!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/08/a_very_long_day_from_sf_to_tor.html">A Very Long Day... from SF to Toronto</a></h2>
								<p>Well, this has been a very long day... the children are now tucked in, and tomorrow will be a busy day for everyone. </p>
<p>Doug had set the alarm for 3:30 this morning, and since I didn't turn the light out until 10:30 last night, and then couldn't get to sleep for another half hour (remebering two things I had to take with me!) that alarm went off much too early! </p>
<p>We left the house at 4:20, five minutes later than we planned. This hour of the day it should have taken about 25 minutes to get to the Oakland airport, plenty of time to get through security at 5 a.m. on a weekend. Well, good plans and all of that... there were road closures leading all the way up to the bridge, with traffic being filtered down to <b>one</b> lane, and then not on to the bridge but back down on city streets, with traffic lights holding up hundreds of early commuters. What a disaster it was! </p>
<p>It took us fifty minutes to get on to the bridge, twenty minutes later than we thought we would be arriving at the airport; this was not good. Of course, there were so many others in the same situation as I was at the airport; everyone was late for their 6 a.m. and 6:30 flights. I missed my flight, as did the woman behind me, on the same flight, and we were both wait-listed on a flight going to Washington/Dulles instead of our original flight to Chicago. From there we were wait-listed on a flight to Toronto, with less of a chance of getting on that one. </p>
<p>Our flight left at 8 a.m., and I could only get a middle seat. However, I had a very interesting seat companion and, except for a little dozing when I first boarded, she filled me in on her very adventurous life... a widow early, raised five children on her own, took in several other children, and had just returned from a wonderful trip to Napa and a day spa with her eldest son. I must look into it; it was in Calistoga Springs, and is called "Golden Haven". For about $150 they had a double room suite, a mud bath (this and the following for them both!), mineral soak, a hot towel wrap, and a two-hour massage with aromatherapy, and several other relaxation techniques geared to the individual. By that point of the day, my neck muscles were ready for this! </p>
<p>I had bought a really delicious-sounding sandwich at Rainbow last night, to have for my "breakfast" on the no-meal service to Chicago. I had eaten a fruit bowl in the car on the way to the airport, a banana, and a thermos of hot chocolate (using up the last of the soy milk at home), but three hours later, after we took off, I was more than ready for something more. This was as good as it looked... a nice thick slice of marinated firm tofu, pesto on one side of a very tasty crusty bun, with lots of organic greens, and on the other side of the bread a sun-dried tomato spread. </p>
<p>By the time we landed in Washington, found the gate, and checked in, I was ready for the meal Akane had prepared for me... I ate one of her wonderful inari, my favourite of all the inari I have tasted, and all of the dish of noodles with mushrooms and seasoning. Yum! It was sheer pleasure to just sit and eat and not wander carrying my bag, looking for the least objectionable airport food to tide me over. </p>
<p>The woman who had also missed the Chicago flight sat beside me, and between us we called her contacts and mine to make sure that those in Toronto waiting for us knew we were going to be two plus hours late. However, I was very grateful when told that I had, as the next flight didn't leave until 9:45 p.m., five hours later than this one! At one point I was told that I had to wait for the 9:45 as they wouldn't allow me to fly without my bags on the same plane. I asked them to check to see if they had flown them to Dulles with me, and after a tense twenty minutes I was told it was fine. I didn't ask any questions... </p>
<p>Our flight was delayed, as the crew out of Virginia was being held up due to bad weather conditions, and so the flight was about 35 minutes later than planned. We had to go outside to catch this flight, up the narrow metal stairs (it was raining slightly but the air felt good) and I was surprised to find a very small plane with just two seats in two rows; I was in row 12, the last seat on the left side of the plane. It has been a long while since I was in such a small plane. I had another inari on this flight and then polished off the container of tofu, mushrooms, eggplant, and carrots that was also in my goodie bag from Akane! No pretzels for me; Caillie and Myk' were more than happy to eat the two bags I brought home with me. </p>
<p>Gregg and the children were waiting for me, and the children all came<br />
running up with big hugs and kisses! It was lovely to see them and they had lots to say on the way home. I told them the funny story about Gregory's (my friend Elizabeth's son) camping adventure in early July. </p>
<p>It's hot here! ... well, humid I guess, more than hot. Gregg brought in my bags, we had groceries to carry in, I greeted Manitou, and I did a little unpacking.</p>
<p>Reading time with Caillie, after Gregg went off to a party with friends. She was tucked in a little later than she should have been though... not a good babysitter tonight am I!, and then the boys and Myk' were tucked in later than ideal as well. However, they can sleep in tomorrow; they tell me<br />
they now sleep in 'til 8 or 9... guess they are approaching teenagehood! It doesn't seem that long since they were up at the crack of dawn...</p>
<p>The back yard has been freshly sodded and it looks just terrific! There is a new picnic table on the deck and it all looks very family and summer oriented! Tomorrow sixty-one people are expected for their annual end-of-summer barbecue, and we will no doubt be busy right up until 2 p.m. when it starts. </p>
<p>I am sitting here glowing... or sweating... and really feeling this humid humid air! All the children have asked for flat sheets to use on their beds, instead of comforters. The fan is going in Caillie's room, and we shall no doubt need it tonight. </p>
<p>It's now 10:30; Kelly should be home in a half hour or so from her weekend CM convention, so I'm away... downstairs to wash up a big pot the boys cooked up peach salsa in!.. and to get a big drink of cold water. I may just lose a few pounds in moisture here!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/08/from_toronto_to_niagara_falls.html">From Toronto to Niagara Falls</a></h2>
								<p>Caillie and I both woke at 8:30 this morning, but lay in bed for another thirty-five minutes, talking, while I drew pictures and numbers on her back for her to guess. She always remembers I did this with my sisters when I was a child, and always asks me at least once a visit to do this with her as well. Caillie took a turn on my back too, but mostly she loves it for herself. We had to get up before doing any reading today, as the plan was to leave for the Falls as early as possible. </p>
<p>I showered immediately, packed up my bag, and did as much of the kitchen cleanup as I could... washing the big bowls and platters, getting rid of some of the bottles, and then doing my part of clearing out the fridge by eating a huge portion of watermelon and drinking a large quantity of the juice left over from the makings for watermelon margheritas! </p>
<p>Of course, leaving is always later than we had hoped for, and we finally left the house closer to 11 a.m. Traffic was fairly light and we made good time to the Falls, stopping first to eat at Harvey's, and then heading downtown to the aviary exhibit on River Road. A friend of Kelly's had told me last night how worthwhile it was to visit and it certainly was! We all enjoyed it so much and spent longer there than we had planned to; there were so many wonderful birds to see, on three levels. Bry' kept track of the ones we could identify and all four children went in to the enclosed pen holding the lorikeets, to feed them. Caillie and Myk' were both nervous and had the birds taken off their arms and hands before they had finished eating, but the boys both enjoyed it so much, even when they crawled up and around their necks. </p>
<p>We got to Uncle Frank's about 3:30 p.m. and there was little time for everyone to visit with UF. They did each play him a tune on the litttle organ and we spent a bit of time chatting and taking photos too. They went back to Toronto and I went in to unpack in my room. What a lovely surprise to find a bouquet of fresh flowers awaiting my arrival, and the photo of UF and me that I sent to him last week, now framed and displayed on the dresser. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank had a small flooding incident on Friday, having left the bathroom tap running while he was out of the house for a few hours. We plan to get busy with that job tomorrow, but sat and caught up on our news over a cup of tea in the kitchen. UF suggested dinner at Lina Linguine's, knowing how fond I am of it, but it was 6:30 by the time we thought about dinner, and instead we stayed in town and went to a Boston Pizza. It really hit the spot; we shared a mushroom and green olive pizza, a combination that Mom and AR had introduced me to many years ago. Yum! We both enjoyed it thoroughly. </p>
<p>We came back home for our tea and had it sitting in the damp rec' room. This is where the flood damage is... the ceiling and a very damp rug. We read the two papers, and I called Marie at almost 11 p.m. while UF finished up his paper. He heard me telling Marie about having bought a bottle of port last week, when out with two couples at a wine tasting tour, and the next thing I knew I was being handed a very generous glass of delicious port! I had told UF about the port last week, and he had thoughtfully picked up a bottle for us to share. </p>
<p>We stayed up far too late, turning in at 1:30 a.m.! It's lovely to be "home" again.</p>

								<p>Well, that generous glass of port Uncle Frank poured last night certainly helped me sleep; I awoke at 9:30 this morning feeling well rested. I went into the shower immediately and when I finished UF called to me that there was a hot cup of tea awaiting me in my room. Lovely... such service! </p>
<p>Uncle Frank had slept in as well, although he had stayed up a little later, drinking a cup of Sleepytime tea and reading first. I joined him at the table for breakfast, cereal, toast, and orange juice, while we discussed how we would spend our day.</p>
<p>First order of business was to take care of the very damp basement. </p>
<p>UF went off to buy cleaning supplies for the rug, while I moved furniture and tried soaking up some of the water with a rug-shampoo machine. It wasn't working and UF did the hot tedious job of cleaning the rug with the machine. It is a hot humid day and it was very hard work. He let it soak in for a bit, and then we both worked at pulling it up once again with the machine. We did this off and on throughout the day, taking turns at running the machine. UF put two fans in the windows, and that seemed to be working very well indeed. </p>
<p>We stopped for lunch; I made toasted tomato sandwiches with Havarti cheese. UF thoroughly enjoyed his lunch, and told me so; I know that eating something that someone else has made makes any food taste better, and it was nice to see how much he appreciated such a small gesture. We kept busy at the drying-out project throughout the day, moving things around, stamping around on two flannel sheets we laid down, looking quite the pair as we did this. I thought how funny it would have looked if someone had peeked in the window at us. UF was stomping around the perimeter, moving toward the centre, while I marched up and down in a parallel pattern. It was quite effective though and did the trick. We did a little more moving around of furniture, got out the dehumidifier, and things are drying up nicely, if slowly. The high humidity isn't helping a bit. </p>
<p>Later on when we realized we were hungry, we headed out to Stamford Centre, deciding at the last minute on fish and chips. Lucky us! They had a Tuesday special on it and so we had two small orders of haddock and chips for just $4.25 instead of $6.25. We thought it would be more relaxing to eat at home, and so had take-out wrapped in the traditional way... in newspaper. </p>
<p>We went back home and moved more furniture around and started playing some old cassette tapes and CDs to decide on which to keep and which to toss. This was lots of fun, as many of the cassettes weren't labelled and it sometimes took a while to figure out just what we were listening to. Of course we had tea, and had to sit in the kitchen as the room downstairs is out of order, but we relaxed and the evening flew by. We had our port, of course, and read the papers, and despite our intention to get to bed early it was 2 a.m. when I turned out my light... although I didn't read for long!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/08/how_the_day_did_fly.html">How the Day Did Fly!</a></h2>
								<p>... and no wonder, since it started off so late; Uncle Frank and I both woke up at 10:30 a.m.! I haven't slept that late since going to England five years ago and succumbing to jet lag in a hotel room. Uncle Frank said that perhaps a glass of port, the Remedy Rescue drops, and the Sleepy Time tea were a little more sleep-inducing than was necessary! </p>
<p>We finished up our light breakfast just before the noon hour; UF thought this was good timing, since we could clear up the plates and start right in on our second meal of the day. </p>
<p>Instead we did a little work in the rec' room, emptying the almost full dehumidifier, moving furniture to a dry spot, and placing the fans in the windows. </p>
<p>I decided to go over to Beth's for a few games of cards, leaving UF to read the morning papers. Beth didn't have a child in the house today!, so we had three games of Aces and shared a big plate of watermelon. I had promised UF I would arrive home hungry so we could have lunch together; I got home at three p.m. to find him flat out on the floor sorting through the cabinets in the damp and breezy rec' room. He had accomplised so much in my absence, piling up more books to send elsewhere, as well as dozens of video tapes of TV shows, more cassette tapes, games, and children's books. I brought a big stack upstairs and then made our lunch; canned potato soup and a grilled cheddar cheese and tomato sandwich. Uncle Frank is so very appreciative of a homemade meal, and makes me feel as though I have really put myself out! For dessert, he had some jello I had made up yesterday, and we sat chatting over our tea. I pulled out the contents of a drawer in the living room, plus a big stack of Christmas cards from the past two years. UF went through those before we left the table. We worked together on upgrading his online address book, to make sure he had all the names and addresses he wanted. One more job off his list. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank had only one more cabinet to work through, and so he did that while I put the "do not keep" items into a big plastic container to go out on Friday morning. We were feeling quite good at the end of the day, as there is a big stack of items to leave the house. </p>
<p>It is quite a bit cooler today, down to a very comfortable 72F, much more to my liking, and with less humidity too. We decided to go off for some groceries, as I would really like to eat fewer dinners out. We stocked up on some basic supplies for the next week or so, and plan to go to another store tomorrow when their big sale starts... canned soups for UF, and red grapes, which we both like. </p>
<p>Neither of us was terribly hungry, but UF did feel like eating, so we went to the Mandarin Chinese Garden in the same plaza as the grocery store. UF had orange beef, a dish Gerry really likes, and I had mu shu vegetables, after a spring roll each to start. We had a small bowl of white rice, which I didn't need with my meal, and UF thoroughly enjoyed his dinner. We both have enough for another meal at home in the next day or so. </p>
<p>Garbage and recycling night, so that took some time to sort through, before coming in the house. We are both tired, despite our late awakening, and so have decided to go to bed earlier tonight. UF got on the computer while I washed up, and then I called Riku for the first time. It was lovely to hear that bright happy little voice; we had a very nice chat. He was in the dark cupboard and we decided his Daddy needs a flashlight so Riku can go in dark places with it. He loves this at our house and discovered lots of dark spots last week with his Grandpa. It was so sweet to hear that little "goodnight sweetheart" repeated after I said goodbye to him. </p>
<p>Spoke with Glenn today; he and Wendy are on their way to the trailer tomorrow, as are Candy and Rick. Ian, Sheldon, and Roy are going fishing for the weekend, so I will see most of my siblings during the upcoming week. </p>
<p>I was a little concerned about Gail, having not heard from her in five days, but had forgotten she and Tom were at the PNE; she sent off an email reminding me that I had known... </p>
<p>I phoned Riku tonight in time to say hello and we had a lovely little conversation. I miss him so much and it's so good to hear that voice of his. Bryn had told me about two blogs he had put up, his first in a long time, and that was just wonderful to both read and see. There were two photos with Akane and Riku up on them, so a double treat! </p>
<p>... and away I go. I've had my port, a slightly smaller glass tonight, and have taken my Rescue Remedy drops as well, since I gave some to UF tonight. I might even turn the light out before midnight tonight, and still get a little reading done first.</p>
