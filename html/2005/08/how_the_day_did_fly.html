								<h2>How the Day Did Fly!</h2>
								<p>... and no wonder, since it started off so late; Uncle Frank and I both woke up at 10:30 a.m.! I haven't slept that late since going to England five years ago and succumbing to jet lag in a hotel room. Uncle Frank said that perhaps a glass of port, the Remedy Rescue drops, and the Sleepy Time tea were a little more sleep-inducing than was necessary! </p>
<p>We finished up our light breakfast just before the noon hour; UF thought this was good timing, since we could clear up the plates and start right in on our second meal of the day. </p>
<p>Instead we did a little work in the rec' room, emptying the almost full dehumidifier, moving furniture to a dry spot, and placing the fans in the windows. </p>
<p>I decided to go over to Beth's for a few games of cards, leaving UF to read the morning papers. Beth didn't have a child in the house today!, so we had three games of Aces and shared a big plate of watermelon. I had promised UF I would arrive home hungry so we could have lunch together; I got home at three p.m. to find him flat out on the floor sorting through the cabinets in the damp and breezy rec' room. He had accomplised so much in my absence, piling up more books to send elsewhere, as well as dozens of video tapes of TV shows, more cassette tapes, games, and children's books. I brought a big stack upstairs and then made our lunch; canned potato soup and a grilled cheddar cheese and tomato sandwich. Uncle Frank is so very appreciative of a homemade meal, and makes me feel as though I have really put myself out! For dessert, he had some jello I had made up yesterday, and we sat chatting over our tea. I pulled out the contents of a drawer in the living room, plus a big stack of Christmas cards from the past two years. UF went through those before we left the table. We worked together on upgrading his online address book, to make sure he had all the names and addresses he wanted. One more job off his list. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank had only one more cabinet to work through, and so he did that while I put the "do not keep" items into a big plastic container to go out on Friday morning. We were feeling quite good at the end of the day, as there is a big stack of items to leave the house. </p>
<p>It is quite a bit cooler today, down to a very comfortable 72F, much more to my liking, and with less humidity too. We decided to go off for some groceries, as I would really like to eat fewer dinners out. We stocked up on some basic supplies for the next week or so, and plan to go to another store tomorrow when their big sale starts... canned soups for UF, and red grapes, which we both like. </p>
<p>Neither of us was terribly hungry, but UF did feel like eating, so we went to the Mandarin Chinese Garden in the same plaza as the grocery store. UF had orange beef, a dish Gerry really likes, and I had mu shu vegetables, after a spring roll each to start. We had a small bowl of white rice, which I didn't need with my meal, and UF thoroughly enjoyed his dinner. We both have enough for another meal at home in the next day or so. </p>
<p>Garbage and recycling night, so that took some time to sort through, before coming in the house. We are both tired, despite our late awakening, and so have decided to go to bed earlier tonight. UF got on the computer while I washed up, and then I called Riku for the first time. It was lovely to hear that bright happy little voice; we had a very nice chat. He was in the dark cupboard and we decided his Daddy needs a flashlight so Riku can go in dark places with it. He loves this at our house and discovered lots of dark spots last week with his Grandpa. It was so sweet to hear that little "goodnight sweetheart" repeated after I said goodbye to him. </p>
<p>Spoke with Glenn today; he and Wendy are on their way to the trailer tomorrow, as are Candy and Rick. Ian, Sheldon, and Roy are going fishing for the weekend, so I will see most of my siblings during the upcoming week. </p>
<p>I was a little concerned about Gail, having not heard from her in five days, but had forgotten she and Tom were at the PNE; she sent off an email reminding me that I had known... </p>
<p>I phoned Riku tonight in time to say hello and we had a lovely little conversation. I miss him so much and it's so good to hear that voice of his. Bryn had told me about two blogs he had put up, his first in a long time, and that was just wonderful to both read and see. There were two photos with Akane and Riku up on them, so a double treat! </p>
<p>... and away I go. I've had my port, a slightly smaller glass tonight, and have taken my Rescue Remedy drops as well, since I gave some to UF tonight. I might even turn the light out before midnight tonight, and still get a little reading done first.</p>
