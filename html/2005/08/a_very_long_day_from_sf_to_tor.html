								<h2>A Very Long Day... from SF to Toronto</h2>
								<p>Well, this has been a very long day... the children are now tucked in, and tomorrow will be a busy day for everyone. </p>
<p>Doug had set the alarm for 3:30 this morning, and since I didn't turn the light out until 10:30 last night, and then couldn't get to sleep for another half hour (remebering two things I had to take with me!) that alarm went off much too early! </p>
<p>We left the house at 4:20, five minutes later than we planned. This hour of the day it should have taken about 25 minutes to get to the Oakland airport, plenty of time to get through security at 5 a.m. on a weekend. Well, good plans and all of that... there were road closures leading all the way up to the bridge, with traffic being filtered down to <b>one</b> lane, and then not on to the bridge but back down on city streets, with traffic lights holding up hundreds of early commuters. What a disaster it was! </p>
<p>It took us fifty minutes to get on to the bridge, twenty minutes later than we thought we would be arriving at the airport; this was not good. Of course, there were so many others in the same situation as I was at the airport; everyone was late for their 6 a.m. and 6:30 flights. I missed my flight, as did the woman behind me, on the same flight, and we were both wait-listed on a flight going to Washington/Dulles instead of our original flight to Chicago. From there we were wait-listed on a flight to Toronto, with less of a chance of getting on that one. </p>
<p>Our flight left at 8 a.m., and I could only get a middle seat. However, I had a very interesting seat companion and, except for a little dozing when I first boarded, she filled me in on her very adventurous life... a widow early, raised five children on her own, took in several other children, and had just returned from a wonderful trip to Napa and a day spa with her eldest son. I must look into it; it was in Calistoga Springs, and is called "Golden Haven". For about $150 they had a double room suite, a mud bath (this and the following for them both!), mineral soak, a hot towel wrap, and a two-hour massage with aromatherapy, and several other relaxation techniques geared to the individual. By that point of the day, my neck muscles were ready for this! </p>
<p>I had bought a really delicious-sounding sandwich at Rainbow last night, to have for my "breakfast" on the no-meal service to Chicago. I had eaten a fruit bowl in the car on the way to the airport, a banana, and a thermos of hot chocolate (using up the last of the soy milk at home), but three hours later, after we took off, I was more than ready for something more. This was as good as it looked... a nice thick slice of marinated firm tofu, pesto on one side of a very tasty crusty bun, with lots of organic greens, and on the other side of the bread a sun-dried tomato spread. </p>
<p>By the time we landed in Washington, found the gate, and checked in, I was ready for the meal Akane had prepared for me... I ate one of her wonderful inari, my favourite of all the inari I have tasted, and all of the dish of noodles with mushrooms and seasoning. Yum! It was sheer pleasure to just sit and eat and not wander carrying my bag, looking for the least objectionable airport food to tide me over. </p>
<p>The woman who had also missed the Chicago flight sat beside me, and between us we called her contacts and mine to make sure that those in Toronto waiting for us knew we were going to be two plus hours late. However, I was very grateful when told that I had, as the next flight didn't leave until 9:45 p.m., five hours later than this one! At one point I was told that I had to wait for the 9:45 as they wouldn't allow me to fly without my bags on the same plane. I asked them to check to see if they had flown them to Dulles with me, and after a tense twenty minutes I was told it was fine. I didn't ask any questions... </p>
<p>Our flight was delayed, as the crew out of Virginia was being held up due to bad weather conditions, and so the flight was about 35 minutes later than planned. We had to go outside to catch this flight, up the narrow metal stairs (it was raining slightly but the air felt good) and I was surprised to find a very small plane with just two seats in two rows; I was in row 12, the last seat on the left side of the plane. It has been a long while since I was in such a small plane. I had another inari on this flight and then polished off the container of tofu, mushrooms, eggplant, and carrots that was also in my goodie bag from Akane! No pretzels for me; Caillie and Myk' were more than happy to eat the two bags I brought home with me. </p>
<p>Gregg and the children were waiting for me, and the children all came<br />
running up with big hugs and kisses! It was lovely to see them and they had lots to say on the way home. I told them the funny story about Gregory's (my friend Elizabeth's son) camping adventure in early July. </p>
<p>It's hot here! ... well, humid I guess, more than hot. Gregg brought in my bags, we had groceries to carry in, I greeted Manitou, and I did a little unpacking.</p>
<p>Reading time with Caillie, after Gregg went off to a party with friends. She was tucked in a little later than she should have been though... not a good babysitter tonight am I!, and then the boys and Myk' were tucked in later than ideal as well. However, they can sleep in tomorrow; they tell me<br />
they now sleep in 'til 8 or 9... guess they are approaching teenagehood! It doesn't seem that long since they were up at the crack of dawn...</p>
<p>The back yard has been freshly sodded and it looks just terrific! There is a new picnic table on the deck and it all looks very family and summer oriented! Tomorrow sixty-one people are expected for their annual end-of-summer barbecue, and we will no doubt be busy right up until 2 p.m. when it starts. </p>
<p>I am sitting here glowing... or sweating... and really feeling this humid humid air! All the children have asked for flat sheets to use on their beds, instead of comforters. The fan is going in Caillie's room, and we shall no doubt need it tonight. </p>
<p>It's now 10:30; Kelly should be home in a half hour or so from her weekend CM convention, so I'm away... downstairs to wash up a big pot the boys cooked up peach salsa in!.. and to get a big drink of cold water. I may just lose a few pounds in moisture here!</p>
