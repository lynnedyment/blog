								<h2>A Cold Day and a Dunk in a Pool</h2>
								<p>It's 9 p.m and Riku is tucked soundly into bed. He fell asleep quite quickly after his tub time and tuck-in at 7:45, but managed to wrap his arms tightly around my neck making it very difficult to extricate myself from his grip, even after he fell asleep. </p>
<p>Our day started at 7:15 this morning, with a little boy prying my eyelids open; usually he just puts his face about three inches from mine, until I feel it there subconciously, but I suppose after my late to bed at midnight this wasn't working for him. His Daddy prepared him a bowl of mandarin orange segments, and I made him a piece of toast to get him through his "first breakfast" of the day. He had a dentist appointment at 9:30, so had a scrambled egg and a side dish of tomatoes before leaving for the five minute trip downstairs to the dentist. </p>
<p>What a successful visit this was, despite Riku's disappointment that there were no toys in the front office. However, he settled for a few stories instead until we were called in. Riku sat on his own in the chair, and expected to have the bib around his neck. I think he was surprised when the gal tipped his chair back, but he was relaxed and nothing fazed him at all. She had him rinse and spit and then chose orange as his choice of flavour for the floride treatment, and then just spitting when that was finished. The male dentist then came in and checked his teeth thoroughly, using the pick and mirror. I managed to get a few photos during this session and am so glad I took my camera along. </p>
<p>It was a very cold day here but the sun was shining so he and I headed off to the park across the street. There were no children there when we arrived, so Riku had the chance to mess up the neatly raked sand in the sandbox. He drew big circles in it with the edge of his shoe and seemed mighty pleased with the results. He went up and down the slides a few times, and then asked me to take a turn. I think we went up and down ten or more times, after Riku decided it was much more fun to take turns being first, with the other hanging on to the coat in front! </p>
<p>I got cold pretty quickly, so we headed in the direction of the condo, when I spotted a thin layer of ice on one of the two long very shallow pools of water in the rose garden area. We couldn't find a stick to poke through it and decided to go home and get one from the basket in the front hall. However, we lucked out and found one right at the crosswalk, so back we went. I showed Riku how he could poke it in the ice, and he went right to it. However, he was a bit too close to the slightly higher edge so I moved him back. He was still a bit close and just as I went to move him back again, he leaned forward and in he went! I'm sure he was startled, as the water was obviously very cold, but I had him out and in my arms in seconds. Brrr! I carried him right home, with his shoes and pants and jacket dripping water all the way. </p>
<p>I immediately got him out of his wet clothes, into nice warm dry ones, and made him a cup of hot chocolate. He thought it was quite an adventure, and brought up his "accident" a few times during the day. </p>
<p>Akane left at 12:30 to meet her mom, Bryn was busy working, and after Riku had his lunch, off he went for an early nap. He slept from 1-3:45 but still woke up a little out of sorts. Bryn picked him up, wrapped a light blanket around him and he snored against Bryn's chest for about fifteen minutes, finally coming 'round. Snacks, and lots of playtime followed. He had a grand time being "Dr. Dyment" (he now calls himself this whenever he gets his kit out), using the stethoscope, giving me a needle, checking my blood pressure, and taking my temperature. He also combed my hair for me and was very gentle doing so. </p>
<p>Akane came home with food for the adults; she had bought four little dishes of vegetarian goodies for me and I immediately had two of them... four pieces of tofu, and a dish of bright greens with slivers of tofu. I know that a lotus root dish awaits me tomorrow, as well as one other, as I managed to resist scarfing them all down tonight. </p>
<p>Riku ate noodles with veggies for dinner and quite enjoyed his tiny cone filled with raspberry cream gelato earlier in the afternoon. He ate lots of fruit today, which he loves... half a banana, two big strawberries, two mandarin oranges, and some apple slices. </p>
<p>We are trying to convince Riku to have his BMs in the toilet, but he just postpones having it until his diaper is back on. Today as usual, he went to our bedroom, shut the door, and told me he "Riku needs privacy"; if you try to go in he will hold up two fingers and say very seriously, "just two minutes". After this happened today, and he was changed, I told him this wasn't to happen anymore. His dad was there too, telling him he had to go to the toilet, and not in the bedroom. Then I started fooling around with him, telling him I was going to go to the bedroom and have a BM. He thought this was pretty funny, tried to come into the room, but I leaned against it, just as he does and told him "just two minutes". Of course he was telling me I had to go in the bathroom! And then Bryn went through the same routine after which Riku told him to come in the other room to have his diaper changed! It was hilarious; Bryn was down on the bed with his legs in the air, Riku was pretending to pull the diaper off, wipe him, and pat him. Why I didn't get the camera out I have no idea, except that is was just too funny to miss a minute of! </p>
<p>Tomorrow my plan is to get that diaper off him as soon as breakfast is over, as I know he won't want to lose control without a diaper on. He's ready for taking this next big step for sure, as he came home from school yesterday and immediately went to the bathroom. He also now tells me when "urine coming out!" so the awareness is there too. </p>
<p>Okay, this blog isn't short at all but they will be, they will! I just need days with no children in them... </p>
<p>... and no, Akane is not feeling any urges to push. I am now getting worried, as I am six days from leaving here. Baby Mirei, we want to see you very very soon!</p>
