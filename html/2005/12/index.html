								<h2><a href="/2005/12/first_full_day_in_japan.html">First Full Day in Japan</a></h2>
								<p>Riku and I both awoke at 6:45 this morning. Riku rolled over, checked to see that my eyes were open, and then gave me the biggest morning grin a person could hope for. He had a good night's sleep, although he coughed off and on, and he was having trouble breathing. We lay there for about ten minutes chatting and reading the book we had read last night, "Where's Nicky?", a new lift-the-flap book featuring one of his favourite book characters. Today was a school day, so I put out Riku's breakfast of choice... "circles", two halves of a banana (one of which was mine but he ate both!), a cup of his old favourite juice here (a vegetable and fruit mixture), and three quarters of a piece of toast. We had a little play time before it was time to get dressed and leave.</p>
<p>Riku wasn't happy at the prospect of going to school; he said "no teacher, no school" and when I asked him if he would show me his school, he agreed that he would, but followed that statement by saying he wouldn't go in. Guess he just intended to wave a hand at it as we went by! Akane was carrying a new mini-futon and cover for his nap time, and I went along to see his school, with Riku protesting all the short way along that he wasn't going.</p>
<p>By the time we had climbed up the stairs, Riku was in tears and wanted holding. The other children were in the playground on the main level, and we wandered around the spacious and bright room on our room, with Riku reluctantly showing me the toys. We went into the napping area and both lay down on the floor; it felt nice and cozy and Akane unpacked his bedding and put it in the cupboard. He came around at this point and we went back out into the main room, when one of the teachers came up and suggested we go down to the playground. Protesting right up to getting his shoes back on, we went down to join the few other children in his group, and reluctantly Riku showed me the big rubber funnels and flower pots; before long he was happily digging in the sand and making cakes. I told him we had to go to the bank; his response was "You coming right back?" but I told him we would be back later. One funny thing happened while we were in the playground; a couple of the other childen heard Riku calling me "Nana" and so two of them called me that as well to get my attention. Very cute.</p>
<p>Akane and I strolled back to the condo, a mere five minutes away, and tried unsuccessfully to go the bank. Someone was in the booth for a long time and another person was waiting, so we gave up for now. I ate some oatmeal earlier in the morning and had a piece of toast with peanut butter (I brought it with me), and then got busy unpacking. This took a good long while; I got out the several books for Riku, some old favourites like "Small Pig" and a couple of Caillou books he got for his  birthday, but read only once or twice before leaving for Japan. My clothes are sorted and in place in my room, the food in the cupboards, and the suitcases stored away in the storage room at the front of the unit. Bryn was busy working away and Akane went off with Ayako at 11:30 to spend Ayako's day off together.</p>
<p>Bryn wasn't feeling well; he had cramps in his stomach and was only comfortable lying down. I was sitting reading at the table, got squirmy after a bit and decided to lie down on the futon in the tatami room. I may have read for ten minutes and awoke three hours later! I was very surprised at this since I had fallen asleep last night no later than 10:30 and had slept very well. I didn't feel groggy after I woke, so I must have needed it to cope with the jet lag I wasn't aware of. Bryn went to bed as well, and since the computer was in his room, I didn't get on until later. I knew my sisters and Doug would be checking to see how the trip was too, but I knew Bryn's computer wouldn't be available. Akane's was in the bedroom as well but I wasn't tracking well enough to have thought to have Bryn bring it out for me.</p>
<p>Bryn and I had time for a chat catching up on my New Year's plan, and various other bits of information we haven't had time for the past couple of weeks. Kelly had told him they wouldn't be giving up the puppy after all, so that was good news. I knew that was going to be so hard on the children. Before we knew it, Akane was home and it was time to pick up Riku. We all went over and Riku was playing in what Bryn says is his usual spot, the little kitchen. Riku was busily stirring up a pot of something delicious and took time to look up and beam at us, and get right back to it. A few minutes later we were on our way home, walking a bit through that old familiar park across the way.</p>
<p>Riku was a happy boy to get home; he and I came right to the apartment while Akane and Bryn went to the grocery store first. Riku spotted the doctor kit I brought from home, and immediately started taking my temperature, checking my heart, ears, and blood pressure, and giving me a needle after first cleaning it with cotton puffs. I added these to the kit and he just thinks they are the greatest addition to his kit. I must say that Dr. Dyment sounds awfully good to both his mom and me, and I am sure his dad too. </p>
<p>After dinner he had a little time for Play-Doh and books, and then it was tuck-in time for a very tired little boy. I tucked him in at 7:30 but ended up staying in the room with him until 8:15; he was restless, not talking but not finding it easy to settle down either. I read my emails but went to bed at 10 p.m., when Riku woke up calling for me.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/12/to_osaka.html">To Osaka</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke a half hour before Riku this morning; he rolled over to put his hands on my face at 7:15, a nice long sleep. He didn't cough at all last night and only started sounding stuffy in the hour before he woke up. Once awake, however, he had some hard coughs, which Bryn said are typical in the mornings, and he's pale, despite the long sleep. </p>
<p>He ate a good breakfast of porridge, 1/2 banana, 3/4 of a piece of toast, and some veg/fruit juice, which was reassuring. I decided not to go to school with him this morning; he was protesting from the time he woke up, and I don't want to possibly be making it worse by being there. Bryn and Akane walked him over today but Bryn said he cried for them as well, which wasn't fun to know but at least I know it wasn't me making it harder for him. Riku asked one of the teachers to hold him, and she was as they left him. </p>
<p>I Skyped with Doug, wrote an email to my sisters, and made myself some hot chocolate and toast for breakfast. Akane and Bryn had gone out for a quick breakfast at a tiny local cafe and when they arrived home we decided we would spend a few hours in Osaka this afternoon. I went through the last of the magazines I had brought with me, while Bryn worked and Akane was on her computer. Now I wish I had brought a dozen or more of the magazines as I have so many to go through and so little time at home. </p>
<p>We caught the 1:06 train to Namba, one of the huge and bustling shopping areas in Osaka. Our first stop was at the Canadian Consulate to get the paper work for Mirei Elizabeth before her birth. We had to wait twenty minutes for someone to get back from lunch hour and Bryn managed to find their names in the guest book from three years ago for Riku's passport visit. It was three years and one day from today. When the clerk returned, Bryn got an envelope stuffed with all that is required to get the baby started toward her Canadian passport. </p>
<p>Bryn and I both wanted to wander through Uniglo, a very reasonably priced clothing store with great quality clothing, a somewhat rare combination here. Bryn buys all his jeans, tshirts, socks and underwear here, and some of Riku's clothes are purchased here as well. I needed more time than we had, but did buy a very lightweight turtleneck top, for $10, and had a good look at some two-piece top and slacks outfits for Caillie to replace the ones that didn't fit for her birthday gifts. </p>
<p>I went to the restroom in the store and saw a new feature on the toilet there... a button you push that sounds like a flushing toilet but is really just camoflage for any indiscreet noies one might make! It was certainly very authentic sounding and worth a photo too, which I took.</p>
<p>I would have liked to wander around the store much longer, but we had to pick Riku up at school at 5 p.m. and needed to get moving. There will be other chances. Off we went to get some wonderful basil french fries I remembered from three years ago. They weren't making them anymore but we chose some "butter" fries which came with various toppings, Bryn and Akane both had a sandwich with theirs and I was to share Bryn's and ordered myself a small margherita pizza. None of it was wonderful and even though I ate every bite of my pizza and polished off the end of the fries, we decided we wouldn't go back there again. I should have eaten a more substantial breakfast or not waited so long for lunch; once I'm hungry all discretion goes out the window! </p>
<p>We dashed to get back to Riku and made it in lots of time. He was busy playing happily with the little kitchen, his favourite spot of all, and even though he was glad to see us he played for a few more minutes before getting ready to leave. Once out the door though it was obvious that he was just wiped out. Bryn and Akane decided to go in and talk to the staff to see if there was a possibility of arranging his days so that he doesn't have two days back to back. With eight-hour days, it might make him happier to have a day in between to be at home with a less active day. </p>
<p>While they were talking to the teacher, Riku and I waited in the park. It was getting dark, but we were wandering about, and ran into one of the twins from my visit last May... Yui, with her big brother. It was such fun to see her again, and before long Aya came along too. We had a nice little reunion before Akane and Bryn joined us. We introduced them to Bryn too, and off we went for home. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane went to the store downstairs, and I came up with Riku to get him fed immediately. Dinner was on the table for him in less than ten minutes, and then it was story time and tuck-in.   </p>
<p>Bryn assured Riku when they came home that he would not be going to school for two and maybe three days as... and at this point he asked Riku what day it was tomorrow, to which Riku responded "it's the weekend!" not long after Akane and Bryn left to meet Ayako downstairs.</p>
<p>They are all off for a steak dinner, won by Ayako in a contest. The restaurant is in one of the biggest hotels in Sakai City and it was pretty good, but not excellent. </p>
<p>I finally got another blog written, although Riku woke up a couple of times, so I got into my pajamas early and washed so I could just crawl in with him when it was my bedtime too. Riku coughed a bit when he first went to bed, but was fine the rest of the evening. Bedtime at 11 p.m. after Akane and Bryn returned home; we had time to catch up on our news before saying goodnight.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/12/its_the_weekend.html">"It's the Weekend!"</a></h2>
								<p>Riku and I both woke up this morning at 6:50; he is so sweet in the mornings when he first awakens. He rolls over and puts his hands on my face and smiles at me, until I say "good morning". Then he starts to chat, and rolls over me to get whatever book we read the night before. Pulling the curtain aside he waits for me to say "too bright!" at which point he giggles and then we start to read. </p>
<p>Bryn was working at the dining room table when we got up at 7:10 or so. He asked Riku, "Is today a school day?" to which Riku replied "It's the weekend" and sure enough, it is. Riku started off his day with Play-Doh, making little bits of it with a plastic knife, and poking holes into it with a tiny chopstick and a wooden dowel. His parents are not keen about this activity since it lands on the upholstered chairs but he is such a fan of it. We've decided we need to cover the chair or make it disappear until we are back in SF. </p>
<p>It has been three full days for Riku without a BM, unheard of for this boy, so I was determined it was going to happen today. While he was playing I served up a full mandarin orange, a slice of whole wheat toast, and a cup of veggie/fruit juice. This seemed to do the trick, as Riku disappeared into the bedroom and shut the door. Bryn decided we wouldn't suggest the toilet this morning, as we think this discouraged activity last night. (I am trying to be discreet here about a personal topic!). Alas, it was not a successful venture, and he joined us again a few minutes later. A few more bites of toast and ten minutes later we were all cheering his success. Whew! </p>
<p>Kei, the gal I met here in May, had been in touch with Akane yesterday via computer, too unsure of her English to talk to me on the phone. She and Tomoha were available for a visit in the park today for a meeting, and we were to be there at 10 a.m. I quickly showered, dressed, and fed Riku a few bites of the oatmeal I had asked Akane to prepare for him. </p>
<p>Despite his good sleep last night, Riku seemed not really rested, and was a bit grumbly about the meeting. Turned out that Tomoha was feeling quite shy, and that did the trick, as Riku was the one who warmed up first. They went over to the slide immediately and flew down a few times, and while Kei and I managed as best we could in her English and my no Japanese, they children played together. They climbed up the little hill, collected a few rocks, although Riku was not at all happy when she helped herself to one of his. He had them in a little baggie I found in my purse, and they were his!</p>
<p>I suggested at one point that we go to play in his school playground as it is open to the public today; there were lots of children there. However, Riku would have none of it; he said "no school, no playground" even though I assured him we were just going to play.  </p>
<p>We were eventually joined by an old acquaintance of Kei's, a classmate from kindergarten! and her three year old daughter. The three children played very well together in a little stand of trees, especially when the other mom chased them and saying "boo" when she came upon them. I had forgotten my camera! and whenever Kei tried to get a photo Riku up and left the scene. Both girls were determined to sit beside him at one point; it was funny to watch. Riku would wander off on his own and sit down on a little ledge. Tomoha would wander over and sit next to him and the other little girl on the other side of him. Up he would get and move on and it would start all over again. The visit went in spurts like this, with some running and fun, and then with Riku choosing not to play. It was chilly when the sun went behind the clouds and we both agreed we would meet again on Tuesday in the park. Tomoha was tired too, just as determined to hold on to the stick she took from Riku, as he was to have it. Eventually he traded her a bigger stick for it, and off we went waving goodbye.</p>
<p>Riku had an appointment to get his hair cut today at 3:30 p.m. It was the perfect plan; Riku would nap from approximately 12:30-2:30 and be awake long enough before the cut to not mind having his hair cut. Well.. the best laid plans, as they say... he ate his bowl of oatmeal for lunch, had another orange, and Akane and I left with a very tired boy for the 1:43 train. Riku fell asleep almost immediately on the train, just as we planned, and then woke up as soon as we got into the underground mall to go to the area we needed to get to. It was jam-packed with shoppers on every street, with lots of loud advertising, Christmas music being played at top volume, and no chance at all that Riku would sleep through it, without a good half hour nap under his belt first. It was frustrating as he was already overtired and we still had two hours before his appointment. </p>
<p>Akane walked me over to Uniglo to do some shopping I wanted to do, and she went to a quieter department store hoping that Riku would sleep for her then. But that plan failed too, and when she picked me up Riku was still awake. Bryn met us at 3 o'clock, after working until 2 p.m. (it's Friday in SF and a work day for him) and we headed over to the hairdressers after I fed Riku a yogurt and some snacks. Akane had given him two madeleines too, so he had a full tummy. </p>
<p>I thought the hair cut was going to be a total disaster as by this time it was so obvious that Riku was overtired. He was not a happy boy at the thought of getting his hair cut. Akane instructed the gal how she wanted it done, and they left saying they would be back in a half hour. Unfortunately, the appointment was stretched out a half hour late!, and I read to Riku in between bouts of his saying he didn't want to get his hair cut. </p>
<p>Thank goodness, it went well. I sat on the chair and got a cape on, with Riku on my lap with his towel and cape on too. Fortunately, looking at himself in the mirror is one of Riku's favourite things to do, so he managed to forget, for the most part, that he wasn't happy sitting there with hair falling into his mouth and eyes. I fed him bites of the tiny Toblerone bar I had been given on the plane and that was a diversion too. Akane and Bryn came in, watched the action for a few minutes, and after Bryn took a few photos of us, left for another walk around the area. Riku looked very handsome and like a regular little person with his new haircut. Akane had the gal cut his bangs a little bit shorter and Riku put up with yet more sitting very well. </p>
<p>Bryn suggested Akane and I go off to a big department store to buy the two little toys he had promised Riku for being co-operative with his cut, while he walk Riku around the block a few times to get him to sleep. Riku's eyes were almost closed when we parted, but a half hour later, there they appeared, Riku sitting straight up in his stroller appreciating night time in the big city. The crowds of people are unbelievable! Bryn says it has nothing to do with the approaching Christmas season, but just the fact that there are so many people in Japan, and apparently a lot of them like to shop! </p>
<p>We did our part too, with a new police car and a new fire department vehicle for Riku, and four delicious-looking custards, which I purchased from my first-this-trip visit to the most amazing food floors they have here. I really love wandering around in any of these massive bottom floor food emporia; they are beautifully set up with incredible breads, dessert displays... more than a half dozen of each, as well as fish and meat areas, prepared foods, hawkers calling out their specialties... I love it, and wish my sisters could see this just once in their lives. </p>
<p>We decided once we met that it was time to head straight home with this tired little boy. He went from being so good to not-so-good on the way home on the train, walking happily with me along a very long corridor filled with glass blocks with interesting collections of various things in them... glass bottles, undersea fantasies, etc. to throwing his hat on the floor on the train. He wanted me to carry him on this portion of the trip, after Bryn had carried him on his shoulders through the bright streets aboveground. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane stopped on the way home for a dinner at Mos' burgers, while Riku and I came upstairs immediately to get Riku fed and ready for bed. It didn't take long; I heated up a good-sized bowl of mac' and cheese with veg' for him, and he ate while we read about "Frog and Toad". Bryn and Akane returned with an order of fries for us to share, a small portion here in Japan. Riku ate only one so I had to finish the rest off on my own. Surprisingly, Riku did not want more than about a half dozen tiny bites of his plain custard so that was the rest of my dinner. </p>
<p>By 7:30 the light was out in Riku's room, after a story and an extra drink of water for Riku. I love his acceptance of his night time routine here; he has his teeth brushed after he's in his PJs, says goodnight to his parents, steps up on his bed, lies down (tonight he propped his face up with his elbow and told me to "try it", then got back up to turn on his sound machine and said "Oh, I forgot to turn off the light!". I reminded him it would be very hard to read his story in the dark so on it went again and he settled in beside me. He's a bit restless these nights settling down... pulling aside the curtain, sticking his leg up in the air, but it didn't last long tonight, and neither did I. I think he was asleep by 7:45 and I crept out of the room at 8:35, much to my surprise. I don't usually doze off while tucking a child in. </p>
<p>Tomorrow we are heading for Kyoto on the 8:55 train, so I will get to bed at a decent hour tonight in preparation for a long day out. Kyoto is about a one and a half hour train ride, and I wonder if a little boy will nap that early on the way there. </p>
<p>Notes: Susan sent sweet photos through of Amelia today and also installed Skype so that Amelia and I could chat a little bit... oh, and others too!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/12/kyoto_the_hermitage_shisendo_a.html">Kyoto, the Hermitage Shisen-Do... and a Sick Boy</a></h2>
								<p>The plan for this morning was to take the 8:55 train to Kyoto. Riku had a good start as he awoke at 6:15, the earliest he has been awake since I arrived. I think he was too warm, as I had shut our window earlier this morning than usual. However, he was happy to just lie there quietly snuggling with me for another half hour, and then we got up. Bryn was already at the computer in the dining room, so while they had a little time together I popped right into the shower. I did check my email first, but didn't spend much time at it. </p>
<p>I wanted Riku to get rid of all the little hairs from his hair cut yesterday, but he didn't decide to join me in the shower until after I had already gotten out. However, I popped back in with him just to get his hair shampooed and the body hair free. We were quick at it though, as Akane too had to shower. </p>
<p>Riku ate some Os while playing on the floor with his daddy, plus some juice and a whole mandarin too. He was coughing a bit more this morning, in good spirits, although did say he would like to stay home and play. Tomorrow we shall do just that. Unfortunately, we missed the express train by one minute; Bryn was not happy about it, although the rainy grey day probably didn't help either. We ended up taking more trains but the advantage was that the last one was the first of the run so we had a guaranteed seat for the forty-five minutes to Kyoto. Before that last train we had time to stop for an "Egg McMuffin", the first I have had in a couple of years, and I enjoyed every bit of it. I had packed lots of snacks for our trip, plus some food for Riku, but hadn't eaten myself. </p>
<p>Riku was a bit out of sorts; it was obvious he was tired despite his nice early-to-bed night last night, and a good ten and a half hours of sleep, but he wanted me to hold him, and didn't want to go back in the stroller once he was out for a bite of breakfast. I was happy to hold him and once on the train he was asleep in my arms, in less than five minutes. The train was very crowded but Riku slept right through to the end of the line. It just wasn't long enough for his needs. </p>
<p>It was raining in Kyoto and we took a taxi to Shisen-Do temple, one of Akane's favourites in this city. Bryn carried Riku up the rough stone steps, and I parked the stroller at the top. After a few minutes Riku was willing to walk around for a bit, especially since there were puddles and some mud along the way. Bryn pointed out lots of interesting things to Riku... several lovely little waterways, a lovely stand of bamboo, a wooden bridge, and two ponds with fish in them. At one point, Bryn pointed out a loud clacking sound and asked Riku to find where it was coming from. He did so, after listening carefully, and found a hollowed out bamboo pole, filling with water, and then tipping onto a stone, carved out by millions of thuds of the end of the bamboo pole on it over the years.</p>
<p>This temple was built in the early 1500s and is a beautiful place. The gardens, even in the rain, were just lovely. A persimmon tree, bare except for some brilliant orange fruit, was set in the middle of a raked area, backed by mountains covered in fall foliage. We walked slowly from one spot to another and I took lots of photos. It was wonderful that Riku enjoyed it so much, as the rest of his day was not much fun for him. </p>
<p>As we were leaving Riku said to Bryn "Let's go home now". However, we were all hungry and ready for the tofu restaurant lunch that was planned for today. We took another cab, which Riku enjoyed very much, pointing out various things he noticed along the way, and then walked around for about twenty minutes trying to find this restaurant. It is just not meant to be; three years ago Bryn and I planned to go to it as well, and something came up and we had to change our mind. Ah well, one day... </p>
<p>Riku meanwhile was asking for noodles, so Akane managed to find us a nice, small local place where noodles were the main dish. Bryn and Akane chose a noodle and toful dish for me, Bryn's contained a well-known local fish, herring, and Akane had noodles with nori and we shared a small plate of tempura vegetables as well. I am not a fan of fish broth, and found Bryn's much too strong, but there was enough ginger in mine that it it was fishy, I didn't notice it. </p>
<p>Riku had changed his mind after eating a few noodles from both Akane's and my bowls, and instead ate some apple slices I had taken along, a half a container of yogurt, and orange juice, a drink he made clear he wanted. He also ate some "fish" crackers when we first sat down; he was obviously not feeling well at this point, he had a slight fever, and we were happy to have him sit with us and eat. By this stage he wanted only me to do anything with him... sit beside him, hold him while he ate, and accompany me to the bathroom too. Bryn decided we would head right home with him, while encouraging Akane to stay out and enjoy wandering around checking out the few things she had hoped to do today. </p>
<p>The rain had stopped so the walk to the train station was fine. Riku was happy to sit in the stroller and he was asleep five minutes after the train started. It was a forty-five minute trip, and another forty-five between waiting for the train home and getting to our station, Sakai-Shi.  </p>
<p>Riku was really burning up by the time we got in the house, and wanted nothing more than to snuggle up and lay quietly against me. He did tell me he was hungry though, and when Bryn asked what he wanted he came out with an egg, "bacon", toast and hot chocolate. He wasn't well enough to eat it all though; ate about half of the egg and toast, polished off the bacon and decided against the hot chocolate in favour of the veggie/fruit juice. He drank a lot of it, and it is a good thing, with the fever running.</p>
<p>At one point, I lay with him on the double futon in the tatami room, right next to where I sit typing in the dining room, and he was asleep within three minutes. He was whimpering, poor wee guy, but slept for a half hour or so. Up he got, climbed into a chair and watched some TV with his dad... a great show about children seeing how animals live in the forest, and just leaned in against him while I did some blogging. Riku also said he was hungry again, ate some of his "O"s cereal and drank lots of juice. </p>
<p>His fever got a little higher with his legs and arms quite hot, but now, at 9:30, Bryn says his arms and legs seem a touch on the cool side. His face, neck, and body are still warm, and I am prepared to give him a little bit of crushed Tylenol in the night if he is too uncomfortable. I would prefer not to, naturally, and let it run its course, knocking out whatever bug is making him sick. Akane came home about nine; she enjoyed her afternoon and evening out, which is wonderful, as there will soon be a little girl keeping her busy.  Both Akane and Riku will see their doctors tomorrow. Shall keep you all posted. I can hear him struggling a bit again, so shall close off for tonight.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/12/monday_an_in_the_house_with_ri.html">Monday... an In the House with Riku Day</a></h2>
								<p>Riku awoke in great spirits this morning, at 7 a.m., despite having a hot little body burning with fever up until about 5 a.m. He was happy to lie there for a bit, chatting to me and to his "dog", and then up we got. I expected it to be later and to find both Akane and Bryn awake, but they were snuggled in for just a few minutes longer. </p>
<p>Riku was hungry and had a big bowl of dry "O"s, a mandarin orange, and some juice. He played with Play-Doh and watched a children's TV program while I showered. Akane told us it was a very cold day out there today; they were even predicting snow! We bundled up, as Akane is off to see her doctor later on and to run some errands. Riku and I planned to spend the day at home. </p>
<p>We were lucky enough to do a little Skyping with Bryant and Kelly, and a tiny bit with Bryn as well. They are keeping their new little dog for a bit longer to see if she will look too obviously part bull terrier or not. Riku said hello to Bry' and Auntie Kelly; Gregg told me that Caillie had made a remarkable recovery from her pneumonia, diagnosed last Friday, and that I would be there for the annual sugar cookie gathering after all this year, as the children aren't out of school until the 23rd! I called Doug briefly as well, but we didn't have too much time before we had to get going. Nice to hear all these familiar voices though; I can't wait to talk to Amelia and see if she is going to feel too shy talking to a computer. I must get Doug to tell her about putting a photo up next to the name, as it does seem to make it easier for Riku to see who he is talking to. When he's at my house he can see Auntie Candy, or Gail, or Kelly. I like it too. </p>
<p>Akane and I were out the door with him at 9:25 to get to the nearby clinic to see a pediatrician... a female, and very popular. Riku has seen her once before, to have a check-up for his school enrollment, and Akane had liked her very much. The place was packed to the rafters with sick children and their mommies; runny noses and coughs seemed to be the main symptoms, although there were two very sick little ones waiting to be seen to. Riku seemed well in comparison to most of them, but after an hour and twenty minutes of waiting he started to show the symptoms of not being well too. He lost interest in the toys and didn't want anyone strange to smile at him. Thank goodness we were seen shortly after that. </p>
<p>I liked the doctor very much; she runs her office very professionally, and was thorough and friendly. Riku had started saying he didn't want to see the doctor and wanted to go home, but once he saw her stethoscope, decided it was perhaps an interesting place to be. He smiled at her as she put it in various places on his front chest, and then as he expected, on his back too. She had him stick his tongue out and say "ah", albeit a very small "ah" and drew a little picture for us of his red and infected throat. His chest is clear, thank goodness, despite his infrequent but always-there cough these days, and his ears are clear as well. She sent us home with an antibiotic containing a decongestant as well, and some suppositories for fever, which I hope we won't have to use. They are for a very high fever of over 39 degrees; Akane and Bryn bought a thermometer tonight so we can check if need be. </p>
<p>It was bloody cold out for certain. I wore my long navy blue wool coat with the long scarf Bruni sent for Riku, and we bundled him up in his winter jacket, a hat and the hood all tied together with a scarf. He still buried his head in my shoulder on the eight minute walk over and back. </p>
<p>Ayako had picked Akane up at the clinic, and as soon as we got in I made Riku his lunch. He was very specific... "toast and bacon, no egg" and he ate every bite of it, as well as polishing off his "O's" and drinking lots of juice. He was to have his medicine after his meal, so I gave that to him and within twenty minutes, after doing a wonderful drawing, it was obviously nap<br />
time, an early one at 12:30. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the phone rang at 1 p.m. and startled him and it took a bit to get him asleep again. By this time the fever had returned, and it was hard for him to settle in immediately. I lay with him for a bit, gave him some water, and finally he went back to sleep for another hour and a half, waking slowly with the fever down and happy to be up and playing. He asked for some noodles and I made him a big bowl of udon noodles in soy broth, with spinach, carrots, and mushrooms all finely diced. He ate more than I expected him to so his appetite is still good, a great sign. </p>
<p>Bryn left at 2 p.m. to join Akane for some errands downtown, and Riku and I spent a happy afternoon together with more Play-Doh, drawing, snacks and a bit of TV, although except for a brief segment on animals there was nothing for him to watch. By the time his parents arrived home Riku was feeling almost completely normal, his happy self making an appearance, and ready for some balloon playing with his dad and with me. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn went out for groceries within an hour of arriving home; I fed Riku more snacks, we played with the tools in his toolbox, and soon Akane and Bryn were home with us.  </p>
<p>Akane had ordered a DVD for Riku on "Ultraman", a movie made in Japan back in 1972. Riku has a few of the newly released action figures and likes them so was quite interested in seeing him in action. It's violent in many places, with guns and fights, but Riku sat on my lap making lots of comments and asking questions. We talked about how it was like Hallowe'en and the men were in costumes, especially the big scary ones. </p>
<p>Riku ate a half bowl of porridge for dinner, half of a banana, another Fig Newton which was a hit this afternoon, and did some more drawing. I am so amazed at watching this little boy intent on his art. He sits so nicely, with his back straight, having laid all of his pencil boxes neatly around him... two sets from Akane and one from his Baa-ba. He chooses one, uses it, places it on his left side neatly alongside the others already used, and continues in this fashion until he has used them all. At least that is how it went both times today and I took photos of both of his "pieces". </p>
<p>Within a half hour of having his medicine, Riku was lagging, and so his Daddy brushed his teeth and read "Small Pig" to him in bed. I followed with one "Nicky" book, and he took a little longer than last night to fall asleep. Unfortunately, if he coughs it really disturbs him and looks as though it hurts him to do so. Perhaps it hurts his throat... </p>
<p>I called Kei tonight to cancel our plans for meeting in the park tomorrow; it would be too cold to spend much time with the children there anyway, even if Riku were well. We have plans to meet on Thursday, and perhaps we will all meet Kei's husband too, who is off work that day. </p>
<p>I did some emailing, wrote this blog up, worked on some knitting off and on during the day, and somehow it all flew by too quickly. I must get out to the gelato place soon, although it is not that appealing when it is so cold! I can hear the wind blowing madly outside as I write this... brrrr.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/12/cold_and_rainy_sakai_city.html">Cold and Rainy... Sakai City</a></h2>
								<p>Riku and I woke at 7 a.m. today. He was a happy boy, going into the kitchen to see his dad sitting at the table working. Bryn got his "O"s out, his favourite morning meal right now, and he watched his TV show while eating some toast and an orange. He has been peeling his own mandarins lately and does so by first sticking an index finger in the top, to start a hole (a la "he put in his thumb and pulled out a plum!") and then deftly peels and sections it. </p>
<p>I had a bit of Skype time with Myk' and Bry' this morning and it was lovely to have a little chat with them. They caught me up on some news... the puppy is doing well, although now barking in the night; their music concert went very well; and I am not going to miss the annual Dyment/Tilston/Feldmann sugar cookie decorating party after all, since school lets out for the holidays this year on the 23rd! This is quite a bit later than usual, but they don't return to school until the 9th of January. </p>
<p>Bryant told me he liked Island school even though he got in trouble from one of the teachers for talking too early in the morning; sounds like he was just the one who got caught, though. </p>
<p>Caillie was diagnosed with pneumonia last Friday but Gregg told me she had an amazing recovery over the next three days, which was good to hear. I spoke with Kelly briefly, and then with Doug who had been put on hold while I spoke with the Ontario crowd. They are harder to find in on any given day, given their crazy schedules, and three hours later than SF. </p>
<p>Kelly and I had some time to IM about Christmas gifts; there are so many wonderful and very inexpensive clothes to be found at one of Akane's and Bryn's favourite stores here... Uniqlo so this will make some gift shopping easy. </p>
<p>Susan sent some gorgeous photos of Amelia today, one lot taken in the rain the day before, and another series of shots taken at various times. Amelia is such a ham, and of course gets herself into such funny situations.</p>
<p>I had decided to get out for some fresh air and a walk today on my own, as I am feeling the lack of exercise these past few days. Riku, who was obviously not feeling well, didn't approve at all when I said I was going; he cried and said "Nana stay home. No going out." and so  I decided it was too cold anyway. It was very windy today and much colder than I expected it to be when I hung some laundry out on the balcony. </p>
<p>Akane was busy puttering about the apartment this morning and in the early afternoon. This is a good sign for the baby's arrival, as often that little "nest building" urge kicks in. We can only hope, as her doctor told her he will induce her once her due date arrives. Let's hope Mirei Elizabeth heard that and decides to come into the world on her own terms. </p>
<p>After Riku had taken his medicine, which contains a decongestant, it seemed to kick in and make it obvious that he needed an early nap. He decided he would nap with his mommy, and she was fine with that, but unfortunately it didn't happen. Bryn and I were at the computers in the dining room, could hear thumps of feet against the wall, chatting from a certain little person, a little crying, protests against being urged to sleep, and finally calling out for me. Of course I brook no nonsense and took him into his room, lay down with him, told him he was to go to sleep now, and after a few thumps and protests for me too, fell into a sleep. He napped an hour and a half and needed it. </p>
<p>Akane made him fried rice for his late lunch, full of finely chopped veggies, and he ate a good-sized portion of it. It's great that despite feeling so tough Riku has been eating well throughout it all. </p>
<p>About 3 p.m. we all headed off to the gelato place I discovered in May. Akane had been a few days before I arrived, and told the owner I would be here soon, and I fully intended to get there before now. Akane was reluctant to go with us, as she had been busy in the house with the cooking and laundry too, but Bryn talked her into it. We went outside to discover it had started to rain, but lightly, so we continued on. It's only a fifteen minute walk, and of course because of the rain it was milder than it had been earlier. It was most pleasant, and Riku enjoyed it too, looking at the interesting things along the way that he spotted... like the cow-looking spots on a building! </p>
<p>The gal behind the counter recognized me when we walked in, and let the owner know we were there. He came out with a nice big smile to greet me; took my hand and shook it and placed his other hand on top... accompanied of course by a bow as well. He did the same with Bryn when I introduced him and then we each set about the business of choosing a flavour. After many offers of various new and familiar gelatos we were ready with our order; I had marscapone with black beans... sounds strange I know but it was really delicious, Bryn had mango, Akane had strawberry, and Riku chose vanilla with chocolate bits. He didn't like the big pieces of frozen chocolate though and passed them on to his dad when they were "too crunchy!" </p>
<p>I took some photos of Riku, Akane, and Bryn eating their little cups of gelato, sitting side by side on the long bench. Then the owner took  mine with them, and I coaxed him into posing for a photo with me, something I was sorry I didn't do in May. He promised he would make coconut gelato for me for tomorrow... what a lovely man! Not only did he remember how much I liked it, but isn't even going to make me wait too long for it. Riku sat like a little treasure, daintily eating tiny bites of his, asking "would you like to taste mine?" of his Mommy, Daddy, and me, and then happily tasting bites of ours too. "This is delicious!" he exclaimed when he tasted mine, but chose not to taste one of the soft black beans. </p>
<p>The rain had pretty much stopped on the way home and we all agreed it had been good to get out. Bryn and Akane stopped for a few groceries, and Riku and I came up on our own. He spent a long time drawing today, making the most beautiful stack of colours and also playing with his fire station while watching the evening children's show on TV. </p>
<p>Akane made a delicious dinner for us of mixed vegetables in light sauce, served with rice. It was great and a small bowl was perfect after having had dessert first tonight. </p>
<p>Riku had his first tub here; both Akane and Bryn have been showering and Riku showers with his dad, but I know how much he enjoys playing in the tub. It's relaxing too, and the steam in the room is good for his chest. I had cleaned the tub earlier and Akane had partially filled it, so after dinner in he went. What a happy boy he was with five containers to pour from and into! He also likes being wrapped up in the towel like a baby, even when the towel isn't heated the way it is at Nana's in SF. I read him his story in bed and tucked him in at 7:30; he was sound asleep at 8 p.m. </p>
<p>However, not an hour later he was awake, crying and coughing. He would settle down very quickly, be in a deep sleep, snoring quietly, and then the cough would hit again. At one point, we were all quite alarmed as it seemed he wasn't able to breathe; what a scary thing that was! I just held him and it passed but he will be going back to the doctor in two days, when his medication is finished. <br />
As a result of Riku's coughing and upsets, the  rest of the evening was a short one... I wrote a couple of emails, and did a little knitting on Candy's scarf which I have been working at whenever I sit down with Riku for meals, or when I don't have computer access. There are times when Bryn needs both computers; it might be time to get a laptop of my own! </p>
<p>Bedtime early... 10:30 p.m. as Riku is calling out frequently, at one point saying "Play-Doh" in a loud voice!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/12/a_long_walk_and_more_gelato.html">A Long Walk.. .and More Gelato!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku and I slept late today, waking at 7:30, after a somewhat restless night for him. The coughing stopped soon after I crawled in with him,, but he had bad dreams, calling out not to wake him up, and just being a bit fretful. However, he woke a happy boy and ate a good breakfast immediately. </p>
<p>I showered quickly, had Akane show me how to use the washer; you put the clothes in, and the machine weighs it and decides how much water is required. It was a lovely sunny day and I hung my clothes up on the line outside on the balcony. I tidied up and came out to find that Akane had prepared breakfast for me, "bacon", scrambled eggs, and toast. Bryn had made me tea so it was a lovely breakfast. Usually, I have a piece of toast with peanut butter or a banana. </p>
<p>I decided to get out for some fresh air so Riku and I went off at 10:45 with Riku in the stroller. Usually he likes to walk until he's tired but today he asked to go right in; we took along his mittens as it seems quite cool out despite the sun. </p>
<p>I just wandered about the streets, going down interesting looking laneways, and enjoying the sun when it was out. Riku asked for his mittens and enjoyed the little "thumbs in the thumb hole, fingers altogether" song when I put them on him. They are attached to strings to keep them together, just like the ones my mom used to make for us. </p>
<p>Riku fell asleep about twenty minutes into our walk, which was great, as he was a little cranky at home. I enjoyed meandering about and found a little shop where the husband and wife were making and frying up tofu. I stopped to buy a package of three for 130 yen, and then asked if I could take their photo. They both smiled and the man gave me the "traditional" peace sign as I clicked the button. </p>
<p>I found a "shopping" street with banners at each end and wandered slowly along, looking at all the items for sale. Wandered into a big grocery store just checking out the prices, but the noise level was too high and I was afraid Riku would waken. </p>
<p>He napped for forty-five minutes and woke just past a large playground/park area we had passed on the last trip in May, but had never stopped in to explore. Initially, it looked quite boring with one slide and a few painted plaster animals to sit on, but Riku enjoyed the slide very much. It had large metal ribs, starting out low and ending with them much higher up, so by the time he reached the top he was standing at the end of the slide. He was the only child there and must have gone up and down about fifteen times. Then he discovered a ladder about halfway up on the side and used that way for a bit. From there we went on to a wonderful collection of dried leaves, laying by a fence. We walked through them, kicked them about and at each other, he tossed some over the fence and then made a huge pile of them. What a grand time he had! Of course, he also collected two perfect sticks which were part and parcel of the various activities. </p>
<p>Home for lunch, fried rice for Riku as well as a dish of kobocha squash, made by his mom. He ate some of both and then we coloured together for the first time. Riku has a colouring book and wanted me to do colour with him. Of course he always impressed me with his ability to not only stay inside the lines but to choose such great colours. The second page he started he would do one section in two colours and go on to the next section, choosing another colour combination. He looks quite intent on it while he's working and yet obviously enjoys it. </p>
<p>The afternoon went by in typical fashion, with Riku playing on his own for a bit, then we read a couple of stories, and he made tea and cake for me in his kitchen. </p>
<p>At 3 p.m. Bryn wondered if we would like to walk out for a gelato and of course Riku and I were both interested. It is the perfect little mid-afternoon walk, just fifteen minutes away with a reward at the end of it. Once again, the owner came out to tempt us with flavours he thinks we will enjoy. This time Bryn chose banana milk, which tasted just like fresh bananas... no artificial flavours at all, I had the wonderful coconut which he had made just a small container of, and Riku had of course his favourite strawberry, but gave away his frozen strawberry slices to his dad and to me. </p>
<p>It was just the three of us for dinner, so Bryn had leftovers, I made Riku oatmeal and toast for his dinner, and I didn't eat as I was full of gelato! </p>
<p>I warmed up the tub water for Riku and his dad sat with him while I did some emailing. He had lots of fun, and I bundled him up, put lots of cream on that warm little body, and had him tucked in at 7:05; at 7:30 I was typing away on the computer. However, Riku had a tough time settling down with his coughing spells; they were worse today than they have been, so it's off to the doctor for him tomorrow. He woke many times and I kept going in, settling him down in just a couple of minutes just to have it go on in another half hour or so. </p>
<p>Akane came home about 8 p.m. after a relaxing day out on her own. She kindly let me use her computer for the rest of the evening, as I was so far behind in both emails and my blog from last night. I managed to get that done and a few longer emails written before heading off to bed at 11:20. Riku had been sleeping soundly for the last two hours so I got more done than I expected to. Off I go...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/12/a_visit_with_tomoha_and_her_pa.html">A Visit with Tomoha and Her Parents</a></h2>
								<p>Riku coughed only a couple of times in the night and slept right through until 7:40 this morning, eleven hours sleep for him! This is just what he needs and I hope to keep him on this track while I am here. We had our usual morning routine, with a little drawing time for Riku first thing, while eating some banana and a few bites of his cereal. I went off to shower immediately as we are to be at the clinic with Riku when it opens at 9:30; there are no appointments made here so it's first come, first served.</p>
<p>Akayo has the day off today and has offered to drive us all to the Italian restaurant we went to in May, for lunch. Riku needs to have a wee nap under his belt so that he lasts throughout the meal.</p>
<p>Akane, Riku, and I left the condo at 9:15, but there were still about six people in front of us inside the clinic. Riku was happy to sit and play with the toys and a new set of plastic building blocks, and since it wasn't nearly as busy today, we waited for only a half hour or so.</p>
<p>The verdict today: Riku's throat is almost completely free of infection with just small pockets on each side to heal. However, he has a mild case of bronchitis, and more antibiotics to take, as well as a patch to wear for 24 hours a day on his back (or chest), to help with the coughing. None of us has any idea what this patch is or how it works but later on Kei told us that Tomoha had worn one not long ago and it had worked.</p>
<p>Akane went home after the visit, and I continued on with Riku. We spent a little time in the park before our walk. There were quite a few children there today, and four dogs being exercised. Riku was quite fascinated, let a large dog lick his hand, and patted it, but was taken aback when the dog barked a loud bark at him! Riku took many trips down the slide today, standing nicely in line behind some younger children while they slowly climbed up the ladder.</p>
<p>Finally, off we went for our walk. It was quite cold out but eventually, over the next hour, the sun came out. Riku fell into a nice sleep about a half hour into the walk and then was awakened by something after just twenty minutes. It was obvious by the time he was home and we were preparing to leave at 1 p.m. that Riku wasn't going to have any fun at all eating out, and neither would we. He was talking back(!) to his dad, quite new behaviour for our little man, and had to be put in his room for a couple of minutes which made him even angrier. Bryn decided that Riku shouldn't go out after all for lunch, and I agreed, and offered to stay home with him.</p>
<p>Riku was furious, banging his little riding car around and thrashing about in anger, but within a half hour he was in a deep sleep and slept for an hour and a bit before calling out. I tried to settle him and leave but he was super-aware of my trying to sneak out, and I finally decided it was more important that he sleep than I have some computer time.</p>
<p>We had made arrangements this afternoon for Kei, her husband, and Tomoha to come over later, after his nap. I'm sure he would have slept longer but when he rolled over at 4 p.m. I didn't encourage him to go back to sleep.</p>
<p>At 4:30 our visitors arrived, but Riku was not in a wonderful mood for this first visit at home. He is sick, and probably would have napped for another half hour so wasn't up to Tomoha playing with his toys. She just moved on to the next item of interest and eventually Riku just let it go and played independently with something else too. Tomoha's dad (I have forgotten his name) asked Bryn to check his translation paper for a class he is taking, written from Japanese to English. Bryn said it was pretty good and made just a couple of corrections. Tei and Akane chatted a bit, and I asked some questions, which Akane translated when I couldn't make myself understood.</p>
<p>We sat on the floor in the living/dining room while the children played, and after an hour or so had a little birthday celebration for Tomoha, who turns three on the 16th. I gave Tomoha a Raffi CD, since her parents would very much like her to speak English (they sing to her from song sheets), and a tiny birthday book featuring a mouse, which Riku also has. They gave Riku two Matchbox-type vehicles, which he painstakingly worked on getting out of the blister packs and succeeded with just a little bit of help from his parents. He was determined to do it all himself but it would have been hard for me to do so.</p>
<p>We decided to do this early so that Akane and Bryn could meet them all; once Akane goes into labour there will be no opportunity for a visit like this.</p>
<p>By the end of the visit Riku was being the perfect little host, offering around a tray of apple slices and making sure that Tomoha got the slices without the skin. He tried to stop her dad at one point from taking one of them. He played at the table at one point with his Play-Doh, which left Tomoha free to play with whatever she wanted to... his kitchen set, his firehouse, and his singing book, as well as his riding car. We took a few group photos and a few of the children, and said goodbye around 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Quick dinner for Riku... kabocha squash, followed by oatmeal, followed by a really rich chocolate pudding with some powder from the doctor sprinkled on it... not sure what it is. He took his liquid antibiotic, and had his daddy put his PJs on, as well as the patch, or "sticker" as he put it. Teeth brushed, a little TV on daddy's lap, and tucked in by mommy(!) at 9:15 after Akane read him three Japanese storybooks. I cleaned up the toys and the kitchen. Oh, Riku spent some time running around with a bare bottom, a rare event, as he doesn't like to do this, a top on, and at one point the tea cozy, which made him look like a sultan!</p>
<p>Riku is changing quickly these days... he is getting into things he has never been curious about... the kitchen drawers, the refrigerator drawers, rolling the chair over to see what is on the kitchen counters, asking if he can have a cough drop, thinking it's a candy, and just generally being more assertive about what he wants to do and when he wants to do it. I think he is having his two-year year in his third! Oh yes, this may well be a very challenging year, especially with the baby on her way soon.</p>
<p>He's also saying things he has never said, showing his feelings about things he isn't happy about by saying he will crash them, or break them, complete with arm movements letting us know how he will do this. Today he told me the baby wouldn't come out(!) and he would crash the school, something he said a few days ago too. Ah yes, the child is changing and will need some gentle handling in the next year or so. He is letting his opinions be known in no uncertain terms!</p>
<p>He and his mom are both now sleeping soundly in <b>my</b> bed! ... well, Riku's and my bed. I'm off to get my PJs on, do a little emailing, and get to bed in an hour or so...</p>
<p>Funny comment from Riku tonight; we were talking about how big Akane's tummy is and Bryn asked Riku what was in there... his reply, "A <b>big</b> chocolate!"</p>
<p>Night night...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/12/introducing_the_new_theatrical.html">Introducing the New "Theatrical Three" Boy</a></h2>
								<p>I mentioned yesterday, I believe, about how Riku has been changing dramatically before our eyes these past few days. It is really astounding to watch all this happen. Riku has opinions about everything from what he is going to eat and not eat, to whom he wants to dress him, and which lucky person puts him to bed. But it's not only that; he is having long conversations about things in the past, such as movies he has watched, and for which he has am amazing memory for detail. He has decided that he doesn't always need to look at the camera, just because it's there, and that he can at least say "No Daddy, no Nana" when asked who is going to put his PJs on. The fact that those are the only two choices makes no difference at all. </p>
<p>Tonight he and Bryn had a longer than five minute discussion about the movie they saw together some time ago, "Spirited Away". Riku started off by saying "Remember when we saw the show about 'Spirited Away'"?", and then went on to talk about various things that happened, and try so hard to ask about one segment that didn't ring a bell with either of his parents. It was astounding to listen to this; we keep saying it's like having a brand new person in our midst! </p>
<p>We both woke at 7 this morning, although I think Riku may well have been awake before me, just patiently waited for me to show some signs of being awake... and then saying "good morning" with a big smile to ensure that I wouldn't dream of drifting back to sleep. He is so quiet that it amazes me. Today we pretended there was a ghost coming into the room and we both ducked under the duvet and kept quiet. When it was safe we got out from our hiding place, but with our monster spray handy. </p>
<p>Usual morning routine around here; at one point Riku was starting to fade and be a little grouchy, so I planned to tuck him into bed. He had a big mid-morning snack of egg and tomatoes, after telling me he was hungry when bedtime was suggested. </p>
<p>This is an old ploy of Amelia's and I wonder if she got the word out to him that this worked. He did seem to perk up, however, and a little playtime with his dad seemed to revive him. </p>
<p>I had lots of email time this morning, and made good use of it by answering a huge number of emails that had been stacking up over the past week. Akane was sweeping and vacuuming and then lay down to read; Riku happily entertained himself for most of the morning, although we did take time for some colouring and pretend meal time too. He likes a little interaction now and then and it's always fun to hear what is going on in his mind. </p>
<p>We had our first Skype with Susan and Amelia today, or at least Riku and I did. We could hear Bryn talking to someone and Riku leaned over and said to me "Who Daddy talking to?". I said I didn't know and so he leaned over a little further and said "What he talking about?" After listening for about thirty seconds he went back to making me lunch, after saying "I not know what he talking about." When I told him I thought it might be Auntie Susan, he immediately got down from the chair and went into the bedroom to say hello. It was so sweet to hear Amelia's voice. Every once in a while she would come in and say "hi" and Riku would do the same. I sang her our new song about the currant buns, and learned that they are going off to buy their Christmas tree. What fun they will have, and Susan will take lots of photos, I'm sure. Kevin's mom is visiting from Alaska, which makes it even more special an event. </p>
<p>Riku was a great little chef and waiter today. He went in and fed his mom while she was lying in bed, using all of his pretend food and dishes. Then it was my turn; he knows I don't eat fish so when he offered it, he immediately said "oh no, you not eat fish!" and put it aside, offering me pizza, a big mushroom, a tomato, and corn on the cob. I asked for butter and he gave me a pretend dab of it, and when I asked for pepper went over and came back with the correct shaker out of a choice of curry, paprika, and salt. We spent a little time yesterday spelling out pepper and repeating it over the course of yesterday's pretend meals. Riku gets more pleasure out of his little kitchen than I would have imagined. I would love to have one in San Francisco for all the children. And I like being catered to, by such a handsome little chef! </p>
<p>Bryn came out from his "office", the master bedroom, to tell me we were going out for lunch, to a nearby tofu restaurant. This sounded like a great plan, and at 12:30 we set out for this small spot just five minutes away. While Akane and Bryn were at the bank, Riku and I walked up to say "hello" to the woman at the clothing store. She came out beaming away at him, held him and gave him a big hug. I took a photo of them, and she showed him off to two new women in her shop, asking him how old he was, what his name was, and clapping when he finished singing the ABC song to them. He is so obviously feeling much better today, thank goodness. </p>
<p>Wouldn't you know it? The tofu restaurant is no longer serving lunch. I am destined not to eat in a specialty tofu shop in Japan, it seems! They also make cheesecake, and Riku had a small sample; he liked it very much and Bryn bought a half dozen quite small servings for home. </p>
<p>Akane suggested another small neighbourhood place, one that I had been to in May and liked very much. Bryn had not been there before, and I was more than happy to eat there again. I had the most delicious hot pot with vegetables in a mushroom broth, with tofu instead of shrimp, thanks to Akane speaking with the waiter. Riku ate lots of Akane's noodles, and some of the hot pot, and kept himself busy with Bryn's and my credit cards. I had neglected to take along the books I usually take out with us. We had a second dish of noodles with vegetables and tofu as well, so I had my tofu fix anyway. </p>
<p>Riku was doing a bit of flirting with a family sitting nearby. The father was paying lots of attention to Riku, and when we left the teenage daughter picked Riku up and gave him a hug. He has his little fan club for sure in Japan! </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn stopped for a coffee together, while Riku and I walked through the park, and then came up for another little cheesecake (he had one for dessert in the restaurant too), and tuck in time. It was 2:20 when he fell asleep (I had to hold him for about one full minute before he gave in in my arms, after fooling around rolling over, and playing with the curtains, etc. etc. before I took a different tack.) and he woke at 5:30! He woke a few times but was back asleep within one minute each time, and finally at 5:30 I turned off the noise machine and left the door open. Not one cough the whole time! </p>
<p>Oh, when we came in from lunch, Riku as always opened the door with the key. I said to him "One day, Riku, your sister Mirei will open the door with the key" to which Riku replied, "Nana will say 'Oh no, Mirei, you are too little'."</p>
<p>I think he would have slept longer, as I had to hold him wrapped in his blanket for the longest time, forty-five minutes or so while he watched his TV show. Finally, he came around, telling us he wanted to have egg, "bacon", and toast. Akane made up a plate for him with a little tomato too, and it all disappeared... as did some veggie/fruit juice, fresh crackers his parents bought when they were out, then apple juice, and some oatmeal, some "O"s, and the thick pudding with his medicine sprinkled on it. We wondered where it was all going, but knew when we picked him up. It felt like he had gained five pounds tonight! </p>
<p>Akane made me up a big bowl of a dish made of the tofu I bought the other day with some nice big carrot slices and a tasty sauce. Yum! I was pretty full from lunch and the bananas we are trying to use up, but I know what I'll be having for lunch tomorrow. </p>
<p>He and Bryn had lots of play time: "Dad, let's play! What should we do? Build something? Okay. Oh, that looks like a castle!", and when they built a structure with the wooden tools he declared that it was wobbly. I wish I had a tape recorder with me for all of this chatter. He has so much to say and has such fun just playing and chatting. </p>
<p>They watched about an hour of "The Incredibles" with Riku sitting on Bryn's lap and discussing it all. I was the bad guy and insisted it was bedtime at 9 p.m. He was drooping for sure, and despite his long nap looked like he needed his bed. There was a bit of a struggle with PJs but his dad took over, and by the time it was teeth brushing and face washing time he was fine. He did, however, protest about the patch on his back for the coughing, saying "NO STICKER!" The sticker, needless to say, is in place. </p>
<p>I read him a story and his mom tucked him in... too late but tomorrow is another day and may involve a morning nap. It's the weekend for us, starting at 2 p.m. when Bryn is officially off work, until Tuesday here. This weekend the crib goes up; perhaps this is what Mirei is waiting for, or at least that is what Akane and I suggested to Bryn.</p>
<p>p.s. This morning Bryn and I were commenting on how Riku is changing so quickly right now and I said there had to be a term for three year olds as there is for the terrific twos as I always referred to them... Bryn came up with "theatrical threes" which says it perfectly. He checked it on the Web and it was mentioned in only about fifteen places so I am very pleased to claim it for us too!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/12/short_but_still_not_short_enou.html">Short... But Still not Short Enough!</a></h2>
								<p>That's my new motto for blogging. After months of knowing my blogs were far too detailed I have decided make them short and sweet. So, yesterday in a nutshell... </p>
<p>Happy, busy morning for Riku playing on his own for the longest time, "fixing" his car by piling lots of toys on top of it. He also worked with his dad taking apart a great airplane they built last night. And there was time for drawing and eating and snacking too. </p>
<p>We met Tomoha, and her parents, Kei and Shigeru, in the park at 10 a.m. Cold and crisp, but clear, and the bonus was meeting up with a nice woman we met in May last year. She was there almost every day walking her small Dachshund, which Riku loved to pat. She speaks English quite well, so we chatted a bit, and I took her photo with Riku. She also told me the man with the four dogs who took Riku's and my photos last spring was away hiking in the mountains, so we quite likely won't be seeing him. </p>
<p>From there, we walked to Riku's school to play in the playground; Riku's teacher was there and he was a bit apprehensive about being there, but eventually believed that we were there just to play. Our visit ended with an hour in a playroom on the third floor, with a "ballroom" area, and two slides.</p>
<p>After lunch Riku had a three hour nap, ending at 5:40, when I opened the door, turned off the sound machine, while he finished it up with some snuggling with his mom. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane planned for us to have dinner at a local okonomiyaki place, within five minutes of the condo. We walked over and found the restaurant completely empty, even of the owner, but he soon showed up, turned on the grill and started cooking our dinners... a base of cabbage, flour, egg, tempura crumbs, and sticky yam, with added green onions, pickled ginger, and varying other ingredients such as pork, shrimp, squid, oysters, etc. Each restaurant has its own style and/or variants and can taste quite different... but similar. Riku was not content to sit there while they cooked, and I decided it would be best to take him home for his dinner and have mine brought home to me later on. </p>
<p>We stopped in at the "Little Mermaid" bakery downstairs and picked up a few baked treats for us... a golf ball sized cream-filled pastry, a bun for Riku, and one for me topped with pumpkin seeds. </p>
<p>Riku was eating the noodles and veggies soup I prepared for him, when Akane and Bryn came home, and after eating a half portion of my okonomiyaki, I (with help from Bryn) got Riku into his PJs and he was tucked in at 8:30. Wakened a number of times, just not going into a deep sleep, so I went in to him at 9:30, "Put your head down Nana"... and woke up, fully clothed, teeth unbrushed, face unwashed, and thirsty at 1:30 a.m.! Very atypical for me to fall asleep when lying with him... and getting ready properly for bed after sleeping for five hours was not ideal. </p>
<p>P.S.s: </p>
<p>... Big hug and a photo with the woman in the mall store downstairs, for Riku of course! </p>
<p>... and last night, while tucking Riku in, he playfully went through our now "traditional" morning routine... pulling aside the curtain to the pitch black night, saying "It's light outside! Good morning! Time to get up!" </p>
<p>Riku's weight... 13 kilos... 28 1/2 pounds</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/12/a_bed_for_mirei_ultraman_and.html">A Bed for Mirei, Ultraman and... .</a></h2>
								<p>At 6:45 a.m. Riku woke me up saying there was a monster in our room! We quickly hid under the duvet, peeking out after a minute to see if we were safe. Riku wasn't sure so we took his golden dog in with us, just in case. Whew! Safe for another day. </p>
<p>We sat on the floor and played with his tool kit for quite a while. I managed to build a bridge that Riku's lowest fire engines could fit under and then we satisfied his "I'm hungry!" plea for food. </p>
<p>Today is the day that Mirei's crib was to be installed in the bedroom, so while I Skyped with Garry, Bryn and Riku got busy with the tools and put the crib together. Riku took his job seriously and helped carry parts and hold the rails for his dad. </p>
<p>Garry and I got caught up on lots of news and later on he sent on some wonderful photos of friends, both human and feline. He is off to Sri Lanka on Monday for the Christmas season, leaving the cold weather and snow behind in Montreal. </p>
<p>Bryn had agreed to go to the "ballroom" downstairs to see Riku roll about and bury himself in the balls, so we left here at 10:15. Riku put his own mittens on today; we were as delighted as he was, as he has only worn them twice now and had to fiddle a bit to get those thumbs in the thumb hole! </p>
<p>He had a great time again with the balls and slide, although it doesn't take too much exertion to bring on the coughing and tire him out. The big draw downstairs today though was the arrival of the action hero "Ultraman" dressed up as Santa(!), so after a half hour we headed downstairs to the main level. </p>
<p>While we were waiting for his arrival we stopped to see hello to the woman in the dress shop. Once again Riku got picked up for a big hug, and this visit also was given a lovely ornament, a finely woven filagree ball, quite small, with a ball made from old kimono cloth inside. She also gave him what we call, in North America, a dried Chinese lantern. After a quick trip to the bakery we joined the now crowded area in the mall to see "Ultraman". Riku was just thrilled and grinned from ear to ear while perched on Bryn's shoulders. </p>
<p>The woman standing next to me, and a woman beside her, were two of the women from the playground area on the second floor outside, where Riku and I spent so much time last May. It was such fun to see them again, and their children recognized me from their front row vantage point and smiled and waved until the hero caught their attention. </p>
<p>A nap for Riku followed right after his lunch; I read to him (the Caillou books are his favourites right now), and then Akane tucked in beside him for a one and a half hour sleep. We had planned to go to the gelato place today, but forgot about it until it was too late. Riku watched "The Incredibles" movie sitting on his dad's lap for the first half; he was slow to waken from his nap, but some more food and this snuggle helped him come 'round. </p>
<p>Bryn had bought Riku two sheets of plastic stencils at the "ballroom" shop, and Riku spent a good long while carefully tracing along the lines of the animals on one sheet and the dinosaurs on the other. While he was doing this, and when nothing out of the ordinary at all was going on, he piped up with "calm down, just calm down" which made us all laugh. Of course that just encouraged him and he managed to entertain us for a good long while by coming out with it now and then. He sounded exactly like his daddy, so there was no question where that came from!  </p>
<p>Dinner out with the Goda family was planned for this evening, so at 5:40 we left the apartment to walk to where Ayako works. She showed me her office and then Riku kept her busy trying to get him into the parking lot, and we were at the tofu restaurant at 6:30 to meet Akane's parents. They were about twenty minutes late, so Riku had lots of time to play with Ayako. It was a lovely spot and we had a big room to ourselves. The food was delicious and I took lots of photos of it and the company. It was something to see Riku eating salmon roe, deciding not to eat the tail of the ebi (shrimp), and asking before the meal if he could have sushi! I had agadashi tofu, yuba (boiled soy milk which forms a skin, and is scooped up and eaten after dipping in a sauce... delicious!, and a big green salad with crisp tofu "chips" which I crumbled into the salad. Tea, rice, and some soy pudding of Riku's which he not only shared with me, but fed to me every other bite! </p>
<p>Home at 8:45 and I tucked Riku in at 9:15 after he had a chance to look at a large calendar his Baa-ba had given him. I walked out at 9:30... email and blog time.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/12/christmas_time_is_coming_and_m.html">Christmas Time is Coming... and Maybe Mirei Too!</a></h2>
								<p>Tonight, before bedtime, Riku was taking tiny ornaments from little drawers under a wooden Advent Christmas tree his Baa-ba and Jiiji gave to him the year he was born. How he enjoyed it this year, with such pleasure in unwapping each one, and exclaiming over it before hanging in on the tree... all the while singing "Christmas time is coming". </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the tatami room next door his parents were sitting on the futon. In between sessions of rubbing Akane's back, they were taking note of Mirei's active movements; Akane had a couple of minor contractions today and we were hoping Mirei might be born on Uncle Frank's birthday. When Riku was finished with his tree activities, he decided to join Akane and Bryn on the futon, bringing along his tool kit and some cars. At one point Bryn told him he could feel the baby moving, and with his hand on her tummy he felt her! The interest didn't last too long though, and back he went to his toys. </p>
<p>Working backwards from here... Akane went off for her 9:30 Monday appointment with her doctor, calling at 10 a.m. to say she was being taken upstairs to the birth clinic for a more thorough examination. She was 3 cm. dilated and when we arrived an hour later, Akane was ready to leave with us. </p>
<p>Riku had been looking forward to playing with the toys in the toy room here, so he was a little upset that we were leaving so soon. However, we left to catch a train, and then a bus, to Sakai City. It was a bitterly cold day and while we waited in line for the bus, Bryn went off to buy a coffee, and some hot chocolate for me. It had a nice layer of whipped cream on it, and once seated on the bus, I offered Riku a taste of it. He just loved it and saved one last swallow for me! </p>
<p>He sang "The wheels on the bus..." on the bus, making up his own verses, something he has been doing a lot of lately. He sang "Daddy on the bus says "it's okay" and "Riku on the bus says (insert coughing sound)". Riku is quite likely to burst out into song at any time of the day; he has a good memory for what he hears and now happily improvises too.  </p>
<p>We were out for a walk-in visit to a dermatogist for Riku. He has dry patches on his ankle and one wrist, which don't seem to be healing properly, so after a 55 minute wait we saw a doctor. He prescribed cortisone, which Riku uses already, and something liquid to be taken for two weeks after each meal. </p>
<p>While waiting, Riku had a great time with his dad, looking at the books in the waiting room. At one point I asked him to throw away some garbage (he and Bryn had gotten rid of some earlier) so off he went, with me not realizing the garbage can was through two sliding doors and outside! Egad! He obviously went out, threw it away, and came right back in.</p>
<p>Akane stayed downtown to do a little Christmas shopping for Riku, while Bryn and I walked him home in his stroller, hoping he would nap. He did, although for only 45 minutes. I bought egg salad sandwiches on "Shopping Road", just a few minutes from the condo, but we had hoped Riku would continue sleeping while we ate. </p>
<p>Once upstairs, Bryn got right to work, and I made "mac 'n cheese" for Riku at his request. I added mushrooms, tomatoes, carrots, and spinach to it, and he ate a big bowl while playing at the table with me. Akane came in not too much later, feeling a little blue, so she and Bryn snuggled up and had a long winter's nap together. Riku and I had a great afternoon together, playing with his garage, doing a little stenciling, and chatting and singing away. It's the best kind of day, just hanging out, and I think Riku feels the same way. At one point during the morning/afternoon out, he said "Let's go home now" and I'm glad we did so. </p>
<p>He's back to school tomorrow, but we wanted to make sure his chest was clear, so back to the local doctor we went. Bryn and I headed off with him at 5:30, after Akane had called to explain why we were coming in. Bryn's Japanese isn't up to translating whatever the doctor might tell us, but he did ask about going to school and that was fine. His chest is clear but with the occasional coughing and stuffiness, she gave him more liquid medicine to be taken after his three main meals a day. We were there for an hour and a half though, and so it was much later than I had hoped for when we got home. My plan was to have Riku asleep at 7:30; he needs to be well rested to be at school all day tomorrow and had such a short nap today. </p>
<p>He was a happy boy though, and ate a huge amount of food; he seems to be going through a growth spurt and so as well as the porridge with grated apple, and two slices of his "bacon", he asked for egg and toast and ate it all. Off he went to his Advent calendar, and from there it was a typical off to bed routine... minus the tub, which shall be replaced with a shower tomorrow. He said goodnight to his Mommy and Daddy, still sitting on the futon, contemplating Mirei's imminent (we hope!) arrival. I tucked Riku in at 8:15 and walked out the door at 8:30. </p>
<p>Quiet evening with not much computer time; Riku woke briefly a couple of times, I did some knitting (Candy's scarf), and went off to bed at 10:30 on the chance that there may be a wake-up call for Mirei during the night...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/12/no_baby_yet.html">No Baby Yet...</a></h2>
								<p>Well, despite our positive thoughts yesterday about Mirei arriving on Uncle Frank's birthday, she decided to remain where she is. Bryn says Akane has just made her little abode too comfortable and she has decided not to relocate quite yet. We just took some photos of Akane, so perhaps that will get things moving; she certainly looks more than ready for this baby to get a move on. </p>
<p>Today was a school day for Riku. He had a great couple of hours at home before leaving, partly due to his almost eleven hours of sleep last night. He was rested and happy and ate a big breakfast, and went off with his daddy to school at 9:05. Bryn said he was fine until they were in sight of the school before he started protesting his fate, but Bryn knew he would be fine once he got in there. Sure enough, when we arrived to pick him up at 5 p.m. he was in no rush to leave, which was also true of the last two times he was there. He did cry for a bit both then and at naptime, and was coughing a bit too, but we hope both these things will get better over the next while. Riku's next day there will be Friday, three days from now. </p>
<p>Akane puttered about again today, sweeping the floors and tidying up Riku's kitchen and play area. I read and knit but didn't have much computer time until later in the afternoon, and then wrote long emails to both Uncle Frank and Zoe. Nice to have the time to write them before too long has passed by; otherwise I forget what I have already written. </p>
<p>Bryn and I decided to go off to do a bit of shopping in a big plaza not too far away. It is at a main train station called Tennoji which I have not been to before, except as a transfer point on the trains. Bryn has a bit of a cold and is under the weather, but we poked around trying to find a 100 yen store Akane had been to the other day. We found it with a phone call to Akane, who had decided to stay close to home today. We also wandered about for a while checking out a few other stores and found some silverware for the children, some great cards, and a couple of plastic travel items for me. Caught the express train at 4:30 to get back for Riku's pickup at school. </p>
<p>It was very cold and windy all day; the sun was shining but it was still bone-chillingly cold out in the open. We came right home with Riku, who was happy to be surrounded by his toys. After a snack of rice crackers and some tiny delicious tomatoes, he got busy taking all of the tiny decorations off the advent tree and putting them all back on again. </p>
<p>Akane and I earlier in the day had cleared some pottery and dried flower arrangements off a table in the tatami room, and have made it into our holiday area. It now has the decorated small evergreen on the table, along with the Advent tree and the tiny house that Tomoha gave to Riku for Christmas on Saturday. A little wicker stand holds the snowman Mrs. Goda sent along with the tree, the first Christmas card to arrive, from Uncle Frank. It now feels a little more like Christmas and I wish Kelly were here to remind me of the words to some of the songs I would like to teach Riku, such as "Must Be Santa" and even more obvious ones I should know. </p>
<p>For instance, what is the last line of the first verse for "Christmas time is coming" repeated three times? Any help would be greatly appreciated as Riku is singing everything he hears and I had better get it right before it's in his head. While he was playing tonight after dinner he was really working hard to remember all the lines in "Santa Claus is coming to town". I know this one, thank goodness. </p>
<p>I did a little emailing while Riku played happily with his toys, with his mom lying nearby on the futon. Bryn started dinner, as we had decided we were going to have the "Lynne and Gail" special... boiled potatoes, cut into chunks in a bowl, topped with a hard boiled egg, freshly boiled and hot, and a nice knob of butter and pepper. Just lately I have started adding something green to it, for a healthier meal, which tonight was steamed broccoli. Bryn also peeled some crab legs Mrs. Goda had sent over. All I did was cook the broccoli, after Bryn had prepared it. </p>
<p>I set the table for four, we turned off the light over the table, and we all sat down together to eat at the same time. Usually this does not happen here, as we all eat different things at different times, or at least Riku and I do. Akane and Bryn often eat later in the evening, as they piece at bits during the afternoons. So, this was a real treat and we all enjoyed it. </p>
<p>Riku ate so very well, including a few bites of crab, drank a big cup of plain soy milk (he always has a glass of chocolate soy at breakfast), and while eating his dessert sang Japanese nursery songs with his Mommy, complete with actions. I wish I had had my movie camera here with me as it was so very cute. Bryn joined in on one of them too. Riku is so animated when he sings that he is a joy to watch.<br />
We all commented on how rounded he is getting, looking more grown-up as a result of it. </p>
<p>Playtime followed dinner, and while I tidied up, he joined his parents on the futon. Bryn built him a plane from Riku's tool kit, and by the time he had finished it, Riku had moved all of his toys, including the kitchen sink!, to the edge of the tatami room. He wanted "all my toys, many things" right there and they have been left there untouched for tomorrow morning. Tucked Riku in at 8:15 and left the room at 8:25. </p>
<p>While I was doing this, Akane and Bryn faced the nasty cold weather to venture out for a forty minute round trip walk out for gelato. It has been six days since we've had any and Bryn felt we really needed to get back to it. I agreed. Apparently it was so windy and cold that Akane begged to go back, but once they turned the corner it was much better, they shared a delicious chestnut gelato there (this will be my next cup), and brought home two containers for me to choose from, a raspberry cream and a chocolate. I was in a chocolate mood but the other was certainly appealing looking. Mine was just delicious, so creamy, rich, and chocolately, and Bryn insisted on saving me some calories and having a few bites of it too. </p>
<p>Bryn off to bed at 10 p.m. Riku awoke a few minutes ago crying out loudly and refusing to be comforted. He finally settled down and I told him his mommy would come in and snuggle him. I think he needs this extra time with her right now, as we hope that soon she will be off to the clinic having this baby. I'm sure Riku is going to suffer somewhat with that sitution as they have never been apart for more than two days and just one night. </p>
<p>I'll be off to bed shortly just in case Mirei decides tonight is the night. Bryn told me last night that if it does happen at night, I will be going to the clinic with Akane at her request. I am relieved that I will not miss the birth of this child... and now just hope she arrives very soon.  </p>
<p>I shall close off with a message on a wedding card I saw in one of the stores today: "Congratulations on your marriage. I celebrate that the great partner who catches all you was able to be encountered from the bottom of my heart. With my love and very wishes for today and for the future."</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/12/a_cold_day_and_a_dunk_in_a_poo.html">A Cold Day and a Dunk in a Pool</a></h2>
								<p>It's 9 p.m and Riku is tucked soundly into bed. He fell asleep quite quickly after his tub time and tuck-in at 7:45, but managed to wrap his arms tightly around my neck making it very difficult to extricate myself from his grip, even after he fell asleep. </p>
<p>Our day started at 7:15 this morning, with a little boy prying my eyelids open; usually he just puts his face about three inches from mine, until I feel it there subconciously, but I suppose after my late to bed at midnight this wasn't working for him. His Daddy prepared him a bowl of mandarin orange segments, and I made him a piece of toast to get him through his "first breakfast" of the day. He had a dentist appointment at 9:30, so had a scrambled egg and a side dish of tomatoes before leaving for the five minute trip downstairs to the dentist. </p>
<p>What a successful visit this was, despite Riku's disappointment that there were no toys in the front office. However, he settled for a few stories instead until we were called in. Riku sat on his own in the chair, and expected to have the bib around his neck. I think he was surprised when the gal tipped his chair back, but he was relaxed and nothing fazed him at all. She had him rinse and spit and then chose orange as his choice of flavour for the floride treatment, and then just spitting when that was finished. The male dentist then came in and checked his teeth thoroughly, using the pick and mirror. I managed to get a few photos during this session and am so glad I took my camera along. </p>
<p>It was a very cold day here but the sun was shining so he and I headed off to the park across the street. There were no children there when we arrived, so Riku had the chance to mess up the neatly raked sand in the sandbox. He drew big circles in it with the edge of his shoe and seemed mighty pleased with the results. He went up and down the slides a few times, and then asked me to take a turn. I think we went up and down ten or more times, after Riku decided it was much more fun to take turns being first, with the other hanging on to the coat in front! </p>
<p>I got cold pretty quickly, so we headed in the direction of the condo, when I spotted a thin layer of ice on one of the two long very shallow pools of water in the rose garden area. We couldn't find a stick to poke through it and decided to go home and get one from the basket in the front hall. However, we lucked out and found one right at the crosswalk, so back we went. I showed Riku how he could poke it in the ice, and he went right to it. However, he was a bit too close to the slightly higher edge so I moved him back. He was still a bit close and just as I went to move him back again, he leaned forward and in he went! I'm sure he was startled, as the water was obviously very cold, but I had him out and in my arms in seconds. Brrr! I carried him right home, with his shoes and pants and jacket dripping water all the way. </p>
<p>I immediately got him out of his wet clothes, into nice warm dry ones, and made him a cup of hot chocolate. He thought it was quite an adventure, and brought up his "accident" a few times during the day. </p>
<p>Akane left at 12:30 to meet her mom, Bryn was busy working, and after Riku had his lunch, off he went for an early nap. He slept from 1-3:45 but still woke up a little out of sorts. Bryn picked him up, wrapped a light blanket around him and he snored against Bryn's chest for about fifteen minutes, finally coming 'round. Snacks, and lots of playtime followed. He had a grand time being "Dr. Dyment" (he now calls himself this whenever he gets his kit out), using the stethoscope, giving me a needle, checking my blood pressure, and taking my temperature. He also combed my hair for me and was very gentle doing so. </p>
<p>Akane came home with food for the adults; she had bought four little dishes of vegetarian goodies for me and I immediately had two of them... four pieces of tofu, and a dish of bright greens with slivers of tofu. I know that a lotus root dish awaits me tomorrow, as well as one other, as I managed to resist scarfing them all down tonight. </p>
<p>Riku ate noodles with veggies for dinner and quite enjoyed his tiny cone filled with raspberry cream gelato earlier in the afternoon. He ate lots of fruit today, which he loves... half a banana, two big strawberries, two mandarin oranges, and some apple slices. </p>
<p>We are trying to convince Riku to have his BMs in the toilet, but he just postpones having it until his diaper is back on. Today as usual, he went to our bedroom, shut the door, and told me he "Riku needs privacy"; if you try to go in he will hold up two fingers and say very seriously, "just two minutes". After this happened today, and he was changed, I told him this wasn't to happen anymore. His dad was there too, telling him he had to go to the toilet, and not in the bedroom. Then I started fooling around with him, telling him I was going to go to the bedroom and have a BM. He thought this was pretty funny, tried to come into the room, but I leaned against it, just as he does and told him "just two minutes". Of course he was telling me I had to go in the bathroom! And then Bryn went through the same routine after which Riku told him to come in the other room to have his diaper changed! It was hilarious; Bryn was down on the bed with his legs in the air, Riku was pretending to pull the diaper off, wipe him, and pat him. Why I didn't get the camera out I have no idea, except that is was just too funny to miss a minute of! </p>
<p>Tomorrow my plan is to get that diaper off him as soon as breakfast is over, as I know he won't want to lose control without a diaper on. He's ready for taking this next big step for sure, as he came home from school yesterday and immediately went to the bathroom. He also now tells me when "urine coming out!" so the awareness is there too. </p>
<p>Okay, this blog isn't short at all but they will be, they will! I just need days with no children in them... </p>
<p>... and no, Akane is not feeling any urges to push. I am now getting worried, as I am six days from leaving here. Baby Mirei, we want to see you very very soon!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/12/sunny_and_warmer_but_still_no.html">Sunny and Warmer... But Still no Mirei!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku awoke at 7:15 with giggles today, staying in bed again, pretending there was a monster coming in the door, and hiding our books and my watch under the covers with us. What a lovely way to start a day! </p>
<p>Bryn was up working hard when Riku wandered into the dining room. I prepared his first breakfast of "O"s, an orange, and chocolate soy milk, checked my email, and got into the shower first. </p>
<p>It was a sunny and bright day, and I wasn't sure how cold it was, but called Kei to see if she and Tomoha could meet us at the park at 10 a.m. Tomoha was still sleeping but she planned to waken her to make sure she would nap this afternoon. She called later to say they would meet us at 11 a.m. Riku polished off his now routine "second breakfast" of a poached egg on toast (he watched me cook it so knows that it is cooked in boiling water), two pieces of his "bacon", and plain soy milk.</p>
<p>What a fun morning this was, as there were so many familiar faces there... the two women with their dogs, a woman with a dog named Riku(!), our old friend the "dog man" (I got his name and address and as soon as Akane translates it for me I shall stop referring to him as the "dog man" (except in parentheses to remind you who it is!), and a mom we met in May, named Noriko, and her daughter Yui. This is the woman who gave me ointment for Riku's mosquito bites and later on wrote a wee note to me which Kei put in one of her letters for me. I didn't recognize them at first as Yui has grown much taller and her mom was wearing a sun hat the last time I saw her. </p>
<p>I had a chat with the dog man with some translation help from both Kei and Noriko and learned that he had indeed been mountain climbing for one month. I was so lucky to see him again, and he smiled so nicely at  Riku. This time I asked Kei to take a photo of me with him, for which I got thanked several times. Now I can mail him a photo; I took one of him alone... well, with his dogs, too. </p>
<p>The three children played very well together, collecting stones and sticks and wandering down some steps into a more desolate looking area. Some children from Riku's school were out playing, and he told me several times he was not going to school. At one point, after reassuring him once again that he was not going today, but would be going tomorrow he looked at me and said, very seriously, "tomorrow I am going to the doctor." Nice try, Riku! </p>
<p>Riku's vocabulary and language skills have changed so much, so rapidly, that I realized yesterday that talking with him now is just like talking with an adult. He makes perfect sense, can make himself understood 99.9% of the time, knows how to make jokes, and tease, and cajole, and express his anger (not always in an acceptable adult way, but he's getting there), and make it clear when he is hungry, when he has had enough, and how he wants his dessert despite being full of noodles. </p>
<p>Sitting on the futon yesterday, he said "Hmm, I wonder what Daddy is doing? Hmm, maybe nothing I guess. I can't hear him." Also last night he was watching a cooking segment on a children's TV show; they were cooking meat and he asked if I would like that dinner. I said "no", as I didn't eat meat. Riku replied: "I eat meat. I also eat crab. I eat lobster too... and then after a long pause, and a furrowed brow, he said "... but I don't like sea stars. They too crunchy" and then nodding and shaking his head with real certainty he repeated, "They too crunchy. Riku not like too crunchy." Akane laughed out loud when she heard this as of course he has never tasted a sea star and never will. He did eat octopus at dinner the other night, and salmon roe, so I suppose there was no reason for him to think one wouldn't eat a sea star too. </p>
<p>We came home to a delicious homemade lunch, fried rice with lots of veggies, prepared for us by Akane before going out with her sister.<br />
Riku had his with a few fresh tomatoes, and then I tucked him right into bed for his nap. He slept for only forty-five minutes, although it was partly my fault. I lay down beside him for a minute, and he immediately rolled over and put his face right next to mine, with wide eyes staring at me. I couldn't help but smile, and pulled my face down lower to hide it. He of course knew something was up and so pulled his face down to see mine; I was grinning even wider by now, so when he came down even lower I couldn't help but laugh. I started out snickering, and as he realized what was going on, he started laughing and trying to see me. Finally we both burst out laughing and that was the end of nap time! </p>
<p>Bryn was finished work, so he agreed to walk to Diamond City with us. We hoped Riku would nap, and he almost did, though not quite, but enjoyed the walk and the sights along the way. Bryn was stopping to take photos for his Japanese Web site, so it took us forty minutes to walk there. It was quite cool when we started out, but of course we were fine once we started moving. </p>
<p>Riku was happy to see the second floor toy space again as we had gone several times in May, but it was Bryn's first time there. Riku was obviously tired, and there weren't quite so many toys available, because of Christmas I suppose, so we didn't spend very long there. Perhaps we will get back again. Bryn found a free Atomu (Astroboy) stroller for Riku after he had a cup of hot chocolate from Starbucks; does he love his whipped cream! He's his Nana's boy.  </p>
<p>We left for home at 5 p.m. I was afraid he would fall asleep and he almost did, but a snack bag kept him going. We arrived home at 5:30; tomorrow is school for Riku so I want him in bed early after a relaxed evening. Porridge for dinner, toast and tomatoes, and two cups of plain soymilk which he seems to be enjoying a lot right now. He had a nice long splashy bath with a hair wash first, and then he and Bryn crashed cars for a bit before tuck-in at 7:30. I was out the door within ten minutes.</p>
<p>I spent the evening knitting, and going in and out to Riku after 10  p.m. (he was really snuffly), finally giving in and joining him at 11 p.m. </p>
<p>p.s. I did mean to say in yesterday's blog that the "pool" Riku fell into held about eight inches of water at its deepest. And while we were poking about in it today, pushing leaves back and forth, a very small child tripped into it!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/12/everyone_is_waiting_for_mirei.html">Everyone is Waiting... for Mirei</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke up at 6:45 today, willing to snuggle for a few more minutes but obviously ready to get up and start his day. He ate more lightly this morning than usual but made up for it tonight! </p>
<p>It's a school day and after his dad reminded him about it, he clearly stated and with great feeling "Riku not go to school today!" Bryn handled it very well, saying it was a school day, but tomorrow was the weekend. He also took a special treat along with him, a piece of caramel chocolate to give to him when he left him. </p>
<p>Bryn came home at 9:15 telling us it had gone more smoothly that he could have hoped for... not one comment about "no school" on the way there, no hesitency when approaching or going into the school, no tears, and just a nice "bye Daddy" when Bryn left him. What a relief to hear this; we had also reminded him when we go to pick him up he isn't ready to leave and he seems to have remembered that. </p>
<p>I answered a couple of fast emails before showering, did quite a bit of knitting, tidied up my paper work in the bedroom, and washed out a couple of blouses. Time for one more email before dashing off to meet Kei for lunch. I had invited her out on Wednesday and was so pleased her mother-in-law said she would babysit for her. </p>
<p>Akane had phoned the restaurant last night to ask if they would make a non-meat or fish broth for me, and so when we walked in at 11:50 they were prepared for me. Akane had also written a note, complete with a drawing, of two dishes I would like. They were exactly what we had last week and were just as delicious... tofu and broccoli hot pot (it was okra last week though), and then a mixed veggie, mushroom, and more tofu! with noodle dish. Kei had never eaten here before and liked it very much. We managed to chat a lot, with a little help from Kei's dictionary at one point to find the word "labour" as I had asked her what hers was like. </p>
<p>We are invited to their home tomorrow for tea at 4 p.m. after the children's naps. Kei apologized in advance for how tiny her house is, and how crowded it is. I know that it's unusual to be invited into a Japanese home, so feel very honoured that Kei is comfortable enough with us all to do this. We managed to polish off every last bit of our lunch before I had to dash for the 1 p.m. meeting with Akane and Bryn at the train. </p>
<p>Off to Namba, one of the main shopping areas in downtown Osaka. It was bustling as usual, but we managed to be very efficient and got lots done... my bit of shopping at Uniqlo, with two new turtlenecks for myself, Bryn bought a quilted but light down jacket, off to "Afternoon Tea", a lovely shop with three floors, to look for cards (I bought a large number of these as they are so different, and yet affordable), and then into another nine-floor store, quite inexpensive, called "Tokyu Hands", but nothing there tempted me at all. </p>
<p>We had decided to stop for a cup of tea/coffee and a dessert and had stopped in at a French cafe, but after realizing that a cup of tea in the smoky environment was going to cost $7, we decided we would leave and find something else. That ended up being four "Beard Papa's" cream puffs eaten at home. Perfect, and my tea was exactly as I like it too. </p>
<p>The train arrived here at 4:45 and we went right over to the school. Riku, as usual, was happily playing, today dragging a long apron and the ties along the floor, and interacting with another child, and one of the male teachers. Once again, he was in no hurry to leave at all, and we finally managed to corral him and get him dressed. One of the teachers told us he hadn't cried once all day, not even at nap time and had slept for an hour and 40 minutes. He ate all his salmon and vegetables at lunch time, and they were out in the playground for part of the morning. All is well, and we were all so pleased to hear it! </p>
<p>Since going to school, Riku has been carrying his dishes to the kitchen when he finishes eating here at home. They have a low sink with three taps at school and rinse out their own milk bottles and tidy up after themselves. The second time I was there to pick Riku up he was struggling to put his chair on top of another, stacking them for the next day. It may be a co-incidence but he has also been emptying the waste basket each morning from the bathroom into the kitchen garbage pail. Such a helper! </p>
<p>Bryn asked if I would take care of Riku while he and Akane went out for a sushi dinner, and of course I was happy to have the time with him. We had such a wonderful three hours together this evening. I made him porridge again for dinner with apples and almonds finely sliced into it, then he asked for toast, and had two small tomatoes after that. His dessert was two big strawberries followed by half a cream puff, that I forgot I was supposed to save for after the BM we had told Riku we wanted in the toilet tonight. He has been protesting the idea for the past two days, but it's time. </p>
<p>So, as soon as he had finished eating... which took a while!, I took off his pants and diaper, and let him wander around half naked. Eventually he felt the need to go, and let me know. I had told him we would read some books in the bathroom and we did... two Caillou books, one of which showed Caillou on the toilet! Nothing happened however, so he popped off and sat on the floor to play with his garage. A few minutes later though, he asked me if I had to use the toilet. I went along with it and sat down pretending to try to go; Riku "read" to me, and then out of the blue said "Plop!" and then said "I have a surprise for you! What would you like?" He dashed into the living room, brought me back my surprise, telling me first to "open your hands and close your eyes; I put in a big surprise!" and there was the helicopter I had always wanted! </p>
<p>I was washing the dishes when he told me again he had to go; two new books, a little concentration, and then success! He was so pleased with himself and I think we're on the way to a toilet-trained boy. </p>
<p>Face washed, teeth brushed, PJs on, one Nicky book, and fifteen minutes later I had a tired little boy sound asleep, at 7:45. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn came in not much later with chestnut gelato for me; it is delicious as it's not too sweet and with a very subtle flavour. I have 2/3 of it left for tomorrow. Unlike Riku, I ate the entire cream puff. They had had a wonderful dinner at a local spot, in a well-heeled neighbourhood, just a few blocks from the gelato spot, and were pleasantly surprised at how inexpensive it was. Bryn had a particular brand of saki, recommended by another customer, and Akane chatted with a third staff person about their pregancies; this woman too was expecting her second baby, but not as soon as Akane! Bryn said they didn't have one of the special dishes on the menu... raw horse, called "cherry blossom". Ugh! Akane isn't interested at all, and Bryn said he would have needed to have more to drink to be talked into it. </p>
<p>Akane's lower back has been aching all day, and Mirei was moving less this morning, so of course we had high hopes that today might be the day, but tonight she is on the move again, and Akane's back is still aching... maybe tomorrow.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/12/its_the_weekend_1.html">It's the Weekend!</a></h2>
								<p>... and Riku knows it well; there is no school today or tomorrow, so we have two very relaxing days in store for us. Riku woke at 7 a.m. ready to get on with his day. He played with his toys while nibbling on some "O"s, half a banana, and some juice, but didn't seem nearly so hungry this morning. His tummy must still be full from his huge dinner last night! </p>
<p>I added Gail to Bryn's Skype list and even though I don't get much of a chance to get on it (Bryn is usually working in his room during the hours when it is most convenient to talk), I managed to talk for a few minutes with both Doug and Gail this morning, as the bedroom was cold and Bryn had moved his computer into the kitchen and stopped to make himself a cup of tea. </p>
<p>A little later on Riku asked for toast, "bacon", and an egg, but didn't devour it the way he usually does. Instead he waited until I had my breakfast in front of me in a little restaurant place Akane and Bryn go to occasionally. He drank all of my delicious hot chocolate, and ate half my thick white toast, but did let me eat my hard-boiled egg after peeling it for me. He charmed the cook in the restaurant, who gave him a nice big orange when we left. He had sat so nicely while we ate, and after eating what he wanted of my meal, he did a little drawing, chatting all the while with us. </p>
<p>Bryn headed home to work (it's still Friday work day for him), while Akane, Riku, and I went to the ball room to meet up with Kei, Tomoha, Noriko, and Yui. They were there when we arrived and Shigeru came in a half hour later, much to Riku's delight. I'm sure that playroom has never seen such action! Balls were flying everywhere with Riku and Shigeru aiming at each other and the other children joining in. The gal in charge didn't seem to mind, which was great, as they all had such a great time! Riku really likes Shigeru a lot, and it's easy to see that the feeling is mutual. </p>
<p>We left at noon hour as Riku needed a good nap before continuing on with our busy afternoon... an outing to the building where Ayako works with mentally and physically challenged adults; this is one of the few days of the year where they meet up with members of the public. Following that, we were invited to tea at Kei's and Shigeru's home, an unusual event.</p>
<p>Akane was happy to nap with Riku today, so while she finished her lunch I read to Riku. I read one of the Caillou books I brought with me, and one that we have read often. I wanted him asleep quickly so started skimming a wee bit. On page three I read "Can you keep a secret, Caillou?" asks Grandpa with a smile. I read "Yes, Grandpa" leaving out the next few words. As I turned the page Riku piped up with "Caillou nods his head".... absolutely correct, so I towed the line from then on. </p>
<p>He rolled over on his side, as usual, and then, not-as-usual, told me "no singing, Nana" (I have been signing "Wheels on the Bus..", "You're My Honey Bunch..." and "Rock-a-bye-Baby" for three years to him at nap time!). And as if that weren't surprising enough went on to tell me "No sh'shing, Nana"! which I often do when I am tired of singing. Then he rolled over toward me, putting his hands on the sides of my neck, locking me in with him, kissed the end of my nose! and then said "You can sing, Nana". What a guy! He was asleep within minutes. </p>
<p>Akane crawled in with him ten minutes later and they slept, and slept, and slept for almost three hours! I got lots of emailing done, which was great. I'm not caught up but sure made a good dent in it.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we had missed the event at Ayako's, and as soon as Riku had a snack got ready to head off for tea, first stopping at the bakery downstairs to pick up some treats for our hosts. Shigeru and Tomoha met us, as planned, on Shopper's Road, as it is very difficult to give directions here. Only the main roads have names and there are so many tiny lanes and side-streets that not even the taxi drivers know how to find many of the homes. Not only do the streets not have names but the houses don't all have addresses either! It was a good thing he met us, as we made so many turns we would have had trouble with all but the very best of directions. </p>
<p>Kei and family live in a walk up apartment and even though Kei had warned me twice that their home was very tiny, I was surprised to find how tiny it really was. And yet somehow they have managed to fill it with books for the adults and Tomoha, and toys, and magazines... all in a space smaller than one can imagine. We all sat in the warmer tatami room while the children played around us. Kei served tea and cookies, and we chatted with Akane occasionally filling in as translator. We saw several photos of Tomoha all decked out in her tiny red formal kimono, and several photos of Kei and Shigeru before Tomoha was born. Tomoha sat and looked at the little photo album I made and mailed to her in the summer, and carried around the cream-filled Santa bread I had bought for her (and one for Riku too). </p>
<p>We stayed just an hour, as it was dinner time for Riku, and a very very cold night outside too. We live only about a fifteen walk from them, if that, but it seemed much longer in the cold. Riku was happy to walk home with his daddy though, holding hands in the dark.</p>
<p>I made mac' and cheese for Riku's dinner, with lots of veggies in it; he ate some of the pasta Akane made for her and Bryn's dinner, and finished off with some vanilla pudding with strawberries he hadn't finished at his snacktime this afternoon. He watched some of "Monsters Inc." during dinner, but played with some toys he had piled on the table as well.</p>
<p>I have started telling him how many minutes he has left to play by pointing it out on the hands of the clock (tonight the hands were at the top), but he is a smart little fellow and bought himself a little more playing time by reminding us of his medicine, followed by a drink, which also takes some time to finish. </p>
<p>Into his PJs, Bryn brushed his teeth, and off he went with "Frog and Toad are Friends" for his story tonight. Somehow he talked me into two of them tonight, but was asleep at 8:30, despite all the extras. </p>
<p>Computer time; Akane decided to watch TV tonight, which worked out so well for me. I'm sure she knew I would want to do my blog. </p>
<p>And no baby for us today... today is the due date from the U.S. doctor, but we still have tomorrow to make that work for us, as tomorrow is the 17th there! We get two tries at it...  </p>
<p>p.s. Riku got a brand new pillow today, just like his Mom's special one. He had a wonderful nap, staying in one spot. I have high hopes that this will mean he doesn't try to hog mine at night and even try using my head as a pillow, with me laying lower and lower on the bed trying to find a spot on my own!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/12/underwear_boy.html">Underwear Boy!</a></h2>
								<p>Today started off a little differently than usual. Instead of going out into the dining/living room soon after waking, Riku decided to bring the toys into our room! He was awake at 7 a.m. and told me "Don't move". It started with just the tool box but I made the mistake of choosing to play cars which meant two more containers had to come in. Then came his car, the container of blocks, and last, but not least, the kitchen sink... really! His entire little kitchen was soon sitting beside the bed, with everything else neatly piled on top of the bed. </p>
<p>I was cold and suggested moving into the other room; his response "Oh, I sorry, here's a blanket", pulling the duvet over my feet. I gave in and had a lovely time; Riku made me a wonderful breakfast of bread "Toast? Oh, I sorry, I not have toaster, have to buy one", egg "How you like it? Oh, poached, okay, I cook it in water", and tomatoes. He gave me the pepper, after choosing it from a set of four, by seeing all the Ps on the container. We had a proper place setting too, of plates, a knife and fork, and cups. </p>
<p>He did a great job on my hot chocolate too, mixing the whole pretend works thoroughly with a spoon and then "You like cream on your hot chocolate?" making sounds of the machine as he squirted it on. What a great little cook he is. </p>
<p>I am sure we were in there for a good hour, interacting with zebra and dog, feeding them too, and finally coming out into the warmer room. The floor is heated in main room and on such a cold day that made a huge difference. </p>
<p>We had a quiet day at home. Riku has developed a little cold and his cough seems worse when he is first down for his nap or nighttime sleep, so a day inside on this cold day made sense. For the first time since I arrived, he didn't have a great appetite for breakfast. Akane made us a delicious egg, cheese, and tomato scramble with thick whole grain toast but Riku didn't eat any of it, just a few "O"s earlier and a mandarin. Akane and Bryn went downstairs for underwear for Riku and came back just as Riku was finishing his lunch. </p>
<p>He certainly made up for the morning slack, with a huge meal of oatmeal, strawberries, toast and soy milk! His tummy was so round we wondered how he could walk about. We kept him awake until 1 p.m., a little later than was ideal, since he naps at school at 2 p.m. and we are trying to make that adjustment a little easier for him. Of course, he was asleep very quickly and shortly after that Akane and Bryn headed downstairs for groceries and underwear, or so we thought. </p>
<p>Riku slept so well, and only wakened once at the almost-always forty minute mark. After that he slept for a total of two hours and forty-five minutes. I was on my own and whipped through more emails than ever at one time since arriving. It was great and I was completely caught up for the second time this trip. Of course they keep arriving but that's fine; I love to get my mail in each day and to keep in touch. </p>
<p>Once Riku awoke I turned off the computer and we played and played and played. </p>
<p>First though, after his snack I had taken his diaper off to encourage a trip to the bathroom (he had already urinated). He was chilly and so I pulled on a pair of pants and he commented "that feel funny". I remembered that he now had underwear, so pulled a pair of those on him; he was delighted and told me a little later he had to urinate! , </p>
<p>Riku had lots of energy for continuing with an airplane adventure started by his Daddy earlier. He had wrapped the duvet into a long cylindrical shape, the folded his two small futon and base for wings. We spent a good hour on this nice soft plane, with Riku taking the pilot's seat, flying us through thunder and clouds and big accidents and crashes (which Brent miraculously saved us from!) and me being a perfectly obedient passenger. </p>
<p>Riku is quite the little bossy boy these days, and I was told to do up my seat belt, to sit back, to not leave the plane to go to the bathroom, and was also put in charge of his dog, who apparently was hungry, frightened, and tired, and needed comfort or food from me regularly. I did get to be the pilot at one point, but it only lasted about three minutes as I wasn't doing something right and got shifted back into my seat again. What a fun time we had! I really wish we had a video recorder set up for some of these games as he is just so entertaining. </p>
<p>We both chatted with Doug a little bit on Skype about his upcoming trip to Toronto, leaving on Monday his time, Tuesday ours. </p>
<p>At 5:30 Riku's parents came home, having eaten a nice lunch out after taking a train to a nearby shopping centre. They are looking for a few extra gifts for Riku for Christmas and this seemed a good opportunity. It worked for Riku and me too. They brought me home an egg salad sandwich, which I ate immediately, having forgotten to eat lunch after our late breakfast, and then Riku had noodle soup, toast, 2 oranges, and banana milk gelato for dessert. </p>
<p>School tomorrow, so after some floor time with his dad, I got him into a warm bath for some wind-down time, and had him tucked into bed and asleep at 7:45. </p>
<p>Both computers were busy for most of the evening, so I got into my PJs, washed so I was ready when Riku called out, and wrote two letters... one to Tay, who is now living in Everett, Washington, and one to Neal. Then I knitted for an hour on Candy's scarf, now on the third try (I accidently pulled the stitches off a few nights ago! and messed up somehow one tired night as well), and had just started on a few emails on  Bryn's computer when Riku woke up coughing hard and crying. </p>
<p>Bryn went in with him, but Bryn is on the end of a cough problem himself, so I went off to bed about 10:45. There may be a baby here tomorrow, if Akane is right about the doctor not wanting her to wait much longer for Mirei to be born.... more sleep is good at this point. </p>
<p>p.s. At one point after dinner, Riku looked as though he was ready to have a BM in his underwear. Akane caught him just in time, his dad sat on the floor of the bathroom reading to him but it was all in vain. We were surprised that he would not tell us, when wearing diapers but I guess he is not quite ready for this. Bare bottoms might be best for a bit longer...</p>
