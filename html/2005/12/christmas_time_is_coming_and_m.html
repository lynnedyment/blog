								<h2>Christmas Time is Coming... and Maybe Mirei Too!</h2>
								<p>Tonight, before bedtime, Riku was taking tiny ornaments from little drawers under a wooden Advent Christmas tree his Baa-ba and Jiiji gave to him the year he was born. How he enjoyed it this year, with such pleasure in unwapping each one, and exclaiming over it before hanging in on the tree... all the while singing "Christmas time is coming". </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the tatami room next door his parents were sitting on the futon. In between sessions of rubbing Akane's back, they were taking note of Mirei's active movements; Akane had a couple of minor contractions today and we were hoping Mirei might be born on Uncle Frank's birthday. When Riku was finished with his tree activities, he decided to join Akane and Bryn on the futon, bringing along his tool kit and some cars. At one point Bryn told him he could feel the baby moving, and with his hand on her tummy he felt her! The interest didn't last too long though, and back he went to his toys. </p>
<p>Working backwards from here... Akane went off for her 9:30 Monday appointment with her doctor, calling at 10 a.m. to say she was being taken upstairs to the birth clinic for a more thorough examination. She was 3 cm. dilated and when we arrived an hour later, Akane was ready to leave with us. </p>
<p>Riku had been looking forward to playing with the toys in the toy room here, so he was a little upset that we were leaving so soon. However, we left to catch a train, and then a bus, to Sakai City. It was a bitterly cold day and while we waited in line for the bus, Bryn went off to buy a coffee, and some hot chocolate for me. It had a nice layer of whipped cream on it, and once seated on the bus, I offered Riku a taste of it. He just loved it and saved one last swallow for me! </p>
<p>He sang "The wheels on the bus..." on the bus, making up his own verses, something he has been doing a lot of lately. He sang "Daddy on the bus says "it's okay" and "Riku on the bus says (insert coughing sound)". Riku is quite likely to burst out into song at any time of the day; he has a good memory for what he hears and now happily improvises too.  </p>
<p>We were out for a walk-in visit to a dermatogist for Riku. He has dry patches on his ankle and one wrist, which don't seem to be healing properly, so after a 55 minute wait we saw a doctor. He prescribed cortisone, which Riku uses already, and something liquid to be taken for two weeks after each meal. </p>
<p>While waiting, Riku had a great time with his dad, looking at the books in the waiting room. At one point I asked him to throw away some garbage (he and Bryn had gotten rid of some earlier) so off he went, with me not realizing the garbage can was through two sliding doors and outside! Egad! He obviously went out, threw it away, and came right back in.</p>
<p>Akane stayed downtown to do a little Christmas shopping for Riku, while Bryn and I walked him home in his stroller, hoping he would nap. He did, although for only 45 minutes. I bought egg salad sandwiches on "Shopping Road", just a few minutes from the condo, but we had hoped Riku would continue sleeping while we ate. </p>
<p>Once upstairs, Bryn got right to work, and I made "mac 'n cheese" for Riku at his request. I added mushrooms, tomatoes, carrots, and spinach to it, and he ate a big bowl while playing at the table with me. Akane came in not too much later, feeling a little blue, so she and Bryn snuggled up and had a long winter's nap together. Riku and I had a great afternoon together, playing with his garage, doing a little stenciling, and chatting and singing away. It's the best kind of day, just hanging out, and I think Riku feels the same way. At one point during the morning/afternoon out, he said "Let's go home now" and I'm glad we did so. </p>
<p>He's back to school tomorrow, but we wanted to make sure his chest was clear, so back to the local doctor we went. Bryn and I headed off with him at 5:30, after Akane had called to explain why we were coming in. Bryn's Japanese isn't up to translating whatever the doctor might tell us, but he did ask about going to school and that was fine. His chest is clear but with the occasional coughing and stuffiness, she gave him more liquid medicine to be taken after his three main meals a day. We were there for an hour and a half though, and so it was much later than I had hoped for when we got home. My plan was to have Riku asleep at 7:30; he needs to be well rested to be at school all day tomorrow and had such a short nap today. </p>
<p>He was a happy boy though, and ate a huge amount of food; he seems to be going through a growth spurt and so as well as the porridge with grated apple, and two slices of his "bacon", he asked for egg and toast and ate it all. Off he went to his Advent calendar, and from there it was a typical off to bed routine... minus the tub, which shall be replaced with a shower tomorrow. He said goodnight to his Mommy and Daddy, still sitting on the futon, contemplating Mirei's imminent (we hope!) arrival. I tucked Riku in at 8:15 and walked out the door at 8:30. </p>
<p>Quiet evening with not much computer time; Riku woke briefly a couple of times, I did some knitting (Candy's scarf), and went off to bed at 10:30 on the chance that there may be a wake-up call for Mirei during the night...</p>
