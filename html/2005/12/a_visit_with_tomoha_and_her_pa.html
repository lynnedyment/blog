								<h2>A Visit with Tomoha and Her Parents</h2>
								<p>Riku coughed only a couple of times in the night and slept right through until 7:40 this morning, eleven hours sleep for him! This is just what he needs and I hope to keep him on this track while I am here. We had our usual morning routine, with a little drawing time for Riku first thing, while eating some banana and a few bites of his cereal. I went off to shower immediately as we are to be at the clinic with Riku when it opens at 9:30; there are no appointments made here so it's first come, first served.</p>
<p>Akayo has the day off today and has offered to drive us all to the Italian restaurant we went to in May, for lunch. Riku needs to have a wee nap under his belt so that he lasts throughout the meal.</p>
<p>Akane, Riku, and I left the condo at 9:15, but there were still about six people in front of us inside the clinic. Riku was happy to sit and play with the toys and a new set of plastic building blocks, and since it wasn't nearly as busy today, we waited for only a half hour or so.</p>
<p>The verdict today: Riku's throat is almost completely free of infection with just small pockets on each side to heal. However, he has a mild case of bronchitis, and more antibiotics to take, as well as a patch to wear for 24 hours a day on his back (or chest), to help with the coughing. None of us has any idea what this patch is or how it works but later on Kei told us that Tomoha had worn one not long ago and it had worked.</p>
<p>Akane went home after the visit, and I continued on with Riku. We spent a little time in the park before our walk. There were quite a few children there today, and four dogs being exercised. Riku was quite fascinated, let a large dog lick his hand, and patted it, but was taken aback when the dog barked a loud bark at him! Riku took many trips down the slide today, standing nicely in line behind some younger children while they slowly climbed up the ladder.</p>
<p>Finally, off we went for our walk. It was quite cold out but eventually, over the next hour, the sun came out. Riku fell into a nice sleep about a half hour into the walk and then was awakened by something after just twenty minutes. It was obvious by the time he was home and we were preparing to leave at 1 p.m. that Riku wasn't going to have any fun at all eating out, and neither would we. He was talking back(!) to his dad, quite new behaviour for our little man, and had to be put in his room for a couple of minutes which made him even angrier. Bryn decided that Riku shouldn't go out after all for lunch, and I agreed, and offered to stay home with him.</p>
<p>Riku was furious, banging his little riding car around and thrashing about in anger, but within a half hour he was in a deep sleep and slept for an hour and a bit before calling out. I tried to settle him and leave but he was super-aware of my trying to sneak out, and I finally decided it was more important that he sleep than I have some computer time.</p>
<p>We had made arrangements this afternoon for Kei, her husband, and Tomoha to come over later, after his nap. I'm sure he would have slept longer but when he rolled over at 4 p.m. I didn't encourage him to go back to sleep.</p>
<p>At 4:30 our visitors arrived, but Riku was not in a wonderful mood for this first visit at home. He is sick, and probably would have napped for another half hour so wasn't up to Tomoha playing with his toys. She just moved on to the next item of interest and eventually Riku just let it go and played independently with something else too. Tomoha's dad (I have forgotten his name) asked Bryn to check his translation paper for a class he is taking, written from Japanese to English. Bryn said it was pretty good and made just a couple of corrections. Tei and Akane chatted a bit, and I asked some questions, which Akane translated when I couldn't make myself understood.</p>
<p>We sat on the floor in the living/dining room while the children played, and after an hour or so had a little birthday celebration for Tomoha, who turns three on the 16th. I gave Tomoha a Raffi CD, since her parents would very much like her to speak English (they sing to her from song sheets), and a tiny birthday book featuring a mouse, which Riku also has. They gave Riku two Matchbox-type vehicles, which he painstakingly worked on getting out of the blister packs and succeeded with just a little bit of help from his parents. He was determined to do it all himself but it would have been hard for me to do so.</p>
<p>We decided to do this early so that Akane and Bryn could meet them all; once Akane goes into labour there will be no opportunity for a visit like this.</p>
<p>By the end of the visit Riku was being the perfect little host, offering around a tray of apple slices and making sure that Tomoha got the slices without the skin. He tried to stop her dad at one point from taking one of them. He played at the table at one point with his Play-Doh, which left Tomoha free to play with whatever she wanted to... his kitchen set, his firehouse, and his singing book, as well as his riding car. We took a few group photos and a few of the children, and said goodbye around 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Quick dinner for Riku... kabocha squash, followed by oatmeal, followed by a really rich chocolate pudding with some powder from the doctor sprinkled on it... not sure what it is. He took his liquid antibiotic, and had his daddy put his PJs on, as well as the patch, or "sticker" as he put it. Teeth brushed, a little TV on daddy's lap, and tucked in by mommy(!) at 9:15 after Akane read him three Japanese storybooks. I cleaned up the toys and the kitchen. Oh, Riku spent some time running around with a bare bottom, a rare event, as he doesn't like to do this, a top on, and at one point the tea cozy, which made him look like a sultan!</p>
<p>Riku is changing quickly these days... he is getting into things he has never been curious about... the kitchen drawers, the refrigerator drawers, rolling the chair over to see what is on the kitchen counters, asking if he can have a cough drop, thinking it's a candy, and just generally being more assertive about what he wants to do and when he wants to do it. I think he is having his two-year year in his third! Oh yes, this may well be a very challenging year, especially with the baby on her way soon.</p>
<p>He's also saying things he has never said, showing his feelings about things he isn't happy about by saying he will crash them, or break them, complete with arm movements letting us know how he will do this. Today he told me the baby wouldn't come out(!) and he would crash the school, something he said a few days ago too. Ah yes, the child is changing and will need some gentle handling in the next year or so. He is letting his opinions be known in no uncertain terms!</p>
<p>He and his mom are both now sleeping soundly in <b>my</b> bed! ... well, Riku's and my bed. I'm off to get my PJs on, do a little emailing, and get to bed in an hour or so...</p>
<p>Funny comment from Riku tonight; we were talking about how big Akane's tummy is and Bryn asked Riku what was in there... his reply, "A <b>big</b> chocolate!"</p>
<p>Night night...</p>
