								<h2>Introducing the New "Theatrical Three" Boy</h2>
								<p>I mentioned yesterday, I believe, about how Riku has been changing dramatically before our eyes these past few days. It is really astounding to watch all this happen. Riku has opinions about everything from what he is going to eat and not eat, to whom he wants to dress him, and which lucky person puts him to bed. But it's not only that; he is having long conversations about things in the past, such as movies he has watched, and for which he has am amazing memory for detail. He has decided that he doesn't always need to look at the camera, just because it's there, and that he can at least say "No Daddy, no Nana" when asked who is going to put his PJs on. The fact that those are the only two choices makes no difference at all. </p>
<p>Tonight he and Bryn had a longer than five minute discussion about the movie they saw together some time ago, "Spirited Away". Riku started off by saying "Remember when we saw the show about 'Spirited Away'"?", and then went on to talk about various things that happened, and try so hard to ask about one segment that didn't ring a bell with either of his parents. It was astounding to listen to this; we keep saying it's like having a brand new person in our midst! </p>
<p>We both woke at 7 this morning, although I think Riku may well have been awake before me, just patiently waited for me to show some signs of being awake... and then saying "good morning" with a big smile to ensure that I wouldn't dream of drifting back to sleep. He is so quiet that it amazes me. Today we pretended there was a ghost coming into the room and we both ducked under the duvet and kept quiet. When it was safe we got out from our hiding place, but with our monster spray handy. </p>
<p>Usual morning routine around here; at one point Riku was starting to fade and be a little grouchy, so I planned to tuck him into bed. He had a big mid-morning snack of egg and tomatoes, after telling me he was hungry when bedtime was suggested. </p>
<p>This is an old ploy of Amelia's and I wonder if she got the word out to him that this worked. He did seem to perk up, however, and a little playtime with his dad seemed to revive him. </p>
<p>I had lots of email time this morning, and made good use of it by answering a huge number of emails that had been stacking up over the past week. Akane was sweeping and vacuuming and then lay down to read; Riku happily entertained himself for most of the morning, although we did take time for some colouring and pretend meal time too. He likes a little interaction now and then and it's always fun to hear what is going on in his mind. </p>
<p>We had our first Skype with Susan and Amelia today, or at least Riku and I did. We could hear Bryn talking to someone and Riku leaned over and said to me "Who Daddy talking to?". I said I didn't know and so he leaned over a little further and said "What he talking about?" After listening for about thirty seconds he went back to making me lunch, after saying "I not know what he talking about." When I told him I thought it might be Auntie Susan, he immediately got down from the chair and went into the bedroom to say hello. It was so sweet to hear Amelia's voice. Every once in a while she would come in and say "hi" and Riku would do the same. I sang her our new song about the currant buns, and learned that they are going off to buy their Christmas tree. What fun they will have, and Susan will take lots of photos, I'm sure. Kevin's mom is visiting from Alaska, which makes it even more special an event. </p>
<p>Riku was a great little chef and waiter today. He went in and fed his mom while she was lying in bed, using all of his pretend food and dishes. Then it was my turn; he knows I don't eat fish so when he offered it, he immediately said "oh no, you not eat fish!" and put it aside, offering me pizza, a big mushroom, a tomato, and corn on the cob. I asked for butter and he gave me a pretend dab of it, and when I asked for pepper went over and came back with the correct shaker out of a choice of curry, paprika, and salt. We spent a little time yesterday spelling out pepper and repeating it over the course of yesterday's pretend meals. Riku gets more pleasure out of his little kitchen than I would have imagined. I would love to have one in San Francisco for all the children. And I like being catered to, by such a handsome little chef! </p>
<p>Bryn came out from his "office", the master bedroom, to tell me we were going out for lunch, to a nearby tofu restaurant. This sounded like a great plan, and at 12:30 we set out for this small spot just five minutes away. While Akane and Bryn were at the bank, Riku and I walked up to say "hello" to the woman at the clothing store. She came out beaming away at him, held him and gave him a big hug. I took a photo of them, and she showed him off to two new women in her shop, asking him how old he was, what his name was, and clapping when he finished singing the ABC song to them. He is so obviously feeling much better today, thank goodness. </p>
<p>Wouldn't you know it? The tofu restaurant is no longer serving lunch. I am destined not to eat in a specialty tofu shop in Japan, it seems! They also make cheesecake, and Riku had a small sample; he liked it very much and Bryn bought a half dozen quite small servings for home. </p>
<p>Akane suggested another small neighbourhood place, one that I had been to in May and liked very much. Bryn had not been there before, and I was more than happy to eat there again. I had the most delicious hot pot with vegetables in a mushroom broth, with tofu instead of shrimp, thanks to Akane speaking with the waiter. Riku ate lots of Akane's noodles, and some of the hot pot, and kept himself busy with Bryn's and my credit cards. I had neglected to take along the books I usually take out with us. We had a second dish of noodles with vegetables and tofu as well, so I had my tofu fix anyway. </p>
<p>Riku was doing a bit of flirting with a family sitting nearby. The father was paying lots of attention to Riku, and when we left the teenage daughter picked Riku up and gave him a hug. He has his little fan club for sure in Japan! </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn stopped for a coffee together, while Riku and I walked through the park, and then came up for another little cheesecake (he had one for dessert in the restaurant too), and tuck in time. It was 2:20 when he fell asleep (I had to hold him for about one full minute before he gave in in my arms, after fooling around rolling over, and playing with the curtains, etc. etc. before I took a different tack.) and he woke at 5:30! He woke a few times but was back asleep within one minute each time, and finally at 5:30 I turned off the noise machine and left the door open. Not one cough the whole time! </p>
<p>Oh, when we came in from lunch, Riku as always opened the door with the key. I said to him "One day, Riku, your sister Mirei will open the door with the key" to which Riku replied, "Nana will say 'Oh no, Mirei, you are too little'."</p>
<p>I think he would have slept longer, as I had to hold him wrapped in his blanket for the longest time, forty-five minutes or so while he watched his TV show. Finally, he came around, telling us he wanted to have egg, "bacon", and toast. Akane made up a plate for him with a little tomato too, and it all disappeared... as did some veggie/fruit juice, fresh crackers his parents bought when they were out, then apple juice, and some oatmeal, some "O"s, and the thick pudding with his medicine sprinkled on it. We wondered where it was all going, but knew when we picked him up. It felt like he had gained five pounds tonight! </p>
<p>Akane made me up a big bowl of a dish made of the tofu I bought the other day with some nice big carrot slices and a tasty sauce. Yum! I was pretty full from lunch and the bananas we are trying to use up, but I know what I'll be having for lunch tomorrow. </p>
<p>He and Bryn had lots of play time: "Dad, let's play! What should we do? Build something? Okay. Oh, that looks like a castle!", and when they built a structure with the wooden tools he declared that it was wobbly. I wish I had a tape recorder with me for all of this chatter. He has so much to say and has such fun just playing and chatting. </p>
<p>They watched about an hour of "The Incredibles" with Riku sitting on Bryn's lap and discussing it all. I was the bad guy and insisted it was bedtime at 9 p.m. He was drooping for sure, and despite his long nap looked like he needed his bed. There was a bit of a struggle with PJs but his dad took over, and by the time it was teeth brushing and face washing time he was fine. He did, however, protest about the patch on his back for the coughing, saying "NO STICKER!" The sticker, needless to say, is in place. </p>
<p>I read him a story and his mom tucked him in... too late but tomorrow is another day and may involve a morning nap. It's the weekend for us, starting at 2 p.m. when Bryn is officially off work, until Tuesday here. This weekend the crib goes up; perhaps this is what Mirei is waiting for, or at least that is what Akane and I suggested to Bryn.</p>
<p>p.s. This morning Bryn and I were commenting on how Riku is changing so quickly right now and I said there had to be a term for three year olds as there is for the terrific twos as I always referred to them... Bryn came up with "theatrical threes" which says it perfectly. He checked it on the Web and it was mentioned in only about fifteen places so I am very pleased to claim it for us too!</p>
