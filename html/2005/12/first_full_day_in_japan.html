								<h2>First Full Day in Japan</h2>
								<p>Riku and I both awoke at 6:45 this morning. Riku rolled over, checked to see that my eyes were open, and then gave me the biggest morning grin a person could hope for. He had a good night's sleep, although he coughed off and on, and he was having trouble breathing. We lay there for about ten minutes chatting and reading the book we had read last night, "Where's Nicky?", a new lift-the-flap book featuring one of his favourite book characters. Today was a school day, so I put out Riku's breakfast of choice... "circles", two halves of a banana (one of which was mine but he ate both!), a cup of his old favourite juice here (a vegetable and fruit mixture), and three quarters of a piece of toast. We had a little play time before it was time to get dressed and leave.</p>
<p>Riku wasn't happy at the prospect of going to school; he said "no teacher, no school" and when I asked him if he would show me his school, he agreed that he would, but followed that statement by saying he wouldn't go in. Guess he just intended to wave a hand at it as we went by! Akane was carrying a new mini-futon and cover for his nap time, and I went along to see his school, with Riku protesting all the short way along that he wasn't going.</p>
<p>By the time we had climbed up the stairs, Riku was in tears and wanted holding. The other children were in the playground on the main level, and we wandered around the spacious and bright room on our room, with Riku reluctantly showing me the toys. We went into the napping area and both lay down on the floor; it felt nice and cozy and Akane unpacked his bedding and put it in the cupboard. He came around at this point and we went back out into the main room, when one of the teachers came up and suggested we go down to the playground. Protesting right up to getting his shoes back on, we went down to join the few other children in his group, and reluctantly Riku showed me the big rubber funnels and flower pots; before long he was happily digging in the sand and making cakes. I told him we had to go to the bank; his response was "You coming right back?" but I told him we would be back later. One funny thing happened while we were in the playground; a couple of the other childen heard Riku calling me "Nana" and so two of them called me that as well to get my attention. Very cute.</p>
<p>Akane and I strolled back to the condo, a mere five minutes away, and tried unsuccessfully to go the bank. Someone was in the booth for a long time and another person was waiting, so we gave up for now. I ate some oatmeal earlier in the morning and had a piece of toast with peanut butter (I brought it with me), and then got busy unpacking. This took a good long while; I got out the several books for Riku, some old favourites like "Small Pig" and a couple of Caillou books he got for his  birthday, but read only once or twice before leaving for Japan. My clothes are sorted and in place in my room, the food in the cupboards, and the suitcases stored away in the storage room at the front of the unit. Bryn was busy working away and Akane went off with Ayako at 11:30 to spend Ayako's day off together.</p>
<p>Bryn wasn't feeling well; he had cramps in his stomach and was only comfortable lying down. I was sitting reading at the table, got squirmy after a bit and decided to lie down on the futon in the tatami room. I may have read for ten minutes and awoke three hours later! I was very surprised at this since I had fallen asleep last night no later than 10:30 and had slept very well. I didn't feel groggy after I woke, so I must have needed it to cope with the jet lag I wasn't aware of. Bryn went to bed as well, and since the computer was in his room, I didn't get on until later. I knew my sisters and Doug would be checking to see how the trip was too, but I knew Bryn's computer wouldn't be available. Akane's was in the bedroom as well but I wasn't tracking well enough to have thought to have Bryn bring it out for me.</p>
<p>Bryn and I had time for a chat catching up on my New Year's plan, and various other bits of information we haven't had time for the past couple of weeks. Kelly had told him they wouldn't be giving up the puppy after all, so that was good news. I knew that was going to be so hard on the children. Before we knew it, Akane was home and it was time to pick up Riku. We all went over and Riku was playing in what Bryn says is his usual spot, the little kitchen. Riku was busily stirring up a pot of something delicious and took time to look up and beam at us, and get right back to it. A few minutes later we were on our way home, walking a bit through that old familiar park across the way.</p>
<p>Riku was a happy boy to get home; he and I came right to the apartment while Akane and Bryn went to the grocery store first. Riku spotted the doctor kit I brought from home, and immediately started taking my temperature, checking my heart, ears, and blood pressure, and giving me a needle after first cleaning it with cotton puffs. I added these to the kit and he just thinks they are the greatest addition to his kit. I must say that Dr. Dyment sounds awfully good to both his mom and me, and I am sure his dad too. </p>
<p>After dinner he had a little time for Play-Doh and books, and then it was tuck-in time for a very tired little boy. I tucked him in at 7:30 but ended up staying in the room with him until 8:15; he was restless, not talking but not finding it easy to settle down either. I read my emails but went to bed at 10 p.m., when Riku woke up calling for me.</p>
