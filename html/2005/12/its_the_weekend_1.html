								<h2>It's the Weekend!</h2>
								<p>... and Riku knows it well; there is no school today or tomorrow, so we have two very relaxing days in store for us. Riku woke at 7 a.m. ready to get on with his day. He played with his toys while nibbling on some "O"s, half a banana, and some juice, but didn't seem nearly so hungry this morning. His tummy must still be full from his huge dinner last night! </p>
<p>I added Gail to Bryn's Skype list and even though I don't get much of a chance to get on it (Bryn is usually working in his room during the hours when it is most convenient to talk), I managed to talk for a few minutes with both Doug and Gail this morning, as the bedroom was cold and Bryn had moved his computer into the kitchen and stopped to make himself a cup of tea. </p>
<p>A little later on Riku asked for toast, "bacon", and an egg, but didn't devour it the way he usually does. Instead he waited until I had my breakfast in front of me in a little restaurant place Akane and Bryn go to occasionally. He drank all of my delicious hot chocolate, and ate half my thick white toast, but did let me eat my hard-boiled egg after peeling it for me. He charmed the cook in the restaurant, who gave him a nice big orange when we left. He had sat so nicely while we ate, and after eating what he wanted of my meal, he did a little drawing, chatting all the while with us. </p>
<p>Bryn headed home to work (it's still Friday work day for him), while Akane, Riku, and I went to the ball room to meet up with Kei, Tomoha, Noriko, and Yui. They were there when we arrived and Shigeru came in a half hour later, much to Riku's delight. I'm sure that playroom has never seen such action! Balls were flying everywhere with Riku and Shigeru aiming at each other and the other children joining in. The gal in charge didn't seem to mind, which was great, as they all had such a great time! Riku really likes Shigeru a lot, and it's easy to see that the feeling is mutual. </p>
<p>We left at noon hour as Riku needed a good nap before continuing on with our busy afternoon... an outing to the building where Ayako works with mentally and physically challenged adults; this is one of the few days of the year where they meet up with members of the public. Following that, we were invited to tea at Kei's and Shigeru's home, an unusual event.</p>
<p>Akane was happy to nap with Riku today, so while she finished her lunch I read to Riku. I read one of the Caillou books I brought with me, and one that we have read often. I wanted him asleep quickly so started skimming a wee bit. On page three I read "Can you keep a secret, Caillou?" asks Grandpa with a smile. I read "Yes, Grandpa" leaving out the next few words. As I turned the page Riku piped up with "Caillou nods his head".... absolutely correct, so I towed the line from then on. </p>
<p>He rolled over on his side, as usual, and then, not-as-usual, told me "no singing, Nana" (I have been signing "Wheels on the Bus..", "You're My Honey Bunch..." and "Rock-a-bye-Baby" for three years to him at nap time!). And as if that weren't surprising enough went on to tell me "No sh'shing, Nana"! which I often do when I am tired of singing. Then he rolled over toward me, putting his hands on the sides of my neck, locking me in with him, kissed the end of my nose! and then said "You can sing, Nana". What a guy! He was asleep within minutes. </p>
<p>Akane crawled in with him ten minutes later and they slept, and slept, and slept for almost three hours! I got lots of emailing done, which was great. I'm not caught up but sure made a good dent in it.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we had missed the event at Ayako's, and as soon as Riku had a snack got ready to head off for tea, first stopping at the bakery downstairs to pick up some treats for our hosts. Shigeru and Tomoha met us, as planned, on Shopper's Road, as it is very difficult to give directions here. Only the main roads have names and there are so many tiny lanes and side-streets that not even the taxi drivers know how to find many of the homes. Not only do the streets not have names but the houses don't all have addresses either! It was a good thing he met us, as we made so many turns we would have had trouble with all but the very best of directions. </p>
<p>Kei and family live in a walk up apartment and even though Kei had warned me twice that their home was very tiny, I was surprised to find how tiny it really was. And yet somehow they have managed to fill it with books for the adults and Tomoha, and toys, and magazines... all in a space smaller than one can imagine. We all sat in the warmer tatami room while the children played around us. Kei served tea and cookies, and we chatted with Akane occasionally filling in as translator. We saw several photos of Tomoha all decked out in her tiny red formal kimono, and several photos of Kei and Shigeru before Tomoha was born. Tomoha sat and looked at the little photo album I made and mailed to her in the summer, and carried around the cream-filled Santa bread I had bought for her (and one for Riku too). </p>
<p>We stayed just an hour, as it was dinner time for Riku, and a very very cold night outside too. We live only about a fifteen walk from them, if that, but it seemed much longer in the cold. Riku was happy to walk home with his daddy though, holding hands in the dark.</p>
<p>I made mac' and cheese for Riku's dinner, with lots of veggies in it; he ate some of the pasta Akane made for her and Bryn's dinner, and finished off with some vanilla pudding with strawberries he hadn't finished at his snacktime this afternoon. He watched some of "Monsters Inc." during dinner, but played with some toys he had piled on the table as well.</p>
<p>I have started telling him how many minutes he has left to play by pointing it out on the hands of the clock (tonight the hands were at the top), but he is a smart little fellow and bought himself a little more playing time by reminding us of his medicine, followed by a drink, which also takes some time to finish. </p>
<p>Into his PJs, Bryn brushed his teeth, and off he went with "Frog and Toad are Friends" for his story tonight. Somehow he talked me into two of them tonight, but was asleep at 8:30, despite all the extras. </p>
<p>Computer time; Akane decided to watch TV tonight, which worked out so well for me. I'm sure she knew I would want to do my blog. </p>
<p>And no baby for us today... today is the due date from the U.S. doctor, but we still have tomorrow to make that work for us, as tomorrow is the 17th there! We get two tries at it...  </p>
<p>p.s. Riku got a brand new pillow today, just like his Mom's special one. He had a wonderful nap, staying in one spot. I have high hopes that this will mean he doesn't try to hog mine at night and even try using my head as a pillow, with me laying lower and lower on the bed trying to find a spot on my own!</p>
