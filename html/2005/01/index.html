								<h2><a href="/2005/01/ah_san_francisco_and_amelia.html">Ah, San Francisco... and Amelia!</a></h2>
								<p>Well, here I am, back to my SF routine... I "Skyped" with my siblings in the morning, and then phoned Amelia to say "hello". It was such fun to hear her say "Nana!" in a big voice once she recognized my voice; Susan put her on speaker phone and we had a little chat. </p>
<p>Susan had an appointment early this afternoon, so I drove over to Ashbury Street in time to feed Amelia her lunch. What fun it was to see her again, to see that little face light up, and her eyes squinch up as she flirted with me. </p>
<p>After lunch we headed off for a long walk and a nap for Amelia. We had a perfect walk in Golden Gate Park today. It was hard not to think of the freezing cold weather I left behind me yesterday as I admired the California poppies already blooming and watched the gardeners out in full force, planting English primroses and pansies.  </p>
<p>Amelia napped for a full two hours as I walked my usual route... past the Conservatory, through the rose garden, and around Stow Lake twice. The day got warmer as I pushed the stroller along and there were lots of folks enjoying the balmy weather. How good it felt to have a good long walk again; it has been a long while!  </p>
<p>We arrived home just minutes before Susan, so we spent some time together over tea and homemade cookies and watching Amelia push the stroller around the kitchen and hallway. What a busy girl she is and she loves to have someone with her at all times. Big changes, as she now climbs up on the dining room chairs, shows no fear or hesitation at all, and just moves on to the next activity. I missed this little girl so much and it's grand to be home!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/01/amelia_and_a_lovely_long_day_w.html">Amelia... And  A Lovely Long Day With Her</a></h2>
								<p>I keep thinking I will get my suitcases completely unpacked and put away, but with lying in bed being very lazy and reading, then Skyping with whichever of my siblings is on that day, and having a leisurely breakfast, the mornings disappear and then it's time for something much more fun! </p>
<p>Today I asked Susan if Amelia could come and spend some time here with me here and so at 10:15 a little girl showed up, ready for her nap. Perfect timing... off we went for a long walk through the Mission District. We started off by heading to a quieter part of the Mission, which worked out well as Amelia was asleep within fifteen minutes. Then we headed off to the hills... all the way up to Noe Valley, with Amelia sleeping through all the noise that used to waken her. Two hours later I needed a bathroom break, so stopped at the house, and Doug took over for the extra half hour of Amelia's nap. </p>
<p>What a hungry girl she was by the time I served her lunch. Susan makes the most wonderful meals for her... lots of assortment and plenty of it all. Today she had homemade macaroni and cheese, sweet potato, and avocado, followed by a container of fresh tiny bite-sized fruit... blueberries, raspberries, banana, and pears. After polishing off all of this Amelia ate a little yogurt and a biscuit. Wow! </p>
<p>Then the fun started; Amelia remembered BabyType on the computer, so spent five minutes making lots of noise on the keyboard, played with a few musical instruments, kissed a frog, perused some books, played upstairs in the tent and with a big container of plastic toys, and pulled out lots of stuffed animals, carrying them around and depositing them about in the living room. Amelia was quite enamoured of the water baby and gave her lots of cuddles while rocking her. I also gave her some water play time in the kitchen sink which kept her very busy and very happy for the longest time... as well as a little bit wet! </p>
<p>The funniest bit for today was watching Amelia convincing Doug to get off the computer by going over to him, taking a firm hold on his finger and then pulling him along to wherever she wanted to explore next. A couple of times Doug told her he was busy but she wasn't having any of it; with such a grip on his finger there was no choice but for him to go along with it. </p>
<p>Susan arrived bearing a very generous portion of her delicious homemade cheesecake with fruit topping, some freshly baked chocolate chip cookies, two bunches of not-quite opened daffodils and a dozen Clementines. It's unclear how I can possibly thank her for sharing this wonderful little girl with me! That big enthusiastic "Nana!" might possibly be the best  gift of all for me. Lucky me.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/01/saturday_in_sf.html">Saturday in SF</a></h2>
								<p>My first Saturday at home in over a month and the day flew by; hard to imagine that I was watching the children ski just a week ago! </p>
<p>Doug and I had appointments at 11 a.m. for our Green Card renewals and had planned to see an early movie as soon as we finished. However, an anti-choice parade along the Embaradero thwarted our plans; there were hundreds of protesters and traffic was tied up for blocks. </p>
<p>That meant that we had time for lunch before a slightly later movie... good news for me as I had a baked tofu sandwich with pesto, roasted red peppers, red onions, and mixed greens and happily sat in the theatre savouring every bite of it. Yum! </p>
<p>After the just okay movie we drove home to check our email; we were home for just over an hour. It was a busy hour though as Candy called on Skype with the news that she has bronchitis! She sounded terrible and I called her on the phone to chat so that I could hear her more clearly. Kelly also called briefly; she and Gregg have spent the day in the CM/Gregg office decluttering, clearing, cleaning etc. We talked for just a few minutes before Doug and I went off at 5:20 to babysit Amelia. </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin were attending a post-Christmas party at a friend's house so I got to feed Amelia her dinner, give her a bath, read her stories, and tuck her into bed. What a delight Amelia is! She is funny and tender and sweet as can be. </p>
<p>After she settled down Doug and I watched the last half of the Golden Globe Awards which was interesting to see. Next week the Academy Awards will be announced and we'll be watching that for sure. </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin arrived home just after 11 p.m. after a pleasant evening out, and we headed home for bed. I read a little longer than I thought I would but sleep came easily... </p>
<p>p.s. A huge snow storm hit Ottawa, Niagara Falls and Toronto today; I left just in time...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/01/new_beds.html">New beds!</a></h2>
								<p>Ah, a lazy Sunday... at least the morning was, as I sat in bed and finished up my latest book, a crime novel. Chatted with Gail on Skype for a bit about her visit to emergency last night with a hot and swollen arm; what caused it is still a mystery with no real answer, buta heavy dose of antibiotics seems to have taken care of it. </p>
<p>Bryn came over to lend us his car for a trip to IKEA in Palo Alto. They had the twin bed frames in that we need to complete the front bedroom. Yahoo! We also bought bright "spring" coloured sheets, duvet covers, and matching pillow cases, as well as twin duvets. </p>
<p>After a delicious lunch at a tiny restaurant in Mountain View... shared taro egg rolls, a big tofu vegetable dish for me, and Doug's favourite broccoli with "beef" for him, we headed for home, full and happy. </p>
<p>Bryn helped Doug carry the heavy frames upstairs and stayed around long enough for me to make him a sandwich and check out the latest Ofoto pics that I annotated two nights ago. He had spent the day working at home and headed home for more of the same. </p>
<p>I called Riku and Akane and was lucky enough to catch them at home. They are heading out with Ayako later on, but Riku listened to me telling him all about things here at home... his room, a couple of songs, what's happening with the house that had caught fire (a very fascinating neighbourhood event for Riku), and laughed when his Grandpa said "Riku, Riku, Riku" to him in the familiar way he has said it for a long time now. I can't wait until they are home again; it seems too long since I've seen that little face. Doug put a "wallpaper" slice show of photos on my computer the other day and seeing Riku over and over on the screen makes us realize how much we miss Riku's big smiles. </p>
<p>Laundry, a light dinner eaten in front of the tv upstairs, the final two episodes of a Masterpiece Theatre piece, and it's bedtime.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/01/riku_and_nana_locked_behind_ba.html">Riku and Nana... Locked Behind Bars!</a></h2>
								<p>Well, you will just have to read on to hear all about it. There were police involved too! What a day! </p>
<p>It started off with my usual chat with my sisters at 7 a.m. I was up and showered and had answered a couple of emails when we started talking and Glenn came on as well for a bit. </p>
<p>I dashed off to the SF General Hospital to have my second TB test checked. It was a gorgeous warm morning and I slipped off my jacket on the way back home, and turned off the heat in the house too. The house takes a while to warm up in the mornings but it wasn't going to take long today! </p>
<p>I spent a productive, if non-exciting day at home, getting the laundry done, finding places to put the last of the games/books/cards that I brought back from Kelly's, and sorting through the seemingly endless pile of paper work. I dread doing it as much as I dread trying to get to the bottom of my email list. There really aren't enough hours in the day and I wish I didn't need seven hours sleep a night. </p>
<p>I did take a break mid-day though, and had a long catch-up-on -our-lives chat with Liz Lawless, who had sent an email (not the first), asking where in the world I was, and was I breathing, etc! I have been terribly neglectful of my friends but finding time to make a phone call and not be behind somewhere else in my day is proving more and more difficult. I suppose I will be catching up at some point though... hard to imagine there was no time for a visit with Liz in Ontario but it was an unusually busy time there this year. </p>
<p>By 4:15 I needed some fresh air and a walk, so at 4:30 met Akane and Riku at our favourite local playground. They had been downtown for a few hours and Akane went on home for a quiet cup of tea, no doubt. </p>
<p>Riku played in the sandbox for a bit, then spent lots of time climbing up and down the ladder to the slide. He really enjoys the slide now, and has since he returned from Ontario at the end of November. He just beams every single time he slides down. Our little man is also very keen to climb those stairs completely on his own, with no help, or supervision either, thank you very much! </p>
<p>I noticed the indoor playroom was open, and knowing how much Riku enjoys playing in there, off we went. Well, what a character Riku is! He tumbled around on the mats, deliberately falling, fell over a big red ball which also meant he had to tumble backwards on the mat, chased and was chased by a bigger girl... the highlight of his time there for sure! and dunked the ball in the basketball net. Oh, and crawled in and out of the four sectioned tunnel/house unit they have there, flattening it by the time he and another child were finished playing. Go, go, go! and he did! </p>
<p>At 5:55 p.m. the fellow in charge turned out the lights, so off we went to Riku's stroller, which was parked about half way down the playground. I was talking to him, giving him his snack, and doing up his seat belt when I noticed the fellow locking the front gate. In the back of my mind I thought that I would go out the side gate, which is usually where I exit anyway. However, the man got into his car and pulled quickly away. I did wonder if he was going to drive around the corner to lock the second gate, but that's all I did... wonder about it. </p>
<p>Not one minute later I realized that Riku and I were locked in the playground; there is a big fence along both sides, and both had sturdy locks attached to them! Well, what a dilemna! The only phone is in the locked building, I have no cell phone, and very few people were walking by us. However, I did ask one woman who passed if she could call 911 for us, and she did so. I was put on hold!, and since her phone was billed from another town, she asked another passer-by if we could use his phone. Once again I was put on hold and decided to call Bryn instead and have him solve our problem for us. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, while waiting for Bryn, Riku and I had quite a time discussing our situation. He was pulling on the gate, and saying "man lock", and "need key" and "funny!" which it was. I knew it wasn't a serious situation and that we would be out soon, so we chatted and watched people looking at us until Bryn arrived. It was quite the "zoo" experience for us and odd that even though people walking by and driving by saw us there, not one person asked if we needed help! </p>
<p>While waiting, Bryn had called Doug to say that Riku and I were behind bars with two policemen on hand!... and then explained the situation to Doug. Funny indeed! We all chatted away with the two very friendly police officers, young and patient, while we all waited for the officer with a big set of keys. Riku meanwhile had discovered that a black and white cat was hiding in the back of the park so off he went, trying so hard to catch it, with no luck at all. He enjoyed walking around in the dark though until Bryn called to tell us we were free!<br />
Riku was given a police sticker badge which he all the way home,  crumpled up in his hand.  </p>
<p>And so ends our big adventure. Riku went off home to see his mom and tell her and Brent all about our exciting tale and I walked home thinking what a funny story this would make!</p>
