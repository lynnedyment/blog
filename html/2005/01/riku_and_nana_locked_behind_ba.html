								<h2>Riku and Nana... Locked Behind Bars!</h2>
								<p>Well, you will just have to read on to hear all about it. There were police involved too! What a day! </p>
<p>It started off with my usual chat with my sisters at 7 a.m. I was up and showered and had answered a couple of emails when we started talking and Glenn came on as well for a bit. </p>
<p>I dashed off to the SF General Hospital to have my second TB test checked. It was a gorgeous warm morning and I slipped off my jacket on the way back home, and turned off the heat in the house too. The house takes a while to warm up in the mornings but it wasn't going to take long today! </p>
<p>I spent a productive, if non-exciting day at home, getting the laundry done, finding places to put the last of the games/books/cards that I brought back from Kelly's, and sorting through the seemingly endless pile of paper work. I dread doing it as much as I dread trying to get to the bottom of my email list. There really aren't enough hours in the day and I wish I didn't need seven hours sleep a night. </p>
<p>I did take a break mid-day though, and had a long catch-up-on -our-lives chat with Liz Lawless, who had sent an email (not the first), asking where in the world I was, and was I breathing, etc! I have been terribly neglectful of my friends but finding time to make a phone call and not be behind somewhere else in my day is proving more and more difficult. I suppose I will be catching up at some point though... hard to imagine there was no time for a visit with Liz in Ontario but it was an unusually busy time there this year. </p>
<p>By 4:15 I needed some fresh air and a walk, so at 4:30 met Akane and Riku at our favourite local playground. They had been downtown for a few hours and Akane went on home for a quiet cup of tea, no doubt. </p>
<p>Riku played in the sandbox for a bit, then spent lots of time climbing up and down the ladder to the slide. He really enjoys the slide now, and has since he returned from Ontario at the end of November. He just beams every single time he slides down. Our little man is also very keen to climb those stairs completely on his own, with no help, or supervision either, thank you very much! </p>
<p>I noticed the indoor playroom was open, and knowing how much Riku enjoys playing in there, off we went. Well, what a character Riku is! He tumbled around on the mats, deliberately falling, fell over a big red ball which also meant he had to tumble backwards on the mat, chased and was chased by a bigger girl... the highlight of his time there for sure! and dunked the ball in the basketball net. Oh, and crawled in and out of the four sectioned tunnel/house unit they have there, flattening it by the time he and another child were finished playing. Go, go, go! and he did! </p>
<p>At 5:55 p.m. the fellow in charge turned out the lights, so off we went to Riku's stroller, which was parked about half way down the playground. I was talking to him, giving him his snack, and doing up his seat belt when I noticed the fellow locking the front gate. In the back of my mind I thought that I would go out the side gate, which is usually where I exit anyway. However, the man got into his car and pulled quickly away. I did wonder if he was going to drive around the corner to lock the second gate, but that's all I did... wonder about it. </p>
<p>Not one minute later I realized that Riku and I were locked in the playground; there is a big fence along both sides, and both had sturdy locks attached to them! Well, what a dilemna! The only phone is in the locked building, I have no cell phone, and very few people were walking by us. However, I did ask one woman who passed if she could call 911 for us, and she did so. I was put on hold!, and since her phone was billed from another town, she asked another passer-by if we could use his phone. Once again I was put on hold and decided to call Bryn instead and have him solve our problem for us. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, while waiting for Bryn, Riku and I had quite a time discussing our situation. He was pulling on the gate, and saying "man lock", and "need key" and "funny!" which it was. I knew it wasn't a serious situation and that we would be out soon, so we chatted and watched people looking at us until Bryn arrived. It was quite the "zoo" experience for us and odd that even though people walking by and driving by saw us there, not one person asked if we needed help! </p>
<p>While waiting, Bryn had called Doug to say that Riku and I were behind bars with two policemen on hand!... and then explained the situation to Doug. Funny indeed! We all chatted away with the two very friendly police officers, young and patient, while we all waited for the officer with a big set of keys. Riku meanwhile had discovered that a black and white cat was hiding in the back of the park so off he went, trying so hard to catch it, with no luck at all. He enjoyed walking around in the dark though until Bryn called to tell us we were free!<br />
Riku was given a police sticker badge which he all the way home,  crumpled up in his hand.  </p>
<p>And so ends our big adventure. Riku went off home to see his mom and tell her and Brent all about our exciting tale and I walked home thinking what a funny story this would make!</p>
