								<h2>Amelia... And  A Lovely Long Day With Her</h2>
								<p>I keep thinking I will get my suitcases completely unpacked and put away, but with lying in bed being very lazy and reading, then Skyping with whichever of my siblings is on that day, and having a leisurely breakfast, the mornings disappear and then it's time for something much more fun! </p>
<p>Today I asked Susan if Amelia could come and spend some time here with me here and so at 10:15 a little girl showed up, ready for her nap. Perfect timing... off we went for a long walk through the Mission District. We started off by heading to a quieter part of the Mission, which worked out well as Amelia was asleep within fifteen minutes. Then we headed off to the hills... all the way up to Noe Valley, with Amelia sleeping through all the noise that used to waken her. Two hours later I needed a bathroom break, so stopped at the house, and Doug took over for the extra half hour of Amelia's nap. </p>
<p>What a hungry girl she was by the time I served her lunch. Susan makes the most wonderful meals for her... lots of assortment and plenty of it all. Today she had homemade macaroni and cheese, sweet potato, and avocado, followed by a container of fresh tiny bite-sized fruit... blueberries, raspberries, banana, and pears. After polishing off all of this Amelia ate a little yogurt and a biscuit. Wow! </p>
<p>Then the fun started; Amelia remembered BabyType on the computer, so spent five minutes making lots of noise on the keyboard, played with a few musical instruments, kissed a frog, perused some books, played upstairs in the tent and with a big container of plastic toys, and pulled out lots of stuffed animals, carrying them around and depositing them about in the living room. Amelia was quite enamoured of the water baby and gave her lots of cuddles while rocking her. I also gave her some water play time in the kitchen sink which kept her very busy and very happy for the longest time... as well as a little bit wet! </p>
<p>The funniest bit for today was watching Amelia convincing Doug to get off the computer by going over to him, taking a firm hold on his finger and then pulling him along to wherever she wanted to explore next. A couple of times Doug told her he was busy but she wasn't having any of it; with such a grip on his finger there was no choice but for him to go along with it. </p>
<p>Susan arrived bearing a very generous portion of her delicious homemade cheesecake with fruit topping, some freshly baked chocolate chip cookies, two bunches of not-quite opened daffodils and a dozen Clementines. It's unclear how I can possibly thank her for sharing this wonderful little girl with me! That big enthusiastic "Nana!" might possibly be the best  gift of all for me. Lucky me.</p>
