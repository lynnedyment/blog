								<h2>Riku's First Fever</h2>
								<p>Rriday Bryn had asked if we would like to go over to Hampshire Street for breakfast today, and I completely forgot about it! He called right in the nick of time though as Doug hadn't eaten. As soon as Doug had showered off we went. Bryn and Riku had been out to buy croissants at their favourite bakery, and Riku fell asleep on the car ride home. It was early, only 9 a.m. but he had wakened early too. Bryn managed to successfully transfer him to his bed and he was still sleeping when we arrived at 9:20. </p>
<p>Bryn cooked up some Yukon Gold potatoes, and scrambled eggs, there was  delicious sweet French toast-like treat to share, and warm croissants with Judi's strawberry jam. Riku woke up just as we were sitting down and ate one bite of egg and two bites of croissant with us. Akane made a pot of tea and we chatted about movies and trips coming up. </p>
<p>Doug and I walked back home and spent an hour there... Doug on the computer and I vacuuming the downstairs and tidying up the master bedroom... finding a place for puzzles that Riku and Amelia will enjoy a few years from now. </p>
<p>Off we went to see a movie, a wonderful movie called "Born into Brothels", a documentary set in Calcutta about the children of "lane workers". I think that every person in the theatre had tears in their eyes at the end of it; it was beautifully told and yet both sad and happy. </p>
<p>We stopped to pick up Riku at 3:10 so Akane and Bryn could go off to see a movie. Doug and I took Riku to a new playground in the Mission. It is lacking a sandbox but Riku thoroughly enjoyed climbing the stairs to the slide and exploring the "big kids" area for the longest time. </p>
<p>Back at home an hour later, I made Riku a big bowl of four grain cereal with berries and he ate every bite of it. He also had some drawing time, which gives him such great pleasure. He carefully takes the lids off the coloured markers, uses them, and then replaces the caps. Akane told me he did the same with pens at the pre-school she is hoping to get him into next year, and the teacher was so impressed. He tidied it all up when told they had to move on to another area. </p>
<p>Riku collected his tin of plastic animals and sat on the mat in the kitchen while I cleaned mushrooms and made a batch of Nanaimo bars. A few minutes later I noticed that he was lying on the rug with his face down... very unusual. Jokingly I asked him if he was a tired boy and he just turned his head to the other side. I went over, picked him up and asked if he wanted me to tuck him into bed. He just snuggled in and put his head on my arm in our usual going-to-sleep position. I was astounded; this was a first and it was then that I noticed how hot he was. He let me carry him into his room, turn on the sound machine (he always does this himself!), I took off everything but his diaper and tshirt as always, and sang to him. Less than two songs later he was sound asleep. It was 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Akane and Bryn came in 6:25 from their movie and Riku was standing on a chair playing in water in the kitchen sink. I pulled on a little pair of jogging pants but left his feet bare and just the tshirt on to keep him cool. No socks or slippers either and he happily played for a half hour with the water and some containers. </p>
<p>We all had dinner together; I had pasta on cooking when they arrived and put it together with some fresh basil and Buffalo mozzarella cheese from Susan. A salad and some English custard for dessert gave us a quick and easy meal. </p>
<p>Riku just wanted to snuggle and read "in other room" so off to the living room we went while everyone ate. I gently rubbed his tummy and back with my cool fingers; he was really hot and didn't mind my touching him a bit. After three books, we went back to join the others at the table so that Riku could eat a bowl of custard and some of his dad's as well, a good sign that he is a little hungry. He had nursed when his mom first came in too, so was a happy boy. </p>
<p>I hope whatever bug has caused our wee guy such a fever will be gone by tomorrow; he wasn't miserable with it, but did want to be comforted and quiet. Poor little fellow... I wonder how he is doing now, almost three hours later.</p>
