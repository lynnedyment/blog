								<h2>Amelia and Riku... Growing Up!</h2>
								<p>What a fun day I had with these two children! Kevin dropped Amelia off close to 9 a.m. today. She was a little reluctant to come in, cried a tiny bit, and cheered up immediately when I suggested that she come and paint. She happily waved goodbye to Kevin, and was her happy self for the rest of the morning. </p>
<p>I set her up with the painting materials immediately; she was dabbling away using one colour after another. At one point, when I was heating up her breakfast she dipped her entire hand into the purple paint tub! Luckily, it is not a real paint, but more like gel, so it rubs off instantly. Her painting is now hanging on the glass of the French doors next to Riku's which he did on Sunday. </p>
<p>While she was involved with the painting, Amelia looked over in my direction and said "see Mommy!" and then looked up and realized that of course I wasn't her mommy! I quietly said to her, with a little smile on my face "yes, Riku?". Amelia looked at me for about thirty seconds and got it! She turned to me and said "Hi Grandpa", I replied "Hi Uncle Bryn" to which she said "What doing Daddy?" and on it went. A half hour later she called me "Mommy" again, with that little smile letting me know she knew the game perfectly well. It was adorable and amazing too! </p>
<p>It was a busy hour for Amelia... playdo, bumblebee pushing, and being read to and flipping through a pop-up Christmas book she really liked. We read it four times plus two other books while she polished off her leftover eggs, "bacon" and toast for her breakfast. </p>
<p>As soon as she finished I asked her what time it was; her immediate response? "sleepy time." and it was indeed. She was tired when she arrived and Kevin thought she wouldn't last too long. At 10:05 I tucked her into bed, with Amelia climbing right up to the top of the bed to snuggle in, almost before I could get the bedding arranged for her. I walked out less than ten minutes later, after our three "regular" naptime songs and a little forehead stroking, called out ten minutes later, and was back to sleep in less than a minute. I even took a photo of her sleeping with Riku's golden dog, as she looked so sweet. </p>
<p>When I was putting Amelia's slippers on this morning, she burped. She patted her tummy, looked up at me with her big eyes, looked down and said "'melia burped; 'scuse me!" </p>
<p>About 55 minutes later she called out to me and once again was so proud that she "woke up all by myself!" Amelia told me she was hungry, so she ate a container of yogurt and most of her fruit tray while we she played with some split peas and a funnel, a new activity for the children this week. </p>
<p><br />
We sang some songs while she wandered about the house; "Hey daddy, there's a dragon in the driveway... " is a favourite right now, as is "10 green bottles on the wall... " as she loves it when they come crashing down. She puts her hands over her ears and grins away, saying "what's that?"  </p>
<p>I packed up a wee lunch/snack for Riku and we were on the road at 12:30. The newly opened highway gets me to Amelia's house in just fifteen minutes, arriving at 12:45. Susan was at the front of the apartment house waiting for us with a full bag of food goodies for me... two containers of inari, a container with four grape leaves, a wonderful looking entree tofu dish and a bag of tiny chocolate chip cookies! I couldn't resist eating one inari at a stop light on my way to pick up Riku... yum! Susan does spoil me, and yes, I love and appreciate it. </p>
<p>Riku came flying out when he saw me, with a huge grin and a big hug when he collided into me. He was happy to see "Nana's car!" and full of chatter about so many things... what he had seen on the way to school with his Daddy... big buildings, a big tower, a playground, some statues, a man drinking coffee, bamboo, a rainbow flag, and on and on he went! Bryn was quite amazed at how much he told me. </p>
<p>He ate a container of yogurt while we sat in front of the school, and then settled into his seat for his now routine "snack" for the drive home... a few broken ww breadsticks, two tiny ginger snaps, and some biscuits, today whole wheat "bunny" crackers. </p>
<p>This was the very first day that I didn't have to work at keeping him awake for the trip home. He used to be asleep within ten minutes or less of leaving the school, and I would sit in the car with him for one or two hours while he napped. Now I need the time at home and he needs to be stretched out more comfortably in bed too; I keep the windows partly opened, point out interesting things along the way, sing, etc. etc. but there are days those little eyes just can't take another minute of being opened. What a pleasure it was to get him here with me, have a few minutes to walk around and play, and then to tuck him into bed, ready for his nap. He slept for an hour and a half; perfect for him, I think, and he woke happy and ready to go to the beach with Amelia. We had talked about this on the way home. </p>
<p>However, Amelia and Susan had had a busy afternoon at the Exploratorium and Susan was certain that Amelia would be napping as soon as she got in the car. She was and that was fine with Riku, as he is always happy to just play around the house or in the yard.</p>
<p> First he ate a bowl of oatmeal and berries and then got busy making a "big hole" and fixing it with cardboard some books had come packed in, all of the various and sundry items from his big play basket in the kithen and the wooden puzzle box, which became his "tool box... be very careful, dangerous things in there!" It went on and on; heturned into a little carpenter overnight on me! He chatted away, telling me to help him fix the big hole, to be careful not to step too close, to not touch the ends of the tools, to help him with the "drilling, be careful, end very sharp and dangerous!" I couldn't quite believe my ears with all of this. Riku was very serious and hunched down piling things in the hole, moving "ladders over here", and refusing a snack at the table because he "busy working, not now!" I did make up a plate of strawberries and grapes and he insisted they go on the floor so he could eat them "when I not so busy"... which was immediately as he ate them so fast! That boy loves his strawberries and then wiped his hands thoroughly on the paper napkin I gave him. </p>
<p>I tried to talk him into going to the park so we could dig a hole there, but was told that "Riku dig hole in house" and that was that. I wanted him to get some fresh air though, and I certainly needed some, so I went out on my own to the garden to water and sweep. Riku couldn't resist helping with the big water jug and we spent the rest of the time outside sweeping and playing. Riku also stepped on peanuts to crack them for the blue jays, tried one and spit it out (they are a big soft so probably past their prime), and roared around with his big yellow caterpillar tractor, through the leaves and into the garden. It was chilly enough for his jacket, hat and scarf as the shade is heavy in the back by 6 p.m. </p>
<p>Bryn was here at 6:20 to take him home but we had a few minutes to catch up on Riku's day. Riku went down to "drive" the car for "two minutes" and I admired the pink and blue streaked sky that had disappeared by the time we waved goodbye. </p>
<p>I had two very sweet moments with the children today. Amelia is a very affectionate little girl and today I got so many big hugs and kisses on my cheeks while we were sitting at the table. She just leaned over and squeezed me over and over. </p>
<p>There must be something in the air as Riku for the very first time today, came over to where I was sitting "working" and "filling in the hole", gave me an impulsive kiss on the cheek and said very casually "I love you Nana" and walked off to continue building. I was very touched; he loves to hold hands and kisses hello and goodbye and often gives hugs too, or puts his hands on my cheeks (he sleeps like that with his mommy too), but this "I love you" was totally unexpected. Lucky me, to have these children in my life! </p>
<p>I ate a toasted tomato and "bacon" sandwich for dinner, read a couple of magazines, Skyped with Glenn and then Gail for a long time, wrote a couple of emails and didn't do a lick of work on my new big pile of paperwork. Oh well... it was a grand day!</p>
