								<h2>A Productive Monday</h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 6:30 this morning. I could have used another half hour of sleep, but Riku was wide awake, and I invited him to come and snuggle with me in my cosy "nest", just like wee Bryn and Caillie used to do. We sang some songs, looked at the big moon outside the window ("where are the stars?"), and read two books before getting up at 7 a.m.</p>
<p>The usual morning routine for a little person gettting ready for nursery school... another successful minute on the toilet and then he got dressed; it was a lovely sunny day out there already. I left him drawing while I took a quick shower and dressed before coming down to make his breakfast. He had some of his Grandpa's quite sour grapefruit juice, then strawberries (a favourite right now), half a banana, and a bowl of plain oatmeal. </p>
<p>We fed the blue jay who stopped by for peanuts, then washed Riku's face, brushed his hair, put his shoes on and went outside for a little walk up and down the street while waiting for his daddy to pick him up. It was a happy little boy who spotted the neighbour's cat across the way, so that we could "talk" to it and let him smell our hands. </p>
<p>Going down the steps to the sidewalk today, I neglected to start counting them, as I almost always do. At step number three Riku looked up and said "Let's count!" and so we did. </p>
<p>Bryn picked Riku up at 8:40 but first told me a story from yesterday about Riku making the letter "U" and identifying it as such, and then doing the same with the letter "I". He has been able to recognize letters for a long time now, but this was the first time he has drawn them. </p>
<p>Doug left just a few minutes later for his bus ride downtown to work. How strange after five years of having him home, to have him leaving each morning like this. </p>
<p>Before having breakfast myself, I called Caillie as she was home for lunch with her mommy on her own today. We had a lovely chat; she had a fun weekend at Oma and Opa's and the big news was that Uncle Mark let her drive the four wheel vehicle! She said he had told her it was much harder to drive than a regular car, and so she was very proud of herself. I told her I hadn't driven until I was thirty which made her even more proud. </p>
<p>Laundry day today after I treated myself to a "big" breakfast of egg, bacon and Acme sourdough bread, as well as my big mug of hot chocolate, served today in the mug that Caillie made for me two years ago. I sure love this quiet morning time reading the paper. </p>
<p>I identified a few more negatives, using the thread counter Doug pulled out for me, and finally got started at the vacuuming and cleaning, long neglected. I tried to call Zoe, in England, with no luck at all using our card; I had to make do with writing an email instead. </p>
<p>The minute I hung up the phone rang again. It was Geoff from the UK, calling to say he and Ruth are the great-grandparents, at the same tender age we are!, of a baby girl named Leila Rose. </p>
<p>The morning flew by, and it was soon time to prepare Riku's snack and head off at 12:40 to pick him up from nursery school. I thought he was going to stay awake again for the ride home, and the nap here, but after eating everything in his snack tray, he was fast asleep within five minutes of leaving the school. He had been sleeping for fifteen minutes when we arrived home, but I picked him up and carried him upstairs rather than sit in the car for an hour plus. It took almost a half hour to have him asleep again; we read a long story, sang a few songs, and I held him for a few minutes and he finally gave in. He slept for over two hours! </p>
<p>Meanwhile I read an interesting idea for a new "to-do" list... doing one job each of three different categories... "must do", "ought to" and "want to". It appealed to me so I instantly made my little list... iron ten shirts, do cards up through the month end, and read two magazines. I read the magazines first, as Riku was sleeping and it was a good time to sit with a hot cup of tea. I also "meditated" for twenty full minutes, which I keep intending to do. </p>
<p>After Riku woke, slowly as that was, we had a lovely quiet couple of hours together. He played with Play Do while I fed him a little pasta and then grapes; while playing he made "cookies" which we put on little plates and then I made a "cake" with candles, which he blew out after we sang Happy Birthday. Riku loves to pretend and really gets involved in it, holding up tiny "kittens" to cuddle and talk to, etc. </p>
<p>Today Riku told me he was in his "studio" "working" and had "many many many pens!" He drew away happily, making "rain" with long streaks of white on blue paper, and "lightning" with jagged edges. How he loves to draw and talk about what he is making. </p>
<p>Our time went by too quickly; just as he told me "I'm hungry, want some dinner!" Bryn and Akane came in to pick him up. Akane looked sweet with her hair in two ponytails, and sat down on the little stool in Riku's studio when he invited her in. At one point he put a flower lei on her head and one around her neck and then pronounced "you look like a Christmas tree!" We all laughed which made him laugh too. Akane gave him the yogurt and half slice of toast I had made for him, and after a little chatting they went home to prepare for a dinner with Brent, and Doug and I sat down to a bowl of barley vegetable soup for our dinner. </p>
<p>Upstairs for that ironing; the bonus was that I got through a whole Oprah tape. I treated myself to sitting and watching the last one, as the ten shirts were done! Came downstairs and got a card ready for John Gorst in England, and that finished up my commitments for today.<br />
Beth wrote to say she had as well! We're good.  </p>
<p>Extras: the SF General called to say that I am now protected against Hepatitis B for life; my tests came back positive. </p>
<p>Amelia had her second year check up today and had three shots, one of them for the flu. Poor wee girl. It's tough being little. </p>
<p>Kelly and Gregg have had a very productive few days and Kelly is feeling great about it... she's on a roll. </p>
<p>Riku singing "Teddy Bear's Picnic" today on his own... the few lines he has down pat, and it's just adorable. He loves to sing; I'm so glad!</p>
