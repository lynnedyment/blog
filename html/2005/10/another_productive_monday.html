								<h2>Another Productive Monday</h2>
								<p>Boring, and with no children in my house today, but productive for sure! I have been neglecting my blogs, but have made some notes so that I can catch up at some point soon; for now I will make today my first get-back-to-it entry. </p>
<p>Slept 'til 7:45 this morning; love the luxury of waking after a full night's sleep and knowing I don't have to rush into the shower immediately. Checked my emails, went downstairs for the paper, and then showered and changed the bedding. </p>
<p>Laundry day today and the goal was to get it, plus the ironing finally finished up, which I did. Also cleared the paperwork from my kitchen counter, and then decided to just keep going and get rid of the huge stack of paper in the big kitchen basket as well. </p>
<p>The most liberating thing I did today was decide that my current lifestyle is not going to allow me to try all the recipes I faithfully cut out of every magazine I read. So, out they go! I'm not even going to go through them, as they all appealed to me for some reason and I don't want to be tempted to change my mind. I have stacks of cookbooks, friends, and internet access, so out goes oh-so-much paper... and guilt along with it! </p>
<p>I made three appointments today, having decided that I am taking Mondays and Wednesdays to take care of all the things I have neglected to do for myself. This Wednesday I am taking part in a study at UCSF on Vitamin D, going from there to see the accupuncturist for the first time in perhaps six years, and then will carry on to the Kabuki for an hour massage and communal bath, courtesy of a birthday gift from Doug. Ahhh, can't wait. </p>
<p>So today was great; I got lots done, including sitting with a hot cup of tea and reading through two thick magazines, watched a large number of taped Oprah shows while doing two plus hours of ironing, and then came downstairs to toss, toss, toss those recipes, and continue with the filing of statements, etc. It was a great day! </p>
<p>Gail and I chatted for a bit on Skype tonight; we are heavily involved in more exciting discoveries from the UK family history. Actually Gail is doing the legwork online and I am cheering her on! </p>
<p>I chatted briefly with Susan and Kevin will drop Amelia for me tomorrow morning; she was trying to talk her parents into watching tv so didn't come to the phone to say hello tonight. She has a cold, like her mommy, and no doubt needs to just mellow out. </p>
<p>No call from Doug tonight; he planned to attend a Magic Meeting tonight in NYC and my guess is it was a late evening for him and he teaches in the morning. No goodnight call from Riku so I assume that Bryn went to play ping-pong with Brent.</p>
