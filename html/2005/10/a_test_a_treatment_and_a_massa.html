								<h2>A Test, a Treatment, and a Massage Day</h2>
								<p>Shall make this brief as there are no cute lines from children to write about. I had a wonderful day despite this and was surprised at how quickly it sped by. I had promised Gail I would toss out all the recipes I have clipped and collected over thirty years so the first thing I did today was to dump pounds of guilt into the recycling bin. I rescued only hand written recipes from Auntie Rita and Mom and shall share those with Gail and Candy for their albums. </p>
<p>At 11:30 I was at UCSF for the first of two meetings for a study on Vitamin D. The gal asked me some questions about my diet, and then explained how to fill out the form on which I shall note every bite of food and all the liquid I drink over a three day period... two week days and one weekend day. Blood was drawn, shall be tested for Vitamin D levels (the only way this can be done right now) and was out the door a half hour later. </p>
<p>After seven years away from my last acupuncture treatment, I was really looking forward to seeing Valerie, the gal whom I have seen many times in those previous years. She had helped me so much wtih an "achy" hip back then, and I was looking forward to the relief I knew I would find in both hips this time around. We chatted for about forty-minutes while she asked various questions about any problem spots I had, took my pulse, checked my tongue.. all the usual, and all asked in her very soft and gentle manner. I like her so much and trust her implicetly. I lay on the massage table on my tummy while she inserted about thirty needles, into my mid and lower back, calves, heel, feet and hands. Everything felt comfortable so she put on some soft and very quiet music, put a heater to blow on my feet and back and turned down the lights. I drifted into a restful sleep for about twenty-five minutes when she came in and spoke quietly to me. </p>
<p>Out came the needles, applied some wonderfully smelling concoction to my back, legs and arms, mixed up some herbs for me, and off I went, with just enough time to get to the Kabuki for my 3 p.m. hour long massage, a gift from Doug for my birthday. (I ate an apple on the way over. My big breakfast of egg, toast, "bacon" and hot chocolate seemed a long time ago.) </p>
<p>What a way this was to end my afternoon. Trish, the gal whom Susan discovered there, is a wonder massage therapist. She found all the tight spots on my upper back, along my spine and on my neck. It felt so amazingly good; I am determined to have a massage once a month for the rest of my life... or at least the rest of the year. I have just enough certificates to make it possible too! I was a warm puddle of warmth and relaxation when I finally convinced myself to move off that table in the warm dark room. I took my time soaking in the hot tub, the steam room and the sauna, forgoing the cold pool altogether. I didn't want to tighten up one muscle in my body. </p>
<p>I finally shampooed my hair, dressed and floated to the car. While waiting for a light on Potrero Avenue, I spotted Bryn in the car ahead of me. He managed to pull over beside me and suggested that I go over to their place as he was going to carve the pumpkin. I dashed home, quickly heat up a container of kunk pau tofu, sat at the table and ate it slowly (I was sooo hungry!) and then walked over to New Hampshire Street.</p>
<p>They were eating their dinner so I sat and helped Riku along with his while Bryn started in on the pumpkin. I took lots of photos of Riku's face when he saw what was inside it, while Bryn was carving and then of Riku making faces with pen on his own nursery school pumpkin. It was the most amazing thing to me to watch him hold that black pen so very carefully, draw two oval eyes in the right places, make a nose and then a long mouth, and then oh-so-carefully place a dot in the middle of each eye! I turned it around so he could do a second face.</p>
<p>He put a long eyebrow over the eyes this time and went back to put one on the first drawing. These fellows will absolutely need some brow plucking! The funniest thing of all to see though was his drawing a moustache over the mouth of one of them, all the while looking at Bryn's moustache... as though he were doing a portrait! Bryn says he will be down at Fisherman's Wharf in no time, bringing a little extra money into the house by doing portraits for tourists. </p>
<p>After this was finished there was just enough time to do a bit of the Ravensburger puzzle of Caillie's that I brought home for Riku. I really believed it would be much too hard for him, but he seems to have inherited his dad's and Caillie's talent at puzzles, as he was moving the pieces that I put down into the right places! I was really amazed at how quickly he has grasped the concept of this much more difficult kind of puzzle. </p>
<p>Riku wanted me to go to his room with him so we could "work at something". We moved trucks and cars around for a bit, pretending that there were "big accidents" and fire and policemen coming to help out. Riku is really wanting more and more one on one time with people now; he has always liked someone with him for some of the time, but this past week he insists that I join him in almost every car or truck or building activity. I guess now he feels he has enough drawing and looking at book time on his own and enjoys the company when his imagination is in high gear. </p>
<p>He was a tired fellow by 8 p.m. so I got him into his pajamas and left at 8:30. Lovely mild night outside; I enjoyed the walk home and instead of getting back to the paperwork as I intended to, just sat down to read through some magazines. It just seemed reasonable to end this relaxing day like this... I made my first and last cup of tea, read until I felt sleepy, answered a couple of emails, chatted with Gail on Skype for a while and went up to bed at 11 p.m. Feeling very relaxed here...</p>
