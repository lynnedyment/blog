								<h2>Tuesday Comes and Goes!</h2>
								<p>What a busy day today, and it flew by! Susan had a dentist appointment this morning, and so Kevin dropped Amelia off for me at 9 a.m., later than usual, but Amelia had fallen asleep in the car. It was obvious she wasn't going to be happy being put into bed immediately, so instead we had some play time and food before trying again at 10:20 a.m. This was very successful; Amelia went down for her nap without a whimper and slept for forty minutes, waking with her "Nana! Nana"... followed by "I wake up!". </p>
<p>We didn't have a lot of time together today, but packed lots into our few hours... in order: she ate a half bowl of her cereal, happily played in the living room while I cleaned it, pushed her bee after me as I vacuumed, and went upstairs on her own for quite a long time, playing with the plastics container. I crept up to see if all was well and there she sat, surrounded by big Lego blocks, plastic animals, etc. At one point I asked her if it was sleepy time yet. Her answer was a quick with no breath-in-between "no thank you please." </p>
<p>At 10 a.m. "I hungry"... ate all of her mushroom turnovers while I opened pistachios for her. Then she asked for BabyType by name, the online computer game that lets her listen to lots of sounds as she pushes the keys. Then she helped dust in the living room with the feather duster, dusting me as well! </p>
<p>"I'm hungry!" came right after her nap, so she ate an entire container of her yogurt while we looked at a book. Then she had time for a quick sweep of the garden with her little red broom, followed by "washing dishes?" in the sink. And then before we knew it, it was time to head home,singing "Old MacDonald", "BINGO", and "The Teddy Bear's Picnic" over and over and over. I dropped her off for her Mommy at 1 p.m. </p>
<p>Riku came bounding out of school but seemed to deflate the minute he was in the car seat. I gave him his little container of ww bread sticks, one fig bar, and two little ginger snaps. He ate them while I sang many songs to him. Those little eyes were falling fast at the halfway point home, and I so wanted him to nap in bed, and not sitting up in the car. I sang, and took his shoes off, pretending to be a big spider catching his toes, pointed out the huge rainbow flag as we passed through the Castro District, but at the hospital, three minutes from home, his eyes closed shut. </p>
<p>I managed the transition from car to bed very well today! Whew! He was asleep almost as soon as I put his head on the pillow; I had prepared the bed before leaving and was so glad I had taken off his shoes. I just slipped off his jeans, so he wouldn't be too hot, he murmured "Nana" and was out like a light. He napped for an hour and a half, but was obviously still tired. I could easily have gotten him back to sleep but thought it best if he were tired at his normal bedtime. </p>
<p>We had a lovely afternoon together. He also played with the Play Do; both children are enjoying it so much. Riku made cookies and we shared them while he ate a little mac and cheese with strawberries when he had had enough lunch. </p>
<p>I was hoping to go to the playground with him today, but he was just too dozy and the day wasn't terribly inviting with the gray fog and cool air. I opened up the back door and he went out to look for the blue jays and moved his trucks around for a while. </p>
<p>He decided he wanted every single one of his markets and pens today and sat working away busily at what he calls his "studio" now... his table in the kitchen. Riku likes experimenting with the "stampers" to see if he can also make lines with them. </p>
<p>I decided to give him a bath, as his head was sweaty during his nap, and he sat for the longest time splashing away in the water, playing with <strong>All</strong> of his toys. There was hardly room for him in the tub! </p>
<p>After dressing him and tidying up the bathroom we headed upstairs to read "many many books!" I love how Riku really looks at the pictures and asks what every little thing is that he hasn't noticed before... or else points them out. We "snuggle" sitting side by side; he is a snuggly boy and is very loving. </p>
<p>Earlier we had been in his room, where he pretended to be a doctor giving me a needle. He used a broken string of glittery beads (the other three were around my neck at his insistence), and rubbed it first to "clean" it, and then poked me with the little metal end, assuring me "it's okay" but looking a little worried about it. I got a bandaid out for him, which he carefully peeled the backing off and stuck it on my "hurt". </p>
<p>Coming downstairs, in anticipation of his dad's arrival, Riku asked me to help him. He said "I have a BIG surprise for you!" and when I asked what it was he told me it was my birthday, and he had "a present, many many presents", and a cake! It was really adorable; we sat at the table, while he sang "Happy Birthday" to me perfectly... I must get this on tape!.. and then watched as I exclaimed over the present, and enjoyed my Play Do chocolate cake, and "tea with milk?... okay." </p>
<p>He was busy drawing again when Bryn arrived and he sat with Riku for "just five minutes". They left happily around 6:30, Doug arrived home at 7:30 after his Tai Chi class, and the evening was over before we knew it. I worked on getting hundreds of printed Ofoto pics in order, loving every minute of it, and trying to ignore the fact that I didn't do the ironing I had promised myself I would do yesterday. Oh well. </p>
<p>Bedtime at 12:15.</p>
