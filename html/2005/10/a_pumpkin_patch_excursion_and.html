								<h2>A Pumpkin Patch Excursion and a Sleepover!</h2>
								<p>Bryn and Riku picked me up at 9:30 this morning for a trip to Half Moon Bay and a couple of pumpkin patches. Susan and I had taken the children out last year, and the plan was to meet them there, after the children had napped in the cars. Riku's lasted only a half hour, and even though it was obvious that he was still sleepy, he was ready to get out and see the pumpkins. It was already much warmer on the coast, and we were happy to sit in a shady spot, with Riku keeping busy covering up a little pumkin with straw. By the time that Susan and Amelia had joined us, the pumpkin had disappeared. </p>
<p>Amelia went on a pony ride; she was too small for this last year but she loved it as much as we thought she would. She would turn and wave to her mom and me as she rode by, as nonchalantly as you could please. </p>
<p>Riku was interested in watching the other children ride, but said he didn't want to go on himself. He's a little nervous around animals, although likes them, and Amelia cries when she has to leave them. </p>
<p>Susan and I took the children on the train ride, which Riku remembered from last year. He found the "scary" ghost and skeleton figures along the tracks "funny" while Amelia decided she would close her eyes to most of them. They are quite gruesome and she just did not like them. Interesting to see what these two children handle best; they are very different in this way. </p>
<p>At one point we stopped to look at another pumpkin exhibit and Riku started picking up straw and tossing it about, over and around him. He loved this; meanwhile, Amelia had perched herself very prettily on a small pumpkin and ended up having bits of straw land on her too. We laughed as she sat there with her arms folded, looking resigned to her fate, until at last she stood up and joined in. It ended with me covered from head to foot with straw, Riku laughing out loud every time he threw it at me. </p>
<p>We walked across the very busy road, now packed with families coming to the patches later in the day. Susan and Bryn took the children up a very tall plastic bouncing slide, and had the children in front of them whilst sliding down. They all loved it! </p>
<p>Riku found himself another patch of shade with his dad and Amelia went off for another ride, this time on a horse, or at least a much taller pony, to my inexperienced eyes! She looked ever so professional, sitting so nice and tall, with her hands perfectly gripped on the horn of the saddle. Every once in a while she would lean over and pat the horse. </p>
<p>Back to our cars, although Susan dashed off to look at a photo that had been taken at the second horse ride, and while she was gone I had our car door open for the breeze coming in. It was very hot by now! A pony, grazing in a field beside the fence, stuck his entire head inside the car door, much to Riku's delight! I think he could smell the cheese on my hands and was curious; he also took hold of the seat belt strap and tugged at it. Riku just loved it and so did the passersby! Bryn and Amelia had a good look at this too, as they were parked behind us. What fun for Riku... up close and personal as it was! What big teeth he had! ... the horse, not Riku. </p>
<p>I fed Riku some solid food in the car on our way to a Hawaiian restaurant for lunch. He was happy to nibble on some snacks and draw while we ate a small lunch, and five minutes after getting in the car he was fast asleep. Susan and Bryn both stopped at a roadside field to pick up some pumpkins. I read in the car with my feet up and quite enjoyed the breeze. </p>
<p>Home at 4 p.m. after an hour nap for Riku in the car. Bryn dropped me off for some quiet time at home; Doug was at work, and I made some tea, and continued on with the photo sorting work I am keeping busy with. Wish I had days instead of an hour or two, but I am getting through them, slowly but surely. </p>
<p>At 6:30 Akane and Bryn dropped Riku off for me, with his pj's and clothes for school tomorrow. This is his second sleepover with us, and I am very excited at having him here in the morning when I waken. He ate a big bowl of macaroni and cheese, with carrots and spinach added to it, then had some raspberry sorbet and lots of water. He did some drawing, asking me to make him a big scary face, as he has been quite fascinted with one he has seen at Akane's studio the past two days. </p>
<p>A new saying tonight... "I know.... !" followed by a suggestion as to what we can do next. "I know!... maybe we could read the teddy bear picnic book!" He said it several times this evening and it was adorable. How his vocabulary is changing and growing. I know it's to be expected, but it's hard to even write things down now, as they just sound so very ordinary and grown up. I'm amazed at the time, but then he's on to something else just as extraordinary/ordinary! </p>
<p>In quick succession... a short tub with a new frog, as he sat on the toilet and was successful at urinating. This has been put on the back burner lately, and I haven't had any luck having him go this past two weeks. So, we're back on track over here... </p>
<p>At 8:15 he was tucked into bed, after "maybe two stories?" and a couple of songs. I slept downstairs in the front bedroom, so I would hear him in the night, although he woke at 10:30 and 11 p.m. when I still upstairs with Doug watching tv. </p>
<p>During the night he awoke twice, at 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., each time for just the minute it took to tuck him back into bed. This new nighttime routine is going well indeed. </p>
<p>Susan was so efficient and had already downloaded her photos from today and sent them on to me. Doug kindly took the time tonight, to go through a huge number of photos I had taken this week, although we have a lot more to do. This is the first time we have been so behind, but I guess working full time during the day takes away from the photo work! He arrived home after 8:30 tonight, having had dinner with Dave before coming home. </p>
<p>Me? I was tucked in at 11:30 and managed to read a whole page before drifting off!</p>
