								<h2><a href="/2005/10/a_pumpkin_patch_excursion_and.html">A Pumpkin Patch Excursion and a Sleepover!</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn and Riku picked me up at 9:30 this morning for a trip to Half Moon Bay and a couple of pumpkin patches. Susan and I had taken the children out last year, and the plan was to meet them there, after the children had napped in the cars. Riku's lasted only a half hour, and even though it was obvious that he was still sleepy, he was ready to get out and see the pumpkins. It was already much warmer on the coast, and we were happy to sit in a shady spot, with Riku keeping busy covering up a little pumkin with straw. By the time that Susan and Amelia had joined us, the pumpkin had disappeared. </p>
<p>Amelia went on a pony ride; she was too small for this last year but she loved it as much as we thought she would. She would turn and wave to her mom and me as she rode by, as nonchalantly as you could please. </p>
<p>Riku was interested in watching the other children ride, but said he didn't want to go on himself. He's a little nervous around animals, although likes them, and Amelia cries when she has to leave them. </p>
<p>Susan and I took the children on the train ride, which Riku remembered from last year. He found the "scary" ghost and skeleton figures along the tracks "funny" while Amelia decided she would close her eyes to most of them. They are quite gruesome and she just did not like them. Interesting to see what these two children handle best; they are very different in this way. </p>
<p>At one point we stopped to look at another pumpkin exhibit and Riku started picking up straw and tossing it about, over and around him. He loved this; meanwhile, Amelia had perched herself very prettily on a small pumpkin and ended up having bits of straw land on her too. We laughed as she sat there with her arms folded, looking resigned to her fate, until at last she stood up and joined in. It ended with me covered from head to foot with straw, Riku laughing out loud every time he threw it at me. </p>
<p>We walked across the very busy road, now packed with families coming to the patches later in the day. Susan and Bryn took the children up a very tall plastic bouncing slide, and had the children in front of them whilst sliding down. They all loved it! </p>
<p>Riku found himself another patch of shade with his dad and Amelia went off for another ride, this time on a horse, or at least a much taller pony, to my inexperienced eyes! She looked ever so professional, sitting so nice and tall, with her hands perfectly gripped on the horn of the saddle. Every once in a while she would lean over and pat the horse. </p>
<p>Back to our cars, although Susan dashed off to look at a photo that had been taken at the second horse ride, and while she was gone I had our car door open for the breeze coming in. It was very hot by now! A pony, grazing in a field beside the fence, stuck his entire head inside the car door, much to Riku's delight! I think he could smell the cheese on my hands and was curious; he also took hold of the seat belt strap and tugged at it. Riku just loved it and so did the passersby! Bryn and Amelia had a good look at this too, as they were parked behind us. What fun for Riku... up close and personal as it was! What big teeth he had! ... the horse, not Riku. </p>
<p>I fed Riku some solid food in the car on our way to a Hawaiian restaurant for lunch. He was happy to nibble on some snacks and draw while we ate a small lunch, and five minutes after getting in the car he was fast asleep. Susan and Bryn both stopped at a roadside field to pick up some pumpkins. I read in the car with my feet up and quite enjoyed the breeze. </p>
<p>Home at 4 p.m. after an hour nap for Riku in the car. Bryn dropped me off for some quiet time at home; Doug was at work, and I made some tea, and continued on with the photo sorting work I am keeping busy with. Wish I had days instead of an hour or two, but I am getting through them, slowly but surely. </p>
<p>At 6:30 Akane and Bryn dropped Riku off for me, with his pj's and clothes for school tomorrow. This is his second sleepover with us, and I am very excited at having him here in the morning when I waken. He ate a big bowl of macaroni and cheese, with carrots and spinach added to it, then had some raspberry sorbet and lots of water. He did some drawing, asking me to make him a big scary face, as he has been quite fascinted with one he has seen at Akane's studio the past two days. </p>
<p>A new saying tonight... "I know.... !" followed by a suggestion as to what we can do next. "I know!... maybe we could read the teddy bear picnic book!" He said it several times this evening and it was adorable. How his vocabulary is changing and growing. I know it's to be expected, but it's hard to even write things down now, as they just sound so very ordinary and grown up. I'm amazed at the time, but then he's on to something else just as extraordinary/ordinary! </p>
<p>In quick succession... a short tub with a new frog, as he sat on the toilet and was successful at urinating. This has been put on the back burner lately, and I haven't had any luck having him go this past two weeks. So, we're back on track over here... </p>
<p>At 8:15 he was tucked into bed, after "maybe two stories?" and a couple of songs. I slept downstairs in the front bedroom, so I would hear him in the night, although he woke at 10:30 and 11 p.m. when I still upstairs with Doug watching tv. </p>
<p>During the night he awoke twice, at 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., each time for just the minute it took to tuck him back into bed. This new nighttime routine is going well indeed. </p>
<p>Susan was so efficient and had already downloaded her photos from today and sent them on to me. Doug kindly took the time tonight, to go through a huge number of photos I had taken this week, although we have a lot more to do. This is the first time we have been so behind, but I guess working full time during the day takes away from the photo work! He arrived home after 8:30 tonight, having had dinner with Dave before coming home. </p>
<p>Me? I was tucked in at 11:30 and managed to read a whole page before drifting off!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/10/a_productive_monday.html">A Productive Monday</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 6:30 this morning. I could have used another half hour of sleep, but Riku was wide awake, and I invited him to come and snuggle with me in my cosy "nest", just like wee Bryn and Caillie used to do. We sang some songs, looked at the big moon outside the window ("where are the stars?"), and read two books before getting up at 7 a.m.</p>
<p>The usual morning routine for a little person gettting ready for nursery school... another successful minute on the toilet and then he got dressed; it was a lovely sunny day out there already. I left him drawing while I took a quick shower and dressed before coming down to make his breakfast. He had some of his Grandpa's quite sour grapefruit juice, then strawberries (a favourite right now), half a banana, and a bowl of plain oatmeal. </p>
<p>We fed the blue jay who stopped by for peanuts, then washed Riku's face, brushed his hair, put his shoes on and went outside for a little walk up and down the street while waiting for his daddy to pick him up. It was a happy little boy who spotted the neighbour's cat across the way, so that we could "talk" to it and let him smell our hands. </p>
<p>Going down the steps to the sidewalk today, I neglected to start counting them, as I almost always do. At step number three Riku looked up and said "Let's count!" and so we did. </p>
<p>Bryn picked Riku up at 8:40 but first told me a story from yesterday about Riku making the letter "U" and identifying it as such, and then doing the same with the letter "I". He has been able to recognize letters for a long time now, but this was the first time he has drawn them. </p>
<p>Doug left just a few minutes later for his bus ride downtown to work. How strange after five years of having him home, to have him leaving each morning like this. </p>
<p>Before having breakfast myself, I called Caillie as she was home for lunch with her mommy on her own today. We had a lovely chat; she had a fun weekend at Oma and Opa's and the big news was that Uncle Mark let her drive the four wheel vehicle! She said he had told her it was much harder to drive than a regular car, and so she was very proud of herself. I told her I hadn't driven until I was thirty which made her even more proud. </p>
<p>Laundry day today after I treated myself to a "big" breakfast of egg, bacon and Acme sourdough bread, as well as my big mug of hot chocolate, served today in the mug that Caillie made for me two years ago. I sure love this quiet morning time reading the paper. </p>
<p>I identified a few more negatives, using the thread counter Doug pulled out for me, and finally got started at the vacuuming and cleaning, long neglected. I tried to call Zoe, in England, with no luck at all using our card; I had to make do with writing an email instead. </p>
<p>The minute I hung up the phone rang again. It was Geoff from the UK, calling to say he and Ruth are the great-grandparents, at the same tender age we are!, of a baby girl named Leila Rose. </p>
<p>The morning flew by, and it was soon time to prepare Riku's snack and head off at 12:40 to pick him up from nursery school. I thought he was going to stay awake again for the ride home, and the nap here, but after eating everything in his snack tray, he was fast asleep within five minutes of leaving the school. He had been sleeping for fifteen minutes when we arrived home, but I picked him up and carried him upstairs rather than sit in the car for an hour plus. It took almost a half hour to have him asleep again; we read a long story, sang a few songs, and I held him for a few minutes and he finally gave in. He slept for over two hours! </p>
<p>Meanwhile I read an interesting idea for a new "to-do" list... doing one job each of three different categories... "must do", "ought to" and "want to". It appealed to me so I instantly made my little list... iron ten shirts, do cards up through the month end, and read two magazines. I read the magazines first, as Riku was sleeping and it was a good time to sit with a hot cup of tea. I also "meditated" for twenty full minutes, which I keep intending to do. </p>
<p>After Riku woke, slowly as that was, we had a lovely quiet couple of hours together. He played with Play Do while I fed him a little pasta and then grapes; while playing he made "cookies" which we put on little plates and then I made a "cake" with candles, which he blew out after we sang Happy Birthday. Riku loves to pretend and really gets involved in it, holding up tiny "kittens" to cuddle and talk to, etc. </p>
<p>Today Riku told me he was in his "studio" "working" and had "many many many pens!" He drew away happily, making "rain" with long streaks of white on blue paper, and "lightning" with jagged edges. How he loves to draw and talk about what he is making. </p>
<p>Our time went by too quickly; just as he told me "I'm hungry, want some dinner!" Bryn and Akane came in to pick him up. Akane looked sweet with her hair in two ponytails, and sat down on the little stool in Riku's studio when he invited her in. At one point he put a flower lei on her head and one around her neck and then pronounced "you look like a Christmas tree!" We all laughed which made him laugh too. Akane gave him the yogurt and half slice of toast I had made for him, and after a little chatting they went home to prepare for a dinner with Brent, and Doug and I sat down to a bowl of barley vegetable soup for our dinner. </p>
<p>Upstairs for that ironing; the bonus was that I got through a whole Oprah tape. I treated myself to sitting and watching the last one, as the ten shirts were done! Came downstairs and got a card ready for John Gorst in England, and that finished up my commitments for today.<br />
Beth wrote to say she had as well! We're good.  </p>
<p>Extras: the SF General called to say that I am now protected against Hepatitis B for life; my tests came back positive. </p>
<p>Amelia had her second year check up today and had three shots, one of them for the flu. Poor wee girl. It's tough being little. </p>
<p>Kelly and Gregg have had a very productive few days and Kelly is feeling great about it... she's on a roll. </p>
<p>Riku singing "Teddy Bear's Picnic" today on his own... the few lines he has down pat, and it's just adorable. He loves to sing; I'm so glad!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/10/tuesday_comes_and_goes.html">Tuesday Comes and Goes!</a></h2>
								<p>What a busy day today, and it flew by! Susan had a dentist appointment this morning, and so Kevin dropped Amelia off for me at 9 a.m., later than usual, but Amelia had fallen asleep in the car. It was obvious she wasn't going to be happy being put into bed immediately, so instead we had some play time and food before trying again at 10:20 a.m. This was very successful; Amelia went down for her nap without a whimper and slept for forty minutes, waking with her "Nana! Nana"... followed by "I wake up!". </p>
<p>We didn't have a lot of time together today, but packed lots into our few hours... in order: she ate a half bowl of her cereal, happily played in the living room while I cleaned it, pushed her bee after me as I vacuumed, and went upstairs on her own for quite a long time, playing with the plastics container. I crept up to see if all was well and there she sat, surrounded by big Lego blocks, plastic animals, etc. At one point I asked her if it was sleepy time yet. Her answer was a quick with no breath-in-between "no thank you please." </p>
<p>At 10 a.m. "I hungry"... ate all of her mushroom turnovers while I opened pistachios for her. Then she asked for BabyType by name, the online computer game that lets her listen to lots of sounds as she pushes the keys. Then she helped dust in the living room with the feather duster, dusting me as well! </p>
<p>"I'm hungry!" came right after her nap, so she ate an entire container of her yogurt while we looked at a book. Then she had time for a quick sweep of the garden with her little red broom, followed by "washing dishes?" in the sink. And then before we knew it, it was time to head home,singing "Old MacDonald", "BINGO", and "The Teddy Bear's Picnic" over and over and over. I dropped her off for her Mommy at 1 p.m. </p>
<p>Riku came bounding out of school but seemed to deflate the minute he was in the car seat. I gave him his little container of ww bread sticks, one fig bar, and two little ginger snaps. He ate them while I sang many songs to him. Those little eyes were falling fast at the halfway point home, and I so wanted him to nap in bed, and not sitting up in the car. I sang, and took his shoes off, pretending to be a big spider catching his toes, pointed out the huge rainbow flag as we passed through the Castro District, but at the hospital, three minutes from home, his eyes closed shut. </p>
<p>I managed the transition from car to bed very well today! Whew! He was asleep almost as soon as I put his head on the pillow; I had prepared the bed before leaving and was so glad I had taken off his shoes. I just slipped off his jeans, so he wouldn't be too hot, he murmured "Nana" and was out like a light. He napped for an hour and a half, but was obviously still tired. I could easily have gotten him back to sleep but thought it best if he were tired at his normal bedtime. </p>
<p>We had a lovely afternoon together. He also played with the Play Do; both children are enjoying it so much. Riku made cookies and we shared them while he ate a little mac and cheese with strawberries when he had had enough lunch. </p>
<p>I was hoping to go to the playground with him today, but he was just too dozy and the day wasn't terribly inviting with the gray fog and cool air. I opened up the back door and he went out to look for the blue jays and moved his trucks around for a while. </p>
<p>He decided he wanted every single one of his markets and pens today and sat working away busily at what he calls his "studio" now... his table in the kitchen. Riku likes experimenting with the "stampers" to see if he can also make lines with them. </p>
<p>I decided to give him a bath, as his head was sweaty during his nap, and he sat for the longest time splashing away in the water, playing with <strong>All</strong> of his toys. There was hardly room for him in the tub! </p>
<p>After dressing him and tidying up the bathroom we headed upstairs to read "many many books!" I love how Riku really looks at the pictures and asks what every little thing is that he hasn't noticed before... or else points them out. We "snuggle" sitting side by side; he is a snuggly boy and is very loving. </p>
<p>Earlier we had been in his room, where he pretended to be a doctor giving me a needle. He used a broken string of glittery beads (the other three were around my neck at his insistence), and rubbed it first to "clean" it, and then poked me with the little metal end, assuring me "it's okay" but looking a little worried about it. I got a bandaid out for him, which he carefully peeled the backing off and stuck it on my "hurt". </p>
<p>Coming downstairs, in anticipation of his dad's arrival, Riku asked me to help him. He said "I have a BIG surprise for you!" and when I asked what it was he told me it was my birthday, and he had "a present, many many presents", and a cake! It was really adorable; we sat at the table, while he sang "Happy Birthday" to me perfectly... I must get this on tape!.. and then watched as I exclaimed over the present, and enjoyed my Play Do chocolate cake, and "tea with milk?... okay." </p>
<p>He was busy drawing again when Bryn arrived and he sat with Riku for "just five minutes". They left happily around 6:30, Doug arrived home at 7:30 after his Tai Chi class, and the evening was over before we knew it. I worked on getting hundreds of printed Ofoto pics in order, loving every minute of it, and trying to ignore the fact that I didn't do the ironing I had promised myself I would do yesterday. Oh well. </p>
<p>Bedtime at 12:15.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/10/another_productive_monday.html">Another Productive Monday</a></h2>
								<p>Boring, and with no children in my house today, but productive for sure! I have been neglecting my blogs, but have made some notes so that I can catch up at some point soon; for now I will make today my first get-back-to-it entry. </p>
<p>Slept 'til 7:45 this morning; love the luxury of waking after a full night's sleep and knowing I don't have to rush into the shower immediately. Checked my emails, went downstairs for the paper, and then showered and changed the bedding. </p>
<p>Laundry day today and the goal was to get it, plus the ironing finally finished up, which I did. Also cleared the paperwork from my kitchen counter, and then decided to just keep going and get rid of the huge stack of paper in the big kitchen basket as well. </p>
<p>The most liberating thing I did today was decide that my current lifestyle is not going to allow me to try all the recipes I faithfully cut out of every magazine I read. So, out they go! I'm not even going to go through them, as they all appealed to me for some reason and I don't want to be tempted to change my mind. I have stacks of cookbooks, friends, and internet access, so out goes oh-so-much paper... and guilt along with it! </p>
<p>I made three appointments today, having decided that I am taking Mondays and Wednesdays to take care of all the things I have neglected to do for myself. This Wednesday I am taking part in a study at UCSF on Vitamin D, going from there to see the accupuncturist for the first time in perhaps six years, and then will carry on to the Kabuki for an hour massage and communal bath, courtesy of a birthday gift from Doug. Ahhh, can't wait. </p>
<p>So today was great; I got lots done, including sitting with a hot cup of tea and reading through two thick magazines, watched a large number of taped Oprah shows while doing two plus hours of ironing, and then came downstairs to toss, toss, toss those recipes, and continue with the filing of statements, etc. It was a great day! </p>
<p>Gail and I chatted for a bit on Skype tonight; we are heavily involved in more exciting discoveries from the UK family history. Actually Gail is doing the legwork online and I am cheering her on! </p>
<p>I chatted briefly with Susan and Kevin will drop Amelia for me tomorrow morning; she was trying to talk her parents into watching tv so didn't come to the phone to say hello tonight. She has a cold, like her mommy, and no doubt needs to just mellow out. </p>
<p>No call from Doug tonight; he planned to attend a Magic Meeting tonight in NYC and my guess is it was a late evening for him and he teaches in the morning. No goodnight call from Riku so I assume that Bryn went to play ping-pong with Brent.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/10/amelia_and_riku_growing_up.html">Amelia and Riku... Growing Up!</a></h2>
								<p>What a fun day I had with these two children! Kevin dropped Amelia off close to 9 a.m. today. She was a little reluctant to come in, cried a tiny bit, and cheered up immediately when I suggested that she come and paint. She happily waved goodbye to Kevin, and was her happy self for the rest of the morning. </p>
<p>I set her up with the painting materials immediately; she was dabbling away using one colour after another. At one point, when I was heating up her breakfast she dipped her entire hand into the purple paint tub! Luckily, it is not a real paint, but more like gel, so it rubs off instantly. Her painting is now hanging on the glass of the French doors next to Riku's which he did on Sunday. </p>
<p>While she was involved with the painting, Amelia looked over in my direction and said "see Mommy!" and then looked up and realized that of course I wasn't her mommy! I quietly said to her, with a little smile on my face "yes, Riku?". Amelia looked at me for about thirty seconds and got it! She turned to me and said "Hi Grandpa", I replied "Hi Uncle Bryn" to which she said "What doing Daddy?" and on it went. A half hour later she called me "Mommy" again, with that little smile letting me know she knew the game perfectly well. It was adorable and amazing too! </p>
<p>It was a busy hour for Amelia... playdo, bumblebee pushing, and being read to and flipping through a pop-up Christmas book she really liked. We read it four times plus two other books while she polished off her leftover eggs, "bacon" and toast for her breakfast. </p>
<p>As soon as she finished I asked her what time it was; her immediate response? "sleepy time." and it was indeed. She was tired when she arrived and Kevin thought she wouldn't last too long. At 10:05 I tucked her into bed, with Amelia climbing right up to the top of the bed to snuggle in, almost before I could get the bedding arranged for her. I walked out less than ten minutes later, after our three "regular" naptime songs and a little forehead stroking, called out ten minutes later, and was back to sleep in less than a minute. I even took a photo of her sleeping with Riku's golden dog, as she looked so sweet. </p>
<p>When I was putting Amelia's slippers on this morning, she burped. She patted her tummy, looked up at me with her big eyes, looked down and said "'melia burped; 'scuse me!" </p>
<p>About 55 minutes later she called out to me and once again was so proud that she "woke up all by myself!" Amelia told me she was hungry, so she ate a container of yogurt and most of her fruit tray while we she played with some split peas and a funnel, a new activity for the children this week. </p>
<p><br />
We sang some songs while she wandered about the house; "Hey daddy, there's a dragon in the driveway... " is a favourite right now, as is "10 green bottles on the wall... " as she loves it when they come crashing down. She puts her hands over her ears and grins away, saying "what's that?"  </p>
<p>I packed up a wee lunch/snack for Riku and we were on the road at 12:30. The newly opened highway gets me to Amelia's house in just fifteen minutes, arriving at 12:45. Susan was at the front of the apartment house waiting for us with a full bag of food goodies for me... two containers of inari, a container with four grape leaves, a wonderful looking entree tofu dish and a bag of tiny chocolate chip cookies! I couldn't resist eating one inari at a stop light on my way to pick up Riku... yum! Susan does spoil me, and yes, I love and appreciate it. </p>
<p>Riku came flying out when he saw me, with a huge grin and a big hug when he collided into me. He was happy to see "Nana's car!" and full of chatter about so many things... what he had seen on the way to school with his Daddy... big buildings, a big tower, a playground, some statues, a man drinking coffee, bamboo, a rainbow flag, and on and on he went! Bryn was quite amazed at how much he told me. </p>
<p>He ate a container of yogurt while we sat in front of the school, and then settled into his seat for his now routine "snack" for the drive home... a few broken ww breadsticks, two tiny ginger snaps, and some biscuits, today whole wheat "bunny" crackers. </p>
<p>This was the very first day that I didn't have to work at keeping him awake for the trip home. He used to be asleep within ten minutes or less of leaving the school, and I would sit in the car with him for one or two hours while he napped. Now I need the time at home and he needs to be stretched out more comfortably in bed too; I keep the windows partly opened, point out interesting things along the way, sing, etc. etc. but there are days those little eyes just can't take another minute of being opened. What a pleasure it was to get him here with me, have a few minutes to walk around and play, and then to tuck him into bed, ready for his nap. He slept for an hour and a half; perfect for him, I think, and he woke happy and ready to go to the beach with Amelia. We had talked about this on the way home. </p>
<p>However, Amelia and Susan had had a busy afternoon at the Exploratorium and Susan was certain that Amelia would be napping as soon as she got in the car. She was and that was fine with Riku, as he is always happy to just play around the house or in the yard.</p>
<p> First he ate a bowl of oatmeal and berries and then got busy making a "big hole" and fixing it with cardboard some books had come packed in, all of the various and sundry items from his big play basket in the kithen and the wooden puzzle box, which became his "tool box... be very careful, dangerous things in there!" It went on and on; heturned into a little carpenter overnight on me! He chatted away, telling me to help him fix the big hole, to be careful not to step too close, to not touch the ends of the tools, to help him with the "drilling, be careful, end very sharp and dangerous!" I couldn't quite believe my ears with all of this. Riku was very serious and hunched down piling things in the hole, moving "ladders over here", and refusing a snack at the table because he "busy working, not now!" I did make up a plate of strawberries and grapes and he insisted they go on the floor so he could eat them "when I not so busy"... which was immediately as he ate them so fast! That boy loves his strawberries and then wiped his hands thoroughly on the paper napkin I gave him. </p>
<p>I tried to talk him into going to the park so we could dig a hole there, but was told that "Riku dig hole in house" and that was that. I wanted him to get some fresh air though, and I certainly needed some, so I went out on my own to the garden to water and sweep. Riku couldn't resist helping with the big water jug and we spent the rest of the time outside sweeping and playing. Riku also stepped on peanuts to crack them for the blue jays, tried one and spit it out (they are a big soft so probably past their prime), and roared around with his big yellow caterpillar tractor, through the leaves and into the garden. It was chilly enough for his jacket, hat and scarf as the shade is heavy in the back by 6 p.m. </p>
<p>Bryn was here at 6:20 to take him home but we had a few minutes to catch up on Riku's day. Riku went down to "drive" the car for "two minutes" and I admired the pink and blue streaked sky that had disappeared by the time we waved goodbye. </p>
<p>I had two very sweet moments with the children today. Amelia is a very affectionate little girl and today I got so many big hugs and kisses on my cheeks while we were sitting at the table. She just leaned over and squeezed me over and over. </p>
<p>There must be something in the air as Riku for the very first time today, came over to where I was sitting "working" and "filling in the hole", gave me an impulsive kiss on the cheek and said very casually "I love you Nana" and walked off to continue building. I was very touched; he loves to hold hands and kisses hello and goodbye and often gives hugs too, or puts his hands on my cheeks (he sleeps like that with his mommy too), but this "I love you" was totally unexpected. Lucky me, to have these children in my life! </p>
<p>I ate a toasted tomato and "bacon" sandwich for dinner, read a couple of magazines, Skyped with Glenn and then Gail for a long time, wrote a couple of emails and didn't do a lick of work on my new big pile of paperwork. Oh well... it was a grand day!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/10/a_test_a_treatment_and_a_massa.html">A Test, a Treatment, and a Massage Day</a></h2>
								<p>Shall make this brief as there are no cute lines from children to write about. I had a wonderful day despite this and was surprised at how quickly it sped by. I had promised Gail I would toss out all the recipes I have clipped and collected over thirty years so the first thing I did today was to dump pounds of guilt into the recycling bin. I rescued only hand written recipes from Auntie Rita and Mom and shall share those with Gail and Candy for their albums. </p>
<p>At 11:30 I was at UCSF for the first of two meetings for a study on Vitamin D. The gal asked me some questions about my diet, and then explained how to fill out the form on which I shall note every bite of food and all the liquid I drink over a three day period... two week days and one weekend day. Blood was drawn, shall be tested for Vitamin D levels (the only way this can be done right now) and was out the door a half hour later. </p>
<p>After seven years away from my last acupuncture treatment, I was really looking forward to seeing Valerie, the gal whom I have seen many times in those previous years. She had helped me so much wtih an "achy" hip back then, and I was looking forward to the relief I knew I would find in both hips this time around. We chatted for about forty-minutes while she asked various questions about any problem spots I had, took my pulse, checked my tongue.. all the usual, and all asked in her very soft and gentle manner. I like her so much and trust her implicetly. I lay on the massage table on my tummy while she inserted about thirty needles, into my mid and lower back, calves, heel, feet and hands. Everything felt comfortable so she put on some soft and very quiet music, put a heater to blow on my feet and back and turned down the lights. I drifted into a restful sleep for about twenty-five minutes when she came in and spoke quietly to me. </p>
<p>Out came the needles, applied some wonderfully smelling concoction to my back, legs and arms, mixed up some herbs for me, and off I went, with just enough time to get to the Kabuki for my 3 p.m. hour long massage, a gift from Doug for my birthday. (I ate an apple on the way over. My big breakfast of egg, toast, "bacon" and hot chocolate seemed a long time ago.) </p>
<p>What a way this was to end my afternoon. Trish, the gal whom Susan discovered there, is a wonder massage therapist. She found all the tight spots on my upper back, along my spine and on my neck. It felt so amazingly good; I am determined to have a massage once a month for the rest of my life... or at least the rest of the year. I have just enough certificates to make it possible too! I was a warm puddle of warmth and relaxation when I finally convinced myself to move off that table in the warm dark room. I took my time soaking in the hot tub, the steam room and the sauna, forgoing the cold pool altogether. I didn't want to tighten up one muscle in my body. </p>
<p>I finally shampooed my hair, dressed and floated to the car. While waiting for a light on Potrero Avenue, I spotted Bryn in the car ahead of me. He managed to pull over beside me and suggested that I go over to their place as he was going to carve the pumpkin. I dashed home, quickly heat up a container of kunk pau tofu, sat at the table and ate it slowly (I was sooo hungry!) and then walked over to New Hampshire Street.</p>
<p>They were eating their dinner so I sat and helped Riku along with his while Bryn started in on the pumpkin. I took lots of photos of Riku's face when he saw what was inside it, while Bryn was carving and then of Riku making faces with pen on his own nursery school pumpkin. It was the most amazing thing to me to watch him hold that black pen so very carefully, draw two oval eyes in the right places, make a nose and then a long mouth, and then oh-so-carefully place a dot in the middle of each eye! I turned it around so he could do a second face.</p>
<p>He put a long eyebrow over the eyes this time and went back to put one on the first drawing. These fellows will absolutely need some brow plucking! The funniest thing of all to see though was his drawing a moustache over the mouth of one of them, all the while looking at Bryn's moustache... as though he were doing a portrait! Bryn says he will be down at Fisherman's Wharf in no time, bringing a little extra money into the house by doing portraits for tourists. </p>
<p>After this was finished there was just enough time to do a bit of the Ravensburger puzzle of Caillie's that I brought home for Riku. I really believed it would be much too hard for him, but he seems to have inherited his dad's and Caillie's talent at puzzles, as he was moving the pieces that I put down into the right places! I was really amazed at how quickly he has grasped the concept of this much more difficult kind of puzzle. </p>
<p>Riku wanted me to go to his room with him so we could "work at something". We moved trucks and cars around for a bit, pretending that there were "big accidents" and fire and policemen coming to help out. Riku is really wanting more and more one on one time with people now; he has always liked someone with him for some of the time, but this past week he insists that I join him in almost every car or truck or building activity. I guess now he feels he has enough drawing and looking at book time on his own and enjoys the company when his imagination is in high gear. </p>
<p>He was a tired fellow by 8 p.m. so I got him into his pajamas and left at 8:30. Lovely mild night outside; I enjoyed the walk home and instead of getting back to the paperwork as I intended to, just sat down to read through some magazines. It just seemed reasonable to end this relaxing day like this... I made my first and last cup of tea, read until I felt sleepy, answered a couple of emails, chatted with Gail on Skype for a while and went up to bed at 11 p.m. Feeling very relaxed here...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/10/two_visits_and_two_movies.html">Two Visits and Two Movies</a></h2>
								<p>Ah, Saturday, with the whole weekend in front of us! I had a leisurely morning, with a long shower, a nice egg and toast breakfast, and took my time reading the paper. I then got busy and did a great job clearing off the kitchen counter; I filed various piles of statements, etc., put photos and memorabilia away, and copied various bits of information I want to save, into the right places. It has been too long since my counters were clear! </p>
<p>Just as I was finishing this up, a little boy came beaming his way in for a little visit, bringing his parents along with him. They had brought the laundry over, and started up a load. Riku had a little play time and drawing time, before they left for the open studio at Kevin's. Doug and I had lunch and left for a double feature at 12:25, dashing out when we remembered we had to stop at the post office. </p>
<p>We saw "Grizzly Man" and "Everything is Iluminated"; the first was about what I expected it to be, a beautifully photographed movie, set in Alaska, but about quite a disturbed young man who felt at one with the bears. He and his girlfriend who both mauled and eaten; grizzly indeed as it was a true story. I liked the second movie a lot, as it dealt with looking for ancestors, a project I am always interested in. The acting was superb and the landscape beautiful; despite being a little sleepy I stayed awake for both movies. </p>
<p>Home for dinner, and just as we were about to sit down, back came Riku with his Dad. Even though they hadn't planned to stay long, Riku had time to do some drawing, do some "writing letters", we read a couple of stories, and then he told me he wanted to be a doctor. He insisted we go upstairs where he told me to sit on the floor, and then gave me a needle and looked at my "hurt". I rolled up my pant leg, gave him a cotton puff and a tongue scraper with a pointy end on it, and away he went! First he wiped my knee carefully with the cotton and when I "winced" he said so sweetly "oh honey" and told me "it's okay". Then he gave me a needle and rubbed it again and gave me another needle!, and finally I got a bandage on it. A real one for a pretend hurt, but he did a great job with it all. He even had me blowing and taking deep breaths during the needle part of it; he's a fast learner and a mighty fine doctor! </p>
<p>Uncle Frank sent out a few photos from our weekend with Glenn and Wendy; there were a few of the giant steaks Glenn had cooked up and we exchanged some emails over the next hour or so. </p>
<p>Gail and I were on Skype for a long time; meanwhile, Doug cropped some photos for me, and then we went up to watch a couple of taped shows. We were both pretty tired so Doug turned all the clocks back and we were in bed reading at 11:30. That sounds so much better than the 12:30 it really was!</p>
