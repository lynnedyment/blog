								<h2>A Quiet but Productive Day at Home</h2>
								<p>Short entry today... no children around to make the day more interesting! I slept until 8:15, which was amazing in itself, but gave me a later start than I had hoped for. I showered immediately, came down and made myself an egg and two slices of the delicious bread Bryn brought over yesterday. With only one crust left, it seemed silly not to finish it off, so I did, spreading it thickly with almost-the-last of Auntie Rita's delicious grape jelly. I will be so sad when it is all gone. </p>
<p>Kelly emailed before I awoke; she and Gregg, Mykayla, and Bry', were on their way to Parry Sound to pick up Bryn and Caillie, and then all are heading for a week in the Manitoulin with Gregg's parents. Sherri and her two children are going to join them there for three days. Sherri is Kelly's friend from high school; she and her husband moved from BC to near Sudbury last fall and this will be their second visit with Kelly in the Manitoulin. It's less than a two-hour drive for them to visit there. </p>
<p>I got right to work on Riku's online album; I am copying all of the photos of him of this year, from various albums, into his main album. This way, it will be much easier, in the future, to copy just his, or Amelia's (hers is next) and not worry about missing any when I print. It is astounding, though, just how many photos I have of these children! How I love my digital camera, but am very grateful that Doug is behind the scenes, doing the uploading, cropping, and placement of them into the right albums. He also does the photos for the blogs for me; he is way behind on this, though, and just tonight got back to it. He is now finished the 2004 blogs, so has a long long way to go! </p>
<p>Whenever I needed a break from sitting or moving photos around, I took care of a little household job that needed doing. Today, I mixed two pounds of butter for our "better-butter", made Doug's second cheesecake so that he and Bryn have a little more. There wasn't a slice left after his birthday dinner and now he has a whole one to eat up... until Bryn discovers that it is here. </p>
<p>I also cleaned out the fridge, a job that has been neglected for the past two weeks. I cooked up some rhubarb to serve with Devon custard, a dessert that Doug and I are awfully fond of, and ate a lot of in England. I had it often as a child too, but served with hot Bird's custard; it's so delicious served either way. </p>
<p>Mid-afternoon, Doug went off to Safeway for yogurt and a few things on my list; I stayed home, deciding not to move out of the house today. This is not good, I know, but I really wanted the whole day at home... and got it! </p>
<p>Doug brought home four cobs of white corn, and we had it for dinner, along with some of the bits and pieces from the fridge... leftover spicy Indian garbanzo beans from lunch yesterday, a tiny bit of spinach I cooked up for me with pine nuts and olive oil (I love this!), vegetarian "sausage", and lots of raw veggies (carrots, celery, tomato, and cucumber) for me. </p>
<p>After dinner, I was surprisingly inspired to wipe down my kitchen cupboards thoroughly. Normally, I would do this tomorrow but I know it will be better to walk in tomorrow with that job done already. And perhaps it will inspire me to get the vacuum cleaner out too. The tiny, fine seeds from a tree in the garden have invaded the kitchen; the door has been open almost the entire day for the past few days, and now the inside is beginning to look like the outside. I am inclined to take the vacuum cleaner outside and suck up all the debris from around the deck at least, and maybe from the closest rocks in the garden as well! I also watered all the outside plants Susan kindly bought and planted for me two or three weeks ago. They are blooming merrily away and add some much-needed colour to the back yard and front steps. </p>
<p>Bryn called to ask if we wanted to join him and Riku at the park; Riku had had a three hour nap, and they were out for some fresh air and exercise. It was just as I was about to prepare dinner; Doug was hungry and wanted to eat a little earlier tonight. I have had so little interest in cooking lately that we have been eating later than ever before. </p>
<p>I got back to the photos, as moving a block of them takes a huge amount of time; as they get copied from one album to another, they are placed at the very bottom of the album, and moving them one at a time is very time-consuming. </p>
<p>Riku called me at 9 p.m. to say goodnight. For the first time tonight, when I said "Hello honey", he said it back to me. It is a highlight of my day to hear that little voice at his bedtime, especially on those days when I haven't seen him. He told me he is going to visit with his friend Alex tomorrow, which will be fun for him, and ended our conversation by saying a very sweet "Goodnight sweetheart", "I love you" and with a big smacky kiss at the end of it.</p>
<p>The phone call came just as I was ready for another break, so we went upstairs, me with my tea and plate of veggies, and watched a taped doo-wop gospel music special, lots of it not our favourite music, so we fast-forwarded past the ones we weren't enjoying. "The Jordanaires", Elvis' original back-up group, were on and just amazing, sounding as they always did! </p>
<p>Had a little IM time with Bryn tonight; here are some quotes from him... we explained to riku at dinner about the "new plan"<br />
Lynne says:<br />
which is?<br />
bryn says:<br />
told him that once the lights are out, there's no talking<br />
bryn says:<br />
if he talks, then mommy won't stay with him<br />
bryn says:<br />
instead, he'll get daddy... which i know isn't ideal (me being the punishment)<br />
bryn says:<br />
however, i'm fine with it<br />
bryn says:<br />
anyway, he was chattering away with akane after lights-out<br />
bryn says:<br />
so akane came out...<br />
bryn says:<br />
we gave him "one more chance"... didn't hear a peep afterward<br />
Lynne says:<br />
great!</p>
<p>Lynne says:<br />
Karyn said today that Riku looks so much like you! She thought it was his smile perhaps. Akane says more people are saying that too, although I see many of Akane's mannerisms in him lately</p>
<p>Lynne says:<br />
Today Riku helped me fold the two blankets he uses during his naps... he took one side and I took the other... he likes his room tidy.. interesting, but then so did you</p>
<p>bryn says:<br />
he helped carry stuff upstairs today<br />
bryn says:<br />
carried the banana bread up.... wanted to participate<br />
Lynne says:<br />
he is a helper for sure...<br />
Lynne says:<br />
he pulls up the chair to help cook, and today helped load up a bag with things for the baby!</p>
<p>Lynne says:<br />
he is such a special little boy<br />
bryn says:<br />
i'm glad you think so!<br />
Lynne says:<br />
yeah, me and the universe!</p>
<p>Back downstairs after the tapes tv show I came down for more photo work, but it's time for b now... 11:15 p.m.</p>
