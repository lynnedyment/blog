								<h2>Terrific Tuesday</h2>
								<p>Riku arrived early this morning, at 8:10, before I had finished drying my hair. Once I was dressed, Riku helped me make the bed; he walked in my room and said "this bed is all messy!"; it's usually made by the time he arrives but when it isn't he helps me with it. He likes me to fluff up the duvet so that it blows on him, and then he seriously pulls up the corner and straightens the side for me. He's a big helper; he very much likes to be tidy but his dad was like that too. </p>
<p>It was a busy morning once we came downstairs; I made Riku a big bowl of porridge with slivered almonds and strawberries, made myself a big bowl too, we both ate, and then it was time to pack up lunches. We had a big adventure in store for us. Doug, Riku, and I drove down to San Jose to meet up with Susan and Amelia at a fantastic fountain in the downtown area. Both children napped for an hour on the way, and Amelia was gung-ho to take off her sandals and move amongst the dozen or so water jets. Riku was content to sit on his Grandpa's lap for fifteen minutes or so, despite Amelia's encouragement to take off his sandals, take her hand, and get wet with her. I think he was still tired and needed a little more time to come 'round. </p>
<p>Eventually he did come in with us; Susan and I also had our sandals off. We all got wet, and Riku put his arms out to touch the tall sprays of water, but wasn't interested in being swung into the water as Amelia was. Riku is still coughing occasionally, although wasn't while we were there, but he is just not up to par for vigourous playing yet. It hasn't curbed his appetite at all though, as he ate a huge portion of pasta with kale and chopped tomatoes as soon as we arrived, sat happily eating grapes, polished off some custard and more berries, and drank a container of "Super Food"! ... oh, and ate a half slice of whole wheat raisin toast too, finishing off the rest on the way home. </p>
<p>The downtown area had been sectioned off for a Grand Prix race happening this weekend, so parking and driving around was a bit of a challenge. Doug went off to do the rounds of book and record stores, and I walked Riku to "The Children's Discovery Museum" while Susan drove with Amelia. This way we didn't have to move Riku's car seat. It was a fast ten-minute walk and due to the parking problems, I was there for almost a half hour before Susan and Amelia arrived. </p>
<p>What a wonderful place this was for the children. Amelia has been before but it was Riku's first time. He loved it! When we first walked in, there was a full-sized fire engine, so he explored the outside, opening the doors and panels, containing clothing and hoses, then climbed aboard steering and moving whatever switches he could see. From there he went into an ambulance; a little girl lay down on a stretcher and Riku immediately covered her up with a blanket! Perhaps he will be a paramedic or a doctor. </p>
<p>There was a TV screen with a man singing "Old MacDonald Had a Farm", the various animals appearing behind him. Was this ever a hit with him! He doesn't see these programs and I think he so enjoyed seeing a familiar song brought to life. "Big Bird" was on another screen, with Cookie Monster too and they got some time as well. It might be time to introduce him to a half hour of Sesame Street. He did see a bit last week, certainly enjoyed it, and wasn't happy when I turned it off! </p>
<p>We wandered around for about fifteen minutes, putting his hands in bubble water, watching the big children make giant bubbles, using (on his own) an old-fashioned wringer (which he quite enjoyed, getting all the water out of two t-shirts), and climbing up a big platform and looking down at all the children. </p>
<p>The biggest hit of all, though, was the water room, for children under four years of age. It contained a huge water table, which was an immediate hit! Despite having a plastic apron on, Riku got quite wet, with his enthusiasm for all the things he could do in this room. Amelia was with him in there too, and the two of them had such a great time. They could balance balls on water spouts, throw balls into a whirlpool and watch them spiral down, but spent just as much time filling up containers and dumping the water back in wherever they happened to be at the time. </p>
<p>We ended our visit here with fifteen minutes in the face painting room. Riku and I had stepped in earlier, and had seen moms carefully painting their children's faces. Amelia and Riku had different ideas; they just walked into the now-empty room, picked up brushes, dipped them into the paint, and worked away on their canvases! Oh my! Riku chose a very dark green for the left side of his face with some brights for the right. He took it very seriously, watching himself in the mirror while he worked away. Meanwhile, Amelia decided that her nostrils and mouth needed a little more colour. Susan was just howling while she watched all this going on! After a few photos Amelia was taken off to have her face washed, after which Susan did some adorable freckles, a red nose, and spotted cheeks too. She and I did a little face painting ourselves, but neither was as interesting as the children's. </p>
<p>Doug had trouble parking in order to pick Riku and me up, but we finally connected twenty minutes later than we planned. We said our goodbyes to Susan and Amelia, with Susan suggesting that we do one more major trip a week, rather than just the local playgrounds. I know how quickly the summer is going to fly by, with September coming up so quickly, so we must do this. </p>
<p>Riku napped for an hour on the way home, and walked into the house ready to play with the new baby doll I found on Sunday, a fuzzy ugly little animal creature, and his dog. He bundled them all up carefully in a blanket and carried them around the house, being such a gentle daddy to them. At one point, he handed them to me to babysit while he went off to find his Grandpa. He was cooing away, pretending to change the baby, when he came back downstairs, assuring her/him that he/she was okay. So very sweet. </p>
<p>He had two long breadsticks and a tiny piece of cheesecake; he told Doug it was yummy, when Doug told him it was yucky, pretending to take it away. Riku also broke out into "Itsy-Bitsy Spider" again, using the action for it and asked me to sing "Twinkle, Twinkle" with him too. </p>
<p>Bryn called a little later to say he was coming over early for Riku; Riku decided he would stay in his chair at the table and I could read him lots of books. Doug read through half of his new Red Train book with him, while I tidied up, and then I took over and read all of his "kitchen" books. I tried to take some of this big stack into his room, but Riku told me they stayed in the kitchen. He has living room books, the front bedroom books, his own room books, and the master bedroom books, and I guess that is how he wants it! We managed to get through about five books before his Daddy insisted that it was time to go home and play with the Domino set Doug gave him. They left about 6:30, and Doug and I had a very quick simple dinner of greens and some mac' and cheese. Doug had, of course, cheesecake for dessert. Bryn had some this morning before he left for work too! </p>
<p>I wrote a letter to Noriko tonight, the second mom I met in the park in Japan. Two down, no telling how many to go! Too many... but getting there. </p>
<p>Candy also wrote today to say she was going to be in the Falls when I am there in September. What good news! It's always more fun with someone to travel around with, especially when visiting brothers and sisters, and Uncle Frank too! </p>
<p>Elizabeth called to confirm that two queen-sized beds would be fine in one room for our trip to San Diego a week Thursday; this week too will fly by. </p>
<p>Doug and I just watched a PBS documentary on a man who chose to commit suicide, rather than face heart surgery and deal with prostate cancer; his daughter made the film and it was a little tough to watch the effect this decision had on his family, much as they understood his need to be in control of his life, and his death. </p>
<p>And that's it... bedtime at 11:19. Perhaps tonight is the night that I turn the light out before midnight and manage to get up before 8 a.m. tomorrow. </p>
<p>... a note; I mustn't close without saying that Riku called at 8:50 to say goodnight to me. He told me he was in his PJs, had had tofu for dinner, and he and his daddy had played with the dominoes... and then wished me "goodnight dolly" and blew me a kiss. I missed my call last night... Bryn was at ping pong.</p>
