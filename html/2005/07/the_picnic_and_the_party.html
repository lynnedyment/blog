								<h2>The Picnic and the Party</h2>
								<p>At 8:15 a.m., while I was still asleep!, I heard a little boy calling "Nana, Nana!" I buried my head under the duvet and peeked out to see Riku looking behind the bedroom door for me! I had told Bryn last night that I would happily babysit Riku while he and Akane were busy preparing picnic food for later on today. Doug played "farm" with him on the floor in the bedroom while I quickly showered. </p>
<p>Bryn decided today that he would make me a birthday cake after all. Doug claims I made him feel very guilty about it, but really!... all I said was that I was very disappointed, but understood perfectly that life was busy, and that the very small, but good quality, cake that Doug bought would be just fine. </p>
<p>He had dropped Riku at the door downstairs, Riku rang the bell, and Doug went down to find Riku proudly standing there! Bryn phoned almost immediately to say he was on his way over to bake a German chocolate cake for me. I can't say that I tried very hard to disuede him. If there is a homemade cake at the end of the day, made by a member of my family, so much the better!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Riku and I were upstairs. I tidied up the room a bit and finished drying my hair while Riku played. He is so funny lately; he will say "TV?" knowing perfectly well I wil say no to him. I went back in to the bathroom for a minute, and came back with Riku looking very guilty; he had been pushing various buttons trying to make the tv turn on! I will certainly allow him to watch Sesame Street occasionally (after all, his Daddy loved the show at the same age), but at 10 a.m. he is always close to his naptime, and I would rather he was being more active before his nap, then than watching tv, so it won't happen often.  </p>
<p>Riku went to bed late last night and was up early this morning so Bryn hoped that he would have a good nap here before leaving for the picnic at 12:30. Despite eating a very good sized bowl of hot cereal, reading some stories, and playtime, and so obviously being tired, for some reason he just could not let go for his nap. He was so very close, his eyes closed, but then would scratch his neck or his back, or lift a leg up, or drum on his tummy... and I finally just gave in and let him up. </p>
<p>Bryn was busy making the cake and Riku was happy to join in. He dragged his little red chair over to the counter and watched the mixer turning around and around, and scraping the sides of the bowl when it stopped. I had made a list of things I wanted to take with me, so got started on that, made Riku some lunch for the car and the picnic, and got ready to get out of Bryn's way as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>Doug wanted to check out a book store over town, which was great, as the longer Riku is in the moving car the better. Still, he took a long time to fall asleep, holding out for twenty minutes. Arggh! Just when he needed it so much too. He lasted an hour, still tired though, but ate a good lunch (a hard boiled egg, raisin toast and some fruit) before getting to Baker Beach. I had worried that we would be late, as Doug took much longer in his book store than I had thought he would, but we were there just a minute before Bryn and Akane arrived, and about ten minutes before Susan, Amelia, and Kevin. Amelia's nap started later than Susan had thought it would. </p>
<p>The beach seemed too cool and windy so we set up our picnic at a table further inland. Akane had prepared some delicious battered mushrooms and broccoli, Bryn had made a very tasty pasta salad, Susan brought her wonderful potato salad with apple pieces in it, and chocolate cupcakes for dessert, as well as some cold beverages. Doug and I took two different cheeses, and I had boiled some eggs. We were quite protected here and it was more comfortable than the beach would have been on this overcast day. We immediately ate our lunch, as the children were more than ready to get moving and explore! Susan and Doug went off into the woods with Amelia and Riku, Brent showed up for lunch with us then, and we chatted until the others returned from their exploring and stick collecting adventure. </p>
<p>First the big guys climbed in the trees, and the little guys followed suit, with a little help. And then it was time for some touch football (after Kevin, Bryn, and Brent had tried hitting each other with the ball from a distance!); Amelia and Riku had such fun taking their turns and chasing after and throwing the ball too. They loved this time and Doug said had a great time in the woods too. What a day for them! Susan said we must do this more often, and not just on special occasions, and I agree. It's relaxing, is a lovely change of pace, but mostly the children just love being out of doors and wandering about aimlessly. </p>
<p>It started to get chilly, so about 4 pm. we headed for home, cake and presents, and a hot cup of tea. I was more than ready for the hot tea; it was chilly at the beach once it got later. </p>
<p>Bryn had the cakes cooling on racks, and the dishes he had used all washed up. I put them away and tidied up the picnic leftovers too, and made tea. Akane tucked herself away in the front bedroom, Susan sat in the car, with a cup of tea, while Amelia napped, Doug and Bryn continued working on the Sudoku puzzle they had started earlier at the picnic (after Bryn had put the topping on the cake), and Kevin and Riku ran madly around the house, hiding and squealing madly! How Riku loves this kind of play! All was in order in the kitchen so I took Riku upstairs for block building while Kevin had a much needed nap. He was up late last night entertaining an old friend from high school in Alaska. Riku has just started eating raw carrot sticks so he and I shared a plate of vegies, after he ate some hot pasta with cooked vegies in it, while we played. </p>
<p>Susan called from the car, where Amelia was still napping at 6:40!, to suggest ordering pizza in for dinner; no one was terribly hungry but we all needed to eat something, so I quickly defrosted some homemade tomato sauce for spaghetti, mixed a green salad, made up a plate of fresh mozzarella cheese and tomatoes, and buttered a half loaf of crusty bread with garlic butter, putting it in the oven to crisp up. </p>
<p>Amelia woke up and she and Susan came in just as Riku had been put in the tub; there was time for it, and it seemed a good idea. Akane took over while I finished up dinner preparations. He had filled the tub with every one of his tub toys, and you can barely see Riku for the toys! </p>
<p>As it was so late, and the pasta wasn't quite ready, I prepared a fresh bath for Amelia and Susan and Kevin took care of her as I put dinner on the table. </p>
<p> The food disappeared quite quickly so I guess the fresh air gave us more of an appetite than we realized. The children, of course, were anxious to get to the candle blowing, the cake, and the gift opening. They both sat at my end of the table and helped me, very efficiently, with all three of these. It was great fun having them take part! </p>
<p>Gifts.... lots of certificates for wonderful gifts!... six communal baths at the Kabuki from Kelly and Gregg, a hand painted big cup and saucer from Amelia with her finger and footprints on them, a membership for two to the Bay Area Discovery Museum from Susan and Kevin, a perfect gift for Riku and me! and time with Amelia and Susan as well at one of their favourite places, a very generous gift certificate for one of my favourite book stores, from Akane and Bryn,  lots and lots of great books from Doug, opened last night, plus a Japanese book on the tea ceremony, complete with bowl, cloth, whisk and incense, and a Kabuki gift certificate for a full session massage and two communal baths! Judi gave me a box of lovely embossed acid free note paper, which will certainly come in handy, with all the notes I have to write. And of course my two beautiful bouquets added to making this day very special. The cake was yummy! Both children dug right in, and Amelia even dug into my slice as well. </p>
<p>Bryn had quickly cleaned most of the pots and dinner prep' dishes, and Doug helped clear the table and tidy up, so in no time the house was ship-shape. </p>
<p>The party broke up late, considering there were two little ones here celebrating with us... what a lovely time we all had, but especially me, the birthday girl!  </p>
