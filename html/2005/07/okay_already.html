								<h2>Okay, Already!</h2>
								<p>Doug reminded me tonight, as he headed up to bed, that we had a pretty uneventful day around here today, and that I really could do a very short blog. So, here goes! (He's right, I know; I intended writing a short blog yesterday and it was long!)</p>
<p>Okay, got lots done today... no children though. Sad. Two days now. I'm in withdrawal, but... the kitchen looked great when I walked down this morning, nice clean counters, shining sink, so I was inspired after breakfast to get right to the vacuuming on this floor, and did indeed vacuum up some of that fluffy seed from the back deck! Filled up the bag, but at least it is not sitting ready to blow into the kitchen immediately. Cleaned two bathrooms, did all the laundry.. but no ironing as I intended. </p>
<p>Made Doug's lunch, a rare event, and he was very happy to have his cheesecake for dessert too. This was a reward for all the blog photos he worked on for me this morning. Now it's up to me to complete some of the missing blogs; some are in draft form and just need finishing up. </p>
<p>Nice quick dinner... big salad with feta cheese (yum!), and vegetable potstickers. There was even dessert tonight when Doug asked, the stewed rhubarb and cold Devon custard. It was too good for me to turn down; I don't usually eat dessert. And it was an extra fruit for me today! </p>
<p>The biggest accomplishment of the day was I finally finished sorting through that massive pile of loose papers! Halleluha! The nice tidya individual stacks are not put away yet, but it was the sifting through all the bits of paper that have collected over the past months, and months!, that were driving me crazy, and now it's done! Yahoo! </p>
<p>After that was finished I had no excuse not to sit down and write to the young mom in Japan, and to a very young daughter of a friend in Toronto too. Crossed those two items off a very long list. </p>
<p>Early this evening I decided to make an album for Riku's little friend Tomoha in Japan, rather than send her mom a dozen or so photos of the two of them. Doug helped me with the layout after I had cropped them, he did the title page with matte as well, and then the lettering too with their names on the front page, beneath a really sweet photo of the two of them. Doug is such a perfectionist that it's not hard for him to want to make sure it is done evenly or in the best position. I was more than grateful for the help! He even parcelled it up for me with lots of bubble wrap and now it's all ready to mail out tomorrow. </p>
<p>Amelia called and said "HI!" in the biggest voice tonight! It was so wonderful to chat with her; she says "uh huh" to almost every question I ask so it's always fun to hear what she may (or may not) have done today. I thought I might see her today, but Susan hadn't been at her computer after early this morning and didn't check her phone for messages either! </p>
<p>I hope to see them tomorrow; I did get lots done though so perhaps it was meant to be that I just stick with it. It's always easy to decide to play instead of work! </p>
<p>Gail is back online, thank goodness. Her computer has been down since she and Tom arrived back from a week long holiday a week ago Saturday. There are certainly fewer emails when Gail is away, although Candy has been very good lately with lots of little notes. </p>
<p>Off I go! It will be a Riku and an Amelia day tomorrow. </p>
<p>Bedtime... 11:10 p.m. Not bad!</p>
