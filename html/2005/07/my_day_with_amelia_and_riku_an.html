								<h2>My Day with Amelia and Riku.. and a Red Letter Day!</h2>
								<p>This was a busy busy day and it flew by! I was out the door at 8:20 to pick Riku up for school; Bryn has his Japanese class on Wednesdays and leaves work early, so it's best if he doesn't also get there later as well. It was a very successful drop-off today as Riku walked in as happily as could be and went directly to the sticker table. I said a quick goodbye and left, leaving him with one of the younger teachers. What a relief! I only took him to school three times, I think, and the first time was really tough for him and for me, the second time better but still some tears, and then today... voila! He has been this way with Bryn all week, although there were days he would say "no school" but go in without a fuss. </p>
<p>Susan met me outside the school with Amelia and I switched her over to my car. Susan had a 9:30 appointment and I suggested she take until 12:30 for herself, as I had to be in the neighbourhood to pick up Riku at 1 p.m. </p>
<p>Amelia was awake before 6 a.m. today and her mom thought she would be ready for her nap by 10 a.m. We drove to her house, went upstairs and took enough time for Amelia to show me her Pee Wee Herman doll, and read a book with me while I ate some fruit and yogurt for breakfast. Amelia loves to take us by the hand and lead us about, and today was no exception; we wandered into her room to look at her animals, into the living room where she tried to talk me into "TV?" and some running in the hallway, which she so enjoys. </p>
<p>We picked up the stroller, and Amelia pushed it across the street to the playground. It was quite chilly there, and so I gravitated to the sunny swing area rather than the sandbox. Thank goodness Amelia was happy on the swings as there was quite a cool breeze blowing. It had already started to heat up in Potrero Hill and I couldn't believe how big the drop in temperature was on the other side of the big hill over there! Brrr! </p>
<p>AT 10:10 Amelia was in the stroller and she was sound asleep at 10:15. I walked with her around Stow Lake twice, and as it was getting busy with lots of noisy walkers, headed out on the sidewalk heading towards Ocean Beach. I turned around in time to get us back to Susan's at 12:40. Amelia slept for two and a half hours on the nose. </p>
<p>Susan was just walking over to the Panhandle to meet us.. with a full thermos of perfect hot tea for me, and a baggie of cookies for Riku and me, as well as a basket of organic blueberries, strawberries, and a box of black tea from Trader Joe's. This girl really does spoil me! </p>
<p>We planned to meet at Ocean Beach after Riku's nap, if he slept in the car. It was a bit foggy and cooler at that end of town but still seemed like a good idea. </p>
<p>At 1 p.m. I picked Riku up; I sat in the back seat with him while he gobbled up a big container of yogurt and blueberries, two cookies, a big drink of " Super Food" and a few nuts... and then he was asleep before coming within view of the big rainbow flag in the Castro District, less than a five minute drive away! I turned around and headed back towards the beach, parked there, and read for the two and a half hours that Riku napped! </p>
<p>He woke up quite groggy and even though he could see the rolling waves was not in a big hurry to get out and explore. This is such atypical behaviour for him, but he is really wiped after his long and busy morning. Riku always tells me they sang songs, and had snacks, and played with blocks, but will also say that he did not play with the children! </p>
<p>Susan and Amelia were already on the beach, so after a bit Riku was ready to join them. I snuggled him up in a big towel, carried him down and he sat cozied up to me for about ten minutes. Amelia wanted to sit on my other leg so much and get snuggled and covered with the blanket too, but Riku would have none of it. Susan, however, had a kite with her, with a nice big Canadian flag on it!, and Riku finally decided he would like to get up and see it. Amelia took the opportunity to take the towel, and cuddle up on her Mommy's lap for a few minutes. She too seemed sleep despite her long morning nap. I had gotten out of the car earlier and was amazed to see Amelia just sitting on the blanket with her mom, and not running about. Amelia is not a child who sits long willingly very often! </p>
<p>True to form though she was up, helping to fly the kite, trying to entice Riku to chase the gulls, and finally getting all of us to hold hands and run down the beach quite a distance. Susan let both children hold the kite which was very brave of her as she had to catch it twice as they let go of the handle! Riku was happy sitting with a pail and shovel too for a while, his favourite thing to do on the beach. We must get out as often as we can to some of the area beaches, as September will be here too soon and the opportunity will be gone. </p>
<p>We got home about 5:30 and I phoned to ask Akane if she would like to come over for dinner; that sounded "very nice" to her so I quickly cooked up some pasta, added some homemade tomato sauce, made Doug a green salad with the last of the greens, and cooked up spinach with pine nuts and garlic for Akane, Riku, and me. Riku had some udon noodle soup with carrots, tofu, some spinach and leftover broccoli bits from his lunch. Akane fed him while he was drawing, and then I took over when we all sat down to eat. Riku had a good appetite and ate more than I expected he would. And for dessert we all had Devon custard with some of the fresh strawberries from Susan. Yum! </p>
<p>I popped Riku in the tub right after dinner, as Akane is still having trouble lifting him, and Riku decided he would put "all the toys" in the tub! It was quite full when this was done but he was so happy playing with the stick-on letters (I spelled out Riku Dyment on the side of the tub which pleased Riku very much), and Robin, and the tubs with holes in them, and three boats too! </p>
<p>Bryn had been at work late tonight, and not at his class after all, so he came in while Riku was still in the tub. Riku was looking a little uncomfortable in the tub and both Bryn and I suspected he might have to have a BM. He denied it, and Bryn told him he could get out or we could put a diaper on him, but he said "no" so we let him be. Alone with him a few minutes later, I saw him raise his eyebrows and he said "uh oh!" and I quickly pulled him out and sat him on the toilet, where he had his first BM on the toilet! It may be the last for a while but we shall see. He was looking a little worried about it all, but broke into big smiles when we all clapped and congratulated him. I had bought a toy tractor and hay wagon in Japan for this very event and Riku was a very happy boy with his newest toy. </p>
<p>I got him into his clothes and ready to go home and then we sat on the sofa reading while Akane and Bryn played their first game of Sudoku, the Japanese number game played on the computer. Riku was a tired little fellow when they left at 8:30 and I didn't have my goodnight phone call from him, as I had big hugs and kisses so soon before his bedtime. </p>
<p>I cleaned up the tub and the kitchen, got the garbage and recycling ready for Doug, who had gone over to Safeway for yogurt and bananas, and was ready to sit in bed with a hot cup of tea watching a taped video with Doug when he returned. Of course, after this busy day I fell asleep about half way through the hour show. Doug had to fill me in on who did what when, while I washed and brushed my teeth. I think I read two pages of my new book (a detective story set in Cambridge) before falling asleep.</p>
