								<h2>Thursday... Feels Like Friday!</h2>
								<p>Slept in 'til 7:15 this morning; felt wonderful to roll over at 6 a.m. and drop off again! Out the door at 8:30 to pick Riku up for nursery school. He was pretty quiet on the way over and I thought me might drop off to sleep, even though Bryn told me he was still sleeping when he left the house at 7:30. </p>
<p>Riku walked willingly to the door of the school with me and then wanted up in my arms. The main teacher greeted him, took him from me and held him; we both pointed out the bags of coloured paper for each child and paper birds hanging from the rafters. Riku was distracted and I put his bag in his cubby, saying goodbye as I walked by. He started to cry with his hands over his eyes, but when I picked him up at 1 p.m. I was told that he had cried for just a few minutes. </p>
<p>It was a special Japanese holiday so Riku came home with the bag of coloured papers, and two large fronds from a plant of some kind. I sat in the back seat with him, fed him a large bowl of porridge with blueberries and strawberries, he drank lots of water, and wanted a cookie as well. Luckily, I had a couple of digestives and a ginger snap with me, so that worked out just fine. </p>
<p>My goal was to get him home for his nap, but despite lots of "sing farm chicken" singing, those eyes were drooping almost immediately. Riku slept from 1:20 until 2:50 in a shady spot on 17th Street. When he awoke I started to drive home, just a few minutes away, and within one minute he was sound asleep again! This time I parked over in my neighbourhood where it was a little quieter and shady as well, and he was in a deep sleep until 3:40. </p>
<p>Riku was still a little dozey and teary when I took him out of his car seat, so had to go upstairs with him in my arms, plus his lion, the last of his snack, and the dog and blanket I had with me for his head and the breeze... and of course his lunch/kit bag, and the paper bag, and the two large fronds! I am woman, hear me roar! </p>
<p>Akane was at the door and she was ready to decorate using the paper he had brought home. I came right home, had some lunch, and got busy with the paper work covering my kitchen table, and back to ordering hundreds of prints online! Ah yes, I must get busy getting them into albums. I also called the doula co-ordinator as I am determined to get working on that as soon as I can. </p>
<p>Quiet evening at home; I chatted with Susan and Amelia after Amelia left a lovely message on my answering machine. She had a twelve hour sleep last night! and a three hour nap today! after which she said "Nana?" so Susan had her call me. The message from Amelia? "Hi Nana!" and "I love you"... very clear to me as I have heard her say it before, and then "goodbye". We had a little chat too. </p>
<p>Skyped with Gail for a few minutes, exchanged two very sweet emails with Uncle Frank, and then went off to pick up Doug from his 8:45 flight from LA. The bombing in London today did not affect airport security at all; Doug thinks the line was shorter than it has been in the recent past.</p>
<p>There was a message on the machine from Bryn, left at 8:50, saying Riku had been calling to say goodnight... and I missed it. Darn! I look forward to my goodnight calls.  </p>
<p>Have completed my online photo order, thank goodness, after some help from Susan with two problems... </p>
<p>Off to bed at 11:15 p.m.</p>
