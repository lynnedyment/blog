								<h2>A Visit to Walnut Creek</h2>
								<p>A few weeks ago, I came across an article on two interesting children's museums and sent it to Susan. Last night she suggested we take the children to one of them today, and so we did. Riku arrived at 9 a.m. and I was busy making up lunches for Doug (who had decided to join us after looking at their Web site), Riku, and me. I also made up some breakfast for Riku to eat in the car, so it was a busy hour or so. Riku wanted to play, but Doug was showering and I was busy in the kitchen; I realized Riku was being very quiet, and peeked in to see him sitting on the sofa going through all his books. He was there for at least fifteen minutes, with not a peep out of him. Extraordinary! </p>
<p>Akane called with some very good news; the results of the amniocentesis are back and all is looking very well for a healthy baby, and it is now confirmed that this a girl! Akane and Bryn are both thrilled, as are we of course! </p>
<p>We left later than I had hoped, at 10 a.m. I sat in the back with Riku, as usual, feeding him cereal and looking at books with him. He was fading fast though, so I rolled down the windows and he was fast asleep in minutes. He only slept for thirty-five minutes, waking soon after we arrived at the Lindsay Wildlife Museum in Walnut Creek. Doug and I sat reading in the car for about ten minutes until he awoke.</p>
<p>Originally Susan had suggested we take her car, but we decided that if one child needed more sleep the other one wouldn't necessarily be quiet enough for this to happen. For now, two cars seemed like the better idea.  </p>
<p>Once in the museum, Riku took great pleasure in the little red stamp they put on all our hands. He showed it off several times over the course of the day with him and wanted to see ours too. Funny how these little things mean so much to children at this age. We watched two very active squirrels in cages when we first went in, but Riku soon spotted two big floor puzzles and off he went to do those. Amelia and Susan had arrived earlier, and after Amelia's thirty-five minute sleep, joined Riku working on the puzzles.</p>
<p>From then on the children just explored whatever took their fancy. One very popular item was a giant stuffed animal toy of a Bald Eagle. Both children were wild about him and spent a lot of time running around him, hiding under his wings, and hugging him. It was really cute to watch. They were far less interested in the live animals all around them although did stop now and then to watch for a few minutes. They found a little side room where they could run, and run they did, chasing one another and shrieking not too loudly. </p>
<p>The museum is set on a huge piece of property, quite lovely and well kept-up. There were picnic tables, lots of grass, a playground, and even a pool (which we didn't know about). No food is available, which is why we had packed lunches. Riku was hungry, despite his runny nose, and ate a very large portion of mac' and cheese with veggies, grapes and strawberries, and some cookies and juice. Amelia sat and ate her lunch too, at Susan's insistence, as she was ready to head off to the playground asap. </p>
<p>While the adults sat and enjoyed the goodies Susan had provided... pain au chocolat!, pastries, and chocolate bars from Canada (which we resisted only because there wasn't room for them!) and drinking the Cokes Doug had packed in ice, Amelia and Riku wandered off on their own. It was so cute to see; usually Amelia is taking Riku's hand, and is quite put out when he refuses to go along with it, but today Riku did the reaching out to her, as well as holding her around the middle while standing in front of her! Amelia was feeling a mite independent today, and didn't always choose to let him hold her hand. </p>
<p>Because the area was so wide open and huge we let them wander off a considerable distance. They spent quite a bit of time poking around near a big tree, Riku finding sticks and Amelia following suit, and then strolling off hand in hand back toward the museum. They came back when we called, though, and then we saw Riku putting something down the front of Amelia's top. I went over to see what it was as we wondered if they were sticks!, but no, it was grass that he was picking! Amelia didn't mind a bit, as mostly it was falling down the top and out the bottom of it. </p>
<p>We tidied up our table and went bck into the museum to watch the mountain lion being fed. It was a little too graphic for me; Doug had seen it from the very beginning, when the food was hidden in a box and hung from an overhead rafter for the mountain lion to attack. We got there in time to see the end of his tearing through the box to discover a large rat, which he started to nibble on, beginning at the head. The policy at this museum is not to feed live animals to the animals, but the volunteer explained to us that even though the "prey" was dead, the lion would eat the head first... in the wild it could do some damage to the lion if still live. The children lost interest fairly quickly and went back to the stuffed, giant eagle. Amelia kept saying "playground?" so off we went; Doug joined us about fifteen minutes later, very enthusiastic about all he had learned and seen. </p>
<p>Riku and Amelia kept busy with the swings (Amelia) and the sandbox (Riku), patting dogs and riding a mini-carousel. Both children were tired though and after Riku cried when the buckets he was using were taken away by their owners I realized he was very tired. We drove into Walnut Creek for a few minutes, as Doug wanted to go to a bookstore, and while Riku and I sat in the car reading all the books I had taken along, Riku spotted many people walking by eating ice-cream. I told him to ask Grandpa for some when he came back and he did. Doug walked up to the car and Riku said "Grandpa, buy ice-cream!" Doug was happy to oblige and went looking for the shop. I had asked Riku if he would like strawberry or vanilla and he said "vanilla" and ate every bite of a quite large container of it! "This is cold!" he said and pulled the little cotton blanket over himself. Five minutes later, after pulling away, he was sound asleep. Doug parked the car in a shady spot near the house and walked home. I was happy to sit and read for the hour extra he slept. Riku did waken once crying, so I knew he wasn't ready to waken so I drove around the block a few times and he was out again for the duration. </p>
<p>When he awoke he was his happy little self. As soon as we came in, Riku went right out into the garden, squirting the windows with a watering bottle, wandering about picking up sticks, and enjoying the cooler air here I'm sure; it was hot in Walnut Creek! </p>
<p>We had a little snack of fruit and a cookie or two, and sat reading lots of books. Riku never ever tires of this, snuggles right up against me on the sofa, asking lots of questions about what is going on. </p>
<p>Bryn came by at 7 p.m. to pick Riku up. Riku comes running to me, to "escape" his daddy taking him home, but is always fine, waving happily to me, once he has his shoes on and is heading downstairs. </p>
<p>Bryn had good news at work as well as he has a new boss, who looks promising.</p>
<p>Jody called just as I tidied up from the day, and we had a long chat. She has guests in the B&B and now that the weather is improving is hoping that there will be more guests the rest of the summer. The cold and rainy days have kept visitors to a minimum.  </p>
<p>I had eaten enough today that I wasn't at all hungry for dinner, so Doug had a small commercial burrito, I made tea, and we went upstairs to finish watching the last of the "Games of the Mind" DVD we started watching at Bryn's and Akane's last night. I stayed awake for all of it, as they are really well done and interesting, came downstairs and wrote a couple of emails, and turned off the light too late again, at 12:35. </p>
<p>... birthday card from Geraldine today.  </p>
