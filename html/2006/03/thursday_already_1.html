								<h2>Thursday Already!</h2>
								<p>How this week flew by! It was one of the busiest weeks ever so that no doubt explains it. Woke to a cold sunny day, which is a treat, as it is expected to be rainy and grey for the rest of it. After answering some emails, I dashed off to pick Riku up at 1o a.m. Spent a little time admiring Mirei who was busy nursing and then just lying serenely in her mommy's arms, looking around her. What a beautiful girl she is! </p>
<p>Riku greeted me at the door by saying "I just watching a movie and it's almost over, okay? Then I will come to your house" and later on said "Come and see my studio (which is what he calls his bedroom); I have many toys in there!" and he does. </p>
<p>He had an egg and some toast to eat, but wouldn't take even one bite of it, so after a few more moments with Mirei, off we went. I had driven over so that we could go to the playground for some fresh air and still get home in time for an early nap. I had a doctor's appointment for my annual physical, long overdue by years!, and we needed to leave the house at 3:30 p.m. </p>
<p>Riku didn't play at the playground, not even sitting in the sandbox... a first, but he did seem to enjoy watching three other children play nearby. We stayed for a half hour, as he needed some fresh air, but headed off for "Nana's house". Riku had a temperature and was feeling quite warm; he didn't want to play with Play-Doh or do any drawing but did want to go upstairs after sweetly tucking his squirrel into his own bed. He is going to be such a good daddy, as he wrapped squirrel up in a towel (his tail got a little wet coming up the stairs... "it's okay, it's okay" murmured Riku to him), turned on the sound machine, and quietly closed the door. </p>
<p>Off we went with a "picnic" tray... a sandwich and hot chocolate for me, and a whole orange for Riku in segments, a tiny cup of hot chocolate, and a waffle. He ate a good bit of it, but that little body was just so hot. Tuck in time at 12:15 and he was asleep at 12:20. Perfect! </p>
<p>I took the monitor upstairs and finished off the end of this week's ironing, and then sat and watched a taped Oprah show, calling Doug up to see the cast of one of our current favourite tv shows "Grey's Anatomy", as well as the puppeteer and voice of Elmo. </p>
<p>Riku woke a few times but was easily coaxed back to sleep, but his body was hot, and I'm sure he wasn't comfortable. His coughing seems a little less frequent and I gave him his third "puffer" of medicine before he went to bed. I hope this works although he does have an appointment with Dr. Steele on Monday.</p>
<p>He would easily have gone back to sleep again at 2:50, as he dozed off in my arms, but I needed to leave for the doctor's at 3:30. Poor wee guy. Two hours of sleep just wasn't quite enough for him. However, after dressing him and getting out to the car, he was in good spirits. Doug dropped me off at the doctor's, he and Riku walked along the street for a bit admiring all the dogs out being walked,</p>
