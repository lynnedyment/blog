								<h2>Happy Birthday, Bryn!</h2>
								<p>Thirty-eight years ago I gave birth to a beautiful red-haired baby boy. Each year, on my birthday, after I was grown and had left home, my Mom would call me and tell me about the day I was born. When Bryn called yesterday about when they would be picking the children up for breakfast, I told him that he was just eight hours old at that point, all those years ago, and what an easy baby he had been to deliver. I took a cab to the hospital (Doug was in Calgary on business, and Gram was there to watch Kelly for me), and we arrived at midnight on a cold, wintry, and icy Ottawa night. Bryn made his appearance a mere three hours later, at 3:13 a.m. No hard labour, no stitches, just a healthy 7 pounds 13-1/2 ounce baby boy. His birth completed our family of a girl and a boy. How interesting that both Kelly and Bryn have a boy and a girl as well; lucky us! </p>
<p>It was a busy day here, well captured in photos, so I shall make this brief (Ha! Ha!)... Uncle Bryn, Akane, Riku, Auntie Susan, Kevin, and Amelia invited Caillie and Bryn to "Just for You" for breakfast. This is a favourite brekkie place for us in Potrero Hill, specializing in homemade bread and beignets. Both children loved the latter, so I will take them back once more before they leave; I stayed home with sweet Mirei, who slept a little and played on the bed for a good long while.</p>
<p>Lunch at home, and there was time for two games of Aces; Caillie won both games and was delighted! Caillie had a little nap as she was feeling quite cold, a sure sign that our "hot girl" was not feeling well. I gave her a sweater Mom had made for me, and she finally warmed up.   </p>
<p>Uncle Bryn picked up the children at 2 p.m. for a mini-golf session in  the south Bay. They were gone for three hours and had a great time; the two Bryns tied with a score of 66 and Caillie got 76. Brynnie got a hole-in-one and two two-strokes!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back home, Doug was busy running birthday errands and I was taking care of Riku, who was supposed to have a nap here, but instead had it in the car at 11:30 with his parents. He needed more sleep but wasn't quite ready to give in as early as three p.m. He played happily making "dinner" with Play-Doh and all the dishes from his kitchen piled on the table. </p>
<p>Dinner was ready by 5 p.m.: three quiches, a big tray of olives, hummous, boiled eggs, roasted red peppers, tortilla chips and salsa, and wheat crackers, as well as carrot and celery sticks, and two baguettes. We set up the children's play table in the dining room, where Bryn, Caillie, and Amelia sat right next to us at the big table. </p>
<p>By 5:45 everyone was here... Akane, Bryn, Mirei, and Riku (who had gone out for the little drive home to pick up his mom and sister), Susan, Kevin, and Amelia, and then Brent and Mari. </p>
<p>Mirei smiled at everyone... Kevin entertained her for a while, Susan held her, and the rest of us enjoyed her sweet personality, but soon she was tired and cried harder than any of us have ever heard her; I'm sure it didn't help that there was lots of noise, attention, and light everywhere. We all took turns trying to soothe her, and finally Akane managed to, nursing in a dark bedroom. Akane joined us for cheesecake, Amelia had a bath, and Riku and the children played in the hallway with the train. Busy, busy day, but it was lots of fun. </p>
<p>Everyone left around 8:15 p.m. Caillie's throat was still quite sore,  so she gargled for the third time with salt water, and was tucked into bed by 8:45. Bryn and I played two games of "Go Fish" and he was in bed by 9:10. </p>
<p>Doug put today's photos into the online album, I cleaned up the kitchen and dining room, and finally annotated the photos. That was the end of my day; I was tired and ready for sleep when I headed up at 11 p.m. Managed to read until 11:45 though, much to my surprise.</p>
