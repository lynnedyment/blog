								<h2>Ahhh, California!</h2>
								<p>Despite the rocky start -- a late start with Riku, twenty minutes spent getting gas, an accident on the freeway (but not involving us, so there's a plus!), and a closed exit to Susan's involving a slow drive to the Golden Gate Bridge -- Riku and I finally made it to the Bay Area Discovery Museum in Sausalito, an hour and a half later than I intended being there. </p>
<p>It was such a gorgeous day, that even though Riku was a little grumbly in the car (almost drifting off at 10:30 on our commute), I decided that once he was able to run around and play in the sun he would be fine. And he was!</p>
<p>Amelia and Susan were already there, and after a little outside blackboard drawing time, the children decided to do separate activities. Amelia was anxious to do some painting inside the art area, and Riku headed off to the big climb-aboard boat, one of his favourite activities here. He clanged the bell, steered the big wheel into unknown waters, and carefully climbed in and out and around the boat, holding on to the ropes to get to the back and the front. At one point a bigger boy shoved him; Riku was in tears, and the boy was made to apologize by his mom. Riku talked about this on the way home, saying the boy was "angry" and pushed him. </p>
<p>Riku had been a little "angry" in the car himself, telling me that he didn't like -- and there followed a list of everyone in his life! -- anymore! He used a big voice to tell me that too. When I suggested he was a little tired and perhaps we should go the park instead of the museum, he made it clear that that wasn't what he wanted. At the end of our day together though, he told me he had been angry "in the morning" and said "I sorry". Apology accepted. Interesting to see that he brought it up and apologized on his own, as we hadn't discussed his anger the rest of the day. </p>
<p>Our two and a half hours there flew by! Amelia joined Riku at the big gravel pit, filling trucks and loaders, using hands and shovels. There were lots of moms and caregivers, myself included, looking like mother birds, as we popped bites of food into them during all of this action. One woman asked if I would do the same with her little guy, as it was working so well with Riku. </p>
<p>Finally though, we decided a picnic at the tables was in order, and we all ate the remainder of lunch sitting in the warm sunshine. What a day it was! I think we were going to have another temperature-breaking day, or close to it, today. Yesterday was equally beautiful. </p>
<p>One final runaround on the boat, and Amelia was ready for her nap. She seemed tired today too, so she and Susan went off, and Riku had some painting time inside as he had been promised. He stood next to a little girl who thought Riku was part of the easel, so thank goodness the paint washes out! </p>
<p>I took Riku's shoes and socks off, stripped him down to a short-sleeved T-shirt, and he was asleep by the time we were on the Golden Gate Bridge coming home. I found a lovely spot to park in Golden Gate Park, right beside a waterfall. I thought the sound would be better than the sound machine we use here at home, and it was. He napped for almost two hours, while I read, and then, since we were so close to Ocean Beach, decided that was the perfect way to end our day together. We stopped to pick up some snack supplies: a sandwich for me, fresh fruit mix for Riku, and a bag of oatmeal raisin cookies. </p>
<p>For the next two hours we sat on the beach, making (me), and breaking up (Riku) castles. Riku was happy sitting and finding lots of wet sand by digging deep down, making a road with his red plastic car, finding feathers!, and basically just enjoying the whole experience. We spent some time watching a big cruise ship going one way, and a container ship going the other, keeping an eye on the latter to ensure it really wasn't going to crash into Seal Rock. Riku always likes to know too, when we're near water, or looking at pictures of water, if there are "jelly fish in there?".</p>
<p>We sang songs all the way home. Favourites at the moment include the ever-popular "Five Little Ducks" by Raffi... with Riku sounding ever so sad when they all swim away, and then joyously grinning when they all come back! We have just relearned an old favourite of mine from years ago, about buying current buns in a baker's shop. Both Riku and Amelia like it and we sing it at least two times a day when we're together. </p>
<p>I dropped Riku off at 5:30, which was perfect timing as Akane had just finished up the laundry at our house. Bryn had dropped her off this morning with Mirei and they had a quiet day here together. Mirei is having some side effects from the stronger steroid and didn't sleep much last night; Akane said she made up for it today, as she slept a lot when she was here. </p>
<p>The rest of my evening flew by; I answered some emails while making a hot cup of tea and some popcorn for dinner, and then gave in to sitting and catching up on Oprah tapes, too lazy to come downstairs to get at something else. However, Doug is running out of tapes, so I justified it by solving this at least! </p>
<p>Doug and I IMed a few messages back and forth about the Grammies which he was watching in Boston, and I got through a few more emails before heading up to bed to read at 11:30 p.m.</p>
