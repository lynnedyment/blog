								<h2>Chatty Mirei and a Snuggle</h2>
								<p>Today was a busy day out and about for Doug and me. He went off for his 10 a.m. T'ai Chi class and I managed to get through lots of emails in a couple of hours before he arrived home. We both had noon appointments with the eye doctor. Good news for me; once again my long distance vision has improved and I needed to order weaker lenses for my sunglasses, now five years old. And a bonus, I still don't need reading glasses, for which I am very grateful. Partly this is due to my having small pupils which allows me to focus more clearly than I would normally be able to. Doug plans to buy new glasses in Toronto so needed to get his prescription; we each paid $35 for a new test which sees into the back of the eye, and both had good reports. </p>
<p>From there we walked in the rain to buy chocolates for Kelly and Gregg at Joseph Schmidt, running into Mari as we stood deciding that we were indeed standing where she must be living now... and we were right! She was glowing after a nice long run in the rain. </p>
<p>Lunch at a new-to-me burrito place followed. Doug discovered it while I was in Ontario, and it was delicious... we each had a burrito with smoked tofu, pineapple, mushrooms, rice, and peanut sauce... a Thai burrito! I didn't even save half for tomorrow, and it was a bargain at $5.25. It really hit the spot and I will be back.</p>
<p>From there we hit Costco, Rainbow, Trader Joe's and Safeway before finally arriving at home around 5 p.m. I didn't need any dinner, and Doug had a bowl of barley soup with added goodies in it; nice for me as it only needed heating up. </p>
<p>We both got busy on the computers and hadn't been working long when Bryn called to see if we would like to have Mirei here for a visit while they went out for a noodle dinner with Riku. Oh yes! She had been nursed, and was awake when they brought her over; such a treat! She was awake longer tonight than she has been ever; she looked at all the bright folk art chickens in the living room, stared at the same light over our bed that always fascinated Riku, took full notice of the black and white cat in Riku's room from Auntie Kelly and Uncle Gregg, and paid notice to the hanging mobiles in his room too. But the best part of all was all the chatting she did! Lots of oohs, and ahhhs, and exchanges of sounds lobbed to and fro from us. Mirei just smiles the biggest smiles and it is such fun to see! Finally, after all this excitement she was exhausted and needed some cuddling to get to sleep. I placed her in the chair in the living room and read while watching her peacefully sleeping. She awoke just as her family came in. </p>
<p>I thought Bryn would just scoop Mirei up and dash home, but they all came up after Riku had asked if I could read him a story. Perfect timing, as Susan had given me a book about "Baby Beluga" with all the words from the main verse and chorus, and Riku was delighted with it. When Bryn told him it was time to go home, he protested, saying "I just want to snuggle with Nana". Doug was watching "Corpse Bride" while I was downstairs with Mirei, so we snuggled while Riku watched a few minutes of that. He is a snuggly boy for sure, and really wriggles into a nice snuggling position! They went off home shortly after that, with the DVD in hand to watch in the morning. </p>
<p>Doug and I decided to watch the last half of a music documentary we had started to watch a couple of nights ago, but I drifted off while Doug gave me a much needed back rub. Twas lovely! </p>
<p>More emails and then early to bed... about 10 a.m. as 4:30 a.m. will come early. Doug is flying to Toronto at 6 a.m.</p>
