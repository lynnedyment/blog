								<h2>Amelia and Friends</h2>
								<p>I had sent Susan an email last night, wondering if Amelia could come over after nursery school today. Chatted with Susan early, and was happy to learn that it was going to work out. </p>
<p>Spent the morning catching up on emails, and getting a few cards ready to send out for next month. My mornings pass by quickly, filled with lots of little chores in the house. </p>
<p>However, I was out the door at 12:15 to pick up Amelia. She burst into tears when she saw me; I had been warned by Susan that she was tired, so knew she was expecting her mom or at least disappointed that I wasn't her. However, by the time we walked outside the school to the car, she was her amiable little self, and ready to talk about what story we would read at home, after her snack, and before her nap. </p>
<p>Well, the nap never actually happened today. I thought it might have, and wondered at times if it had, but finally had to admit defeat. Amelia settled in so nicely, burrowing down into the duvet, breathing heavily (always a good sign), but the minute I turned to leave the room, she was objecting to needing to nap. I settled her in again, singing, rubbing her forehead, until I heard her taking those nice deep breaths, letting me believe she was asleep. Nope! We went through the whole routine again, with Amelia insisting this time that she was all ready to wake up! And once more, I tucked her in, settled her down, she cried for two minutes and then all was silent. I had the monitor on, and couldn't hear a thing. Twenty minutes later she called out, I went in to find she had a dirty diaper... a good reason for not falling asleep... and had obviously spent lots of time moving dozens of books from the bedside table to the bed! I couldn't believe how quietly she did this. Of course, once I got the diaper changed, Amelia was all ready with her story about having had a good sleep, and telling me it was time to get up now. This time I snuggled in next to her, and spent fifteen minutes watching her watch me, so up we got! I knew she was tired but she was not going to give in. </p>
<p>Amelia played with the green Play-Doh, messed about in the little kitchen, rearranging the plates and pots and pans, and at 4 p.m. we headed out to the playground. I had called to see if Akane could bring Riku over but Bryn called to say she was on her way to Ivonne's and Diego's. Too bad. However, Amelia was just delighted to see her friend from daycare (actually, <strong>the</strong> boy she has a big crush on... Alexander. He was obviously delighted to see her too, and when I asked if I could take their photo, Alexander promptly posed beside her with an arm thrown over her shoulder! There was another little boy there as well, and they were running all over the playground keeping tabs on one another. </p>
<p>At one point I looked over, and Akane, with Mirei in her Baby Bjorn front pack, Riku, Ivonne, Diego, and Mateo, in his Baby Bjorn, were just entering the playground. It was such a treat to have them all there playing together. Riku hadn't napped more than a half hour, so as he always does when he is tired, he spent more time on his own, pushing a found truck around, or sitting in the sandbox. He did join the other four children once in a while, but he seemed quite content doing his own thing too. </p>
<p>We were all there until 6 p.m. when they were locking up the gate; Susan had joined us about 5:15, bringing me a bag of food goodies from Rainbow. I peeked in and changed my mind about having soup for dinner; how she spoils me! </p>
<p>All the children were tired, so off with their mommies they went, and I drove off home on my own. I immediately decided to eat three very delicious stuffed Greek grape leaves; there is a word for these but I'm tired enough I can't think of it! I made tea and sat upstairs watching taped Oprahs, intending to watch one show and then come downstairs and get busy. I woke up at 11:30! with the tape run out and feeling chilly. Brrr. Down I came, heated up my bed buddies and off I went to bed. What a fun afternoon I had with Amelia!</p>
