								<h2>Kisses and Hugs</h2>
								<p>Hoping Amelia's cold would be a little better today, I emailed Susan last night asking if she Amelia could come over for a playdate with me today. I was delighted that she could indeed, and Susan dropped her off around 9:30 a.m. </p>
<p>We had thought of going to the playground, as Amelia had suggested it when I opened the door to her this morning, but our three hours flew by at home. What kept us busy? Sifting flour and soda for the gingerbread dough Riku and I started a couple of days ago, mixing it up with our hands, which Amelia just loved, squeezing and kneeding away like an old pro. She also "washed up", splashing about in the largest bowl with soap and bubbles, using the cloth to clean the spoons and measuring cups, etc; she did a great job!  Then it was time to pedal Riku's tricycle around the house and she managed to use the pedals for a few turns. Mostly though she liked to push with her feet.</p>
<p>Once she had finished up her second breakfast from home, we went outside and gardened; the sun was warm and the garden needed attention. Amelia was such a good little helper and pulled weeds, helped put the leaves in the bag, and watered the plants with many refills of the elephant watering can. She was just adorable with a pink satin ribbon in her hair, looking very dainty, but taking the gardening very seriously... broom over her shoulder like an old pro', really pulling out the weeds with vigour! and enjoying her little cracker snacks outside on the little stool. What a sweetheart this little girl is. </p>
<p>I showed her the falling girl on the computer and it intrigued her as much as it did Riku last week. Uncle Frank sent it on to us, and they watch the girl falling over and over onto big bubbles and then we get to rescue her when she gets stuck. While she did this I plied her with her fruit mixture from Susan, bananas and apple slices. </p>
<p>She played with the green Play-Doh, her number one choice of colour each time, while I fed her a little "lunch"... she wasn't hungry but ate a half a waffle with maple syrup and butter, and drank almost a whole container of orange juice. While she was sitting there, she looked over at me and said "I love you <strong>so</strong> much Nana!" and gave me a big hug. I enjoyed my time with her so much; it really did fly by. </p>
<p>Susan was waiting for her at 12:50 when I pulled up to the house; of course she had goodies for me... a sheet of the new children's book stamps and new Crayola twistable pencils for the children's "art" table.</p>
<p>Riku came running out, with a big happy face as usual, when I picked him up from school, and we had a merry ol' time singing on the way home. I had been singing "She'll be Coming 'Round the Mountain" to Amelia, which delighted her, as her mommy sings it to her, but it was new for Riku and he wanted to sing it many times. I could see he was close to drifting off, so I opened the windows and sang away and we made it almost all the way home, within two blocks, before he gave in to sleep. He had only napped a half hour yesterday after Akane picked him up in the stroller, so he was more than ready to catch up today. </p>
<p>We had a pretty sad forty minutes, as he cried when I took him out of the car and then reacted with anger until I finally settled him down for what turned out to be a more than two and a half hour nap. I wasn't at all surprised, and even when he woke after that point, I opened his door and told him he could join me in the kitchen... and he stayed in bed for another fifteen minutes. When I went in to get him, he wanted to be wrapped in his special blanket and cuddled for about fifteen minutes. Poor sweet baboo. </p>
<p>I was rolling gingerbread during the end of his nap time, and he ate a warm cookie fresh from the oven, before agreeing to get dressed. His first request was that we play together on the bed with his cars, so we did that, which is where his dad found us when he arrived at 5:15. Riku wasn't at all ready to go home, he wanted to play with his animals in the sink first, so Bryn suggested that he stay over with me tonight. He had work he wanted to do and so we did this. Riku played with his animals for the longest time, chatting away to himself all the while. I went back to rolling out the cookies and he watched me put the eyes, buttons, belt, and arms and legs on them, before suggesting they needed noses. Noses added. </p>
<p>He pieced away at his "snack" tray, which hadn't interested him when he first woke up... two cookies did though, so I fed him strawberries, bananas, thin carrot sticks, cherry tomatoes, and Canadian cheddar cheese sticks while he played. He likes the old cheddar very much, which pleases me no end! </p>
<p>Bath time followed; tonight for the first time he asked me for his "safe cloth", for his eyes before I washed his hair. Bryn had told me about this term, and it is just too clever; it is certainly a safe way to wash his hair and keep the water/shampoo out. </p>
<p>He always puts all his bath toys in the tub, which means it's pretty darned crowded in there. Tonight he was putting the alphabet letters on the side of the tub, and found all the letters for his name. Just for fun I put them in the wrong order, and then pronounced them the way they were; he laughed so hard as RIKU became KURI or URKI. It was hilarious and we spend several minutes at it.  </p>
<p>There was enough time for Riku to do some drawing, using the new pencil crayons from Auntie Susan, and we sang along with Raffi for most of the evening. He ate a small bowl of oatmeal with blueberries, and drank two cups of his current favourite juice... mango, orange, and carrot. </p>
<p>Just after that, on a whim, I acted out blowing bubbles and Riku realized what I was doing. He pretended he was driving a car and was delighted when I guessed it. From there I went to blowing up a balloon and then decided to get out a real one. What fun we had; I showed him how to make it squeal, then he tried, and also tried to blow it up himself. He managed to do so, but then sucked the air back down! We blew it up several times and then let it blow madly about the kitchen, which made him laugh out loud once more. </p>
<p>After that he made me a quick "dinner", all veggies on a green plate, with a green fork, knife, and spoon carefully placed beside the plate. What a guy! At 8:10 it was tuck-in time.  </p>
<p>We read "Baby Beluga" from Auntie Susan, and while I was lying down beside him he asked if we were "cuddled up snug" in our bed. During the snuggling time he leaned over three times and kissed me soundly on the cheek. He also apologized for knocking over the lamp on his bedside table when he was angry. This is the second time he has apologized for something which had happened earlier in the day, and which hadn't been mentioned since the incident. </p>
<p>... and that's it. I shall finish with a comment from Bryn today. When he took Riku into the school this morning, Riku, as usual, chose his stickers for his daily record book. Today he chose two 2s, and put them in the right box for the 22nd of February, neatly side by side</p>
<p>He just woke at 11:15 with a bad dream about "ebi", shrimp in English, but settled back down immediately with just a little stroke on his wrist. However, it is bedtime for me... night night.</p>
