								<h2>Happy Birthday Mykayla! and Another Hundred Kisses</h2>
								<p>Riku woke up at 6:20 this morning; he tried hard to fall asleep again, and I tried hard to help him get there too, but eventually he kissed my nose, and then told me he was going to kiss me one hundred times! What a sweet boy he is. Of course, I started to laugh just as he does when I tell him this, as it tickles him, and so our day began. </p>
<p>He wanted some "nest" time, but mostly he wanted to cuddle a bit before getting out of the warm bed. I turned on the heat and dressed him pretty quickly, as the house was cold! Brrr! </p>
<p>I couldn't feed him enough today. He started off with a half banana and some fresh strawberries at 7 a.m. with some apple juice, and by 9 a.m. had finished an adult-sized portion of nine-grain hot cereal with blueberries. When I was sitting eating my fried egg and toast at 10:30 a.m. he asked where his was, after I had dipped his slice of toast into my egg yolk. He ate his own fried egg, two slices of "bacon" and almost a second slice of toast. That little tummy of his was big and round! </p>
<p>Riku said he wanted "privacy" in the bathroom this morning, as he did yesterday as well. I shut the door and listen for the flushing before going in to attend to the parts he can't manage on his own yet, which includes getting off the toilet! </p>
<p>This morning we made a cave and a small house out of Play-Doh, and sat for a long time pretending there were a bear and two cubs in the cave, and people in the house. No toilet paper today, thank goodness, as I am much better at figuring out what bears and people do, than toilet paper! </p>
<p>We watched Caillou together this morning, and Riku decided, after seeing Caillou and his grandmother make cookies, that he should make cookies for his daddy, as Caillou had. The intention was to bake some brownies, as they would be faster than cookie baking, but my eye caught a recipe for a lemon loaf and we made that instead. We had picked two fresh lemons from the Meyer lemon tree on the boulevard across the street so it seemed a perfect way to use them up. </p>
<p>What a treat this was; I must do it more often with both Amelia and Riku. Riku enjoyed every aspect of the whole experience... from spinning the plastic turnaround on the mixer (while I melted the butter), to adding the last drop of milk at the end of the process. I think his favourite part of all, though, was sliding the kitchen knife across the top of the cup to level the flour. His eyes just lit up, although he sure liked helping me sift the flour, baking powder, and salt too! He took it all quite seriously, and helped me with each step of it, right to the pouring and scraping of the batter into the pan. Perhaps he will be a chef when he grows up. </p>
<p>While the cake baked, Riku and I watched the men working on the roof next door, pouring down the old shingles and tarpaper into a huge funnel. Riku craned his neck so he could see the men on the roof and watch the man in the truck wielding his shovel after it all piled up. He did a little drawing, using the big smooth crayons-in-a-roll stick that Kelly sent home for the children. They both like them a lot although it changes the way that Riku draws as it allows him to fill in a huge area very quickly. No more tiny and very precise little patterns; we are into a whole new art form now! </p>
<p>While the cake was cooling, an hour later, Riku helped me poke holes into the top of the cake so that we could pour the lemon juice and sugar over the top. It was too hot to take home with him, but Bryn picked it up after work tonight. It tasted pretty good to me (I sliced one thin slice off the end of it); I hope they like it on Hampshire Street too. </p>
<p>Riku was to spend the day at home today as we are back to our Monday, <br />
Wednesday, Friday routine with him. I thought we would start back next week but Bryn insisted that we do so this week, so off we went at 11 a.m.</p>
<p>It was hot outside! I had tossed on a light jacket and Riku had a sweater on over his T-shirt but neither of us needed the extra layer. It was like a spring day out there today! Bryn told me later that he and Ted had gone for a walk on their lunch hour, as it was so gorgeous. This was an Ocean Beach day for sure, and I won't be surprised if I hear that Amelia and Susan were there after naptime today. Riku meandered home, in his relaxed ambling way, checking out all the sights along the way. Today we saw a bomb squad car; that makes two in one week! </p>
<p>We arrived at his home a half hour later(!) in time to see Mirei sound asleep in her mommy's arms. Akane told me that Mirei is having trouble settling into sleep and doesn't sleep soundly, a probable result of the side-effect of the stronger steroid she is now on. Poor wee girl. She is a bonny baby, and looked so content when I was there. Akane thinks she is probably weighing close to twelve pounds now! I managed to put her into her little seat while Akane had a few minutes with Riku, but apparently she woke up immediately after I left. </p>
<p>I strolled home, enjoying the warm and sunny day, but got right to work on the paper work taking up too much space on the kitchen counter... still! Worked my way through more than half of that, made some phone calls, napped on the sofa for a half hour after finishing the wonderful Joan Didion book, talked to Myk' and sang "Happy Birthday" to her... twelve today!, made myself a big bowl of soup for my dinner, went through over a hundred and twenty-five emails, talked to Glenna, and to Bryn when he came to pick up his mail and the loaf. He spent a few minutes with some suggestions about getting cheaper car and house insurance, and went home to his busy little family. </p>
<p>Bed time now... 11 p.m. Productive day, but I hope to be up in the morning getting even more done tomorrow!</p>
