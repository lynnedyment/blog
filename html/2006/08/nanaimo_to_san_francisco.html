								<h2>Nanaimo to San Francisco</h2>
								<p>Well, today is the day to head home again. It has been a lovely, busy fun-filled week with Gail and Tom, but all good things must come to an end. Riku slept in until 7:45 today; I had been lying there for a while but finally got up to shower and get the last-minute things packed up. Riku was a little out of sorts, with not quite enough sleep under his belt for such a busy morning. He sat and watched the first Stuart Little while eating a banana, his cereal, and apple juice. I finished the bit of packing, and put together a little extra food for him for the ferry: two scrambled eggs, toast, and an orange. Gail had packed up cheese, veggies, and fruit for us last night, but we both forgot to get it out of the fridge! </p>
<p>We left the house at 9:05, just five minutes later than planned. I had asked Tom to make the reservation for guaranteed loading on the 10:15 ferry out of Duke's Point, as things were filling up fast. We made it there in lots of time, and as soon as we were onboard Tom and I lined up for breakfast while Gail and Riku got seats in the dining area for us. When we returned with eggs, toast, hash browns, and tea, Riku was sitting happily working on a new picture, in reds and purple. </p>
<p>We sat there for quite a while and then Uncle Tom took him up on the top deck to see the water; it was far too windy today for him and for the next hour he was most happy playing in the play area with many other children. He drank an entire bottle of orange juice as he played and before we knew it we were landing. Riku was sound asleep two minutes after the car got moving, the half hour not nearly enough to make up for the lost hour last night. </p>
<p>We had a little time at the airport; I found a Vancouver t-shirt for Riku, went through to claim a GST refund, and the time before getting through the security area came too quickly. I had two full baggage carts, both quite heavy, and Riku insisted, once Gail and Tom had to say goodbye, on helping me push one of them, on his own! He pushed and  maneuvered to the best of his ability, but a very kind woman offered her assistance. Riku insisted on doing it on his own, but a little gentle guidance from her made the turns a little easier. At one point Riku allowed her to push it while he pulled it from the front; what a trooper! He really was a big help, and I would have had a lot more trouble if he hadn't been doing his best to help.  </p>
<p>Our flight was at 2:45; we got to the gate, after a bathroom stop, just as they were loading, but took the time for Riku to have one slide down in the children's play area. We could easily have put in a half hour there but without knowing about it, I tried to avoid just sitting around before the flight. </p>
<p>Off we went, with Riku handing in his ticket, being a little concerned that they didn't tear off the one end of it as I had told him they would, and then finally asking one of the attendents to do this. And, the best part of all was that he was invited to go into the cockpit and see all the lights and meet the captain and first officer! They lit up the lights for him, and were so wonderful with him; Riku was just grinning from ear to ear. </p>
<p>Riku had a window seat, I had the middle, and we had a very quiet man sitting on the aisle, working away with papers and reading a book. Riku has to be the perfect flight companion! He settled in immediately, got the seat belt on, listened to the announcements and asked questions about them, and once we were in the air took out the emergency instruction manual and sat "reading" it over very carefully several times. He pointed out to me that we couldn't smoke, couldn't take our luggage with us, and then asked about the little drawings of fire and water and the emergency ramp. Bryn told me they had gone over this on the flight to and from Japan as well, so he has it well memorized. The rest of the trip went amazingly well; Riku looked at books, he drew for a while with his markers, we talked about "old people with spots on their faces" (his visit to Etta's residence the other day obviously triggered this comment), and he sat on my lap and watched a bit of "Wallace and Grommet", although the lighting wasn't that good. When we first sat down he asked "Where is <strong>my</strong> TV?" and told me what he had watched on the trip from Japan... although I have forgotten now what it was. He liked it though! He had a glass of apple juice, ate a few goldfish crackers and was perfectly happy sitting there for the entire flight. We landed at 4:59 P.M., right on time. it was a long walk to the area where we were being met by his parents and sister, but the second he spotted them, I told him he could run ahead, and run he did... straight for Mirei! He was so excited to see her and by the time I got there he had given her several hugs and kisses, eliciting many smiles from others waiting for passengers. It was the sweetest thing, and Mirei just added to it with her big beaming smiles at us. </p>
<p>I sat on the floor with Mirei while Bryn looked after the luggage. Riku was bouncing back and forth from talking to Bryn, joining Akane and me, and continuing to kiss his sister and talk to her. Oh my! How he loves her and how he shows it too. He so obviously missed her. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped me at home at 5:40, just as Doug had left for his T'ai Chi class. I had an hour and a half on my own, got my carryon bag sorted out, checked my emails briefly -- too many to even think about right now -- and then called Gail's (leaving them a "thank you" message), and Uncle Frank, whom I had neglected while away. We chatted for a whole hour, and I waved at Doug when he came walking in with his dinner burrito. It was lovely catching up on Uncle Frank's news and there was lots of it; he has learned to make devilled eggs, has a new corn-on-the-cob holder and cooker, and is being kept busy with his physio. </p>
<p>The rest of the evening I deleted emails, did more unpacking, sat and read today's paper, and went off to bed at 11 o'clock. Doug had been working flat out all week so he was glad to get to bed before midnight for a change.</p>
