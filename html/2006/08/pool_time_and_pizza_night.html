								<h2>Pool Time and Pizza Night!</h2>
								<p>Doug went off to his T'ai Chi lesson, the official last day of the beginner's class. From now on, they are considered to have a basic understanding of the form, and for the rest of their lives will be refining this form. Quite an accomplishment, and Doug is enjoying it very much! </p>
<p>Bryn called to say that he was coming over with the children to do the laundry while Akane spent some time on her own at the studio. It is getting harder for Mirei to be happy there for long anymore; she wants to move more and have more attention paid to her too! Not long after they arrived, Kevin called to see if he and Amelia could come over too, for some pool time. It is already heating up in the city, and our place is sunny in the back yard but cool in the house. He and Bryn got busy pumping the pool up and then giving it a good cleaning as well. Meanwhile, I got to watch Mirei roll around in the living room and inspect all her soft toys. Amelia and Riku were helping out with the pool and I gathered up some tub toys to add to it. The water was cold but the children were happy to run in and out of it anyway. Amelia was wearing a sweet little polka dot bathing suit she bought in Alaska, and Riku was wearing his Hawaiian shorts, almost too small for him. </p>
<p>Mirei was a tired girl, rubbing her eyes, and without realizing Bryn had a bottle for her, I successfully fed her from a drinking glass, with pumped breast milk from the freezer! I was amazed at how well she did, but Bryn said they have been giving her sips of water for some time now. Bryn also started feeding her solid foods last week. She had had her first taste of it before leaving for Japan, but was back on liquids during that busy time. Now she has had nori and cereal and Bryn says she ate a huge bowl of it after it was made up with too much liquid. Oh yes, this little girl likes to eat! </p>
<p>I just held her in my arms, cradling her, singing to her, and slowly swaying with her. She was asleep with five minutes and I successfully lay her down in the front bedroom, "nesting" her with four pillows as I still do with Amelia and Riku. It worked and she slept for one hour and forty-five minutes! </p>
<p>Ours was a busy house, it was! The dads kept an eye on the children, Kevin and I took some photos, the children had yogurt and toasted whole wheat bagels for their lunch outside, and by the time it was close to nap time I had them bundled up in warm towels as they negotiated for more time together. They're pro's at it! First they cuddled up on the twin beds, with Amelia's arms around Riku's neck, snuggling up and covering themselves with the soft blanket I had used for Mirei. They both closed their eyes as though they were really going to go to sleep. Hah! And then it was a trip to the bathroom for Riku, "just two minutes" for some playtime upstairs with the Lego, and another two minutes for something else. Finally, the ploy was up, we waved goodbye to Kevin and Amelia (Kevin kindly emptied the pool and cleaned up while we were having our extra time inside), and Riku was asleep within seven minutes. </p>
<p>He napped for one hour and forty-five minutes as well, running happily out of his room without calling out for me to cuddle him... most unusual but just how I want him to waken. Bryn had taken Mirei to the studio to be nursed, and stayed there with her until it was time to get Riku after his nap. Riku had a little snack of cheese and grapes, a little drawing time, and off he went home with his family for just forty-five minutes before we planned to leave for our usual Saturday night pizza night out. I had continued with the laundry and had it done, but for one load, before we left at 5 P.M. </p>
<p>Dinner was delicious! We went to "Patxi's" in Hayes Valley; it is a fairly small place but they put two tables together for us, a sleeping Mirei was in her car seat on the floor, and Riku happily sat drawing while we waited for our deep dish pie. We shared a salad while we waited, and Riku and his parents nibbled on carrot sticks Akane had brought along. We had a very friendly waitress taking care of us, the pizza was delicious... Riku ate a whole slice of his own, and we enjoyed it very much. </p>
<p>Riku asked his dad "What are we going to do after pizza?" and since there was a new-to-us playground just around the corner, one we spot when we drive to his school, we all trooped over there for some "exercise". Riku talks a lot about exercise these days; we have been discussing healthy foods and keeping our muscles strong and building big muscles by climbing, running, and moving around. He told Bryn the other day that he had strong elbows! So, we ran and chased and climbed and got our heart rates up, while Mirei sat pulling on a blade of grass and being perfectly happy for the longest time. </p>
<p>Riku left with the promise of a tricycle ride on his street, while Doug and I came home for some computer time. I made tea and took it upstairs while watching some taped Oprah shows; Doug has run out of tapes, since I have been away so much. A lot of them are repeats so I managed to get through two of them, and cross that "job" off my mental list. I fell asleep after 11 P.M. though, came downstairs to check emails, and finally went to sleep after reading far too late... it was after 1 A.M.! Arggh! Must get to bed earlier tomorrow night!</p>
