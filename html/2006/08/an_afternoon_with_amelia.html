								<h2>An Afternoon with Amelia</h2>
								<p>As my time for flying off to Ottawa comes closer, my days just zoom by faster than ever. I have no idea what happened to my morning, although Doug and I did run an errand, to pick up some free coffee, beignet mixes, and coffee mugs... all offered on freecycle, the amazing "sharing" of goodies no longer wanted by subscribers. The gal who had offered them was super-friendly and helped me carry the five gift baskets down from her office. On the way home, we stopped in Noe Valley; I had my hair cut and Doug poked around the record stores. Back home, I found a message from Susan saying Amelia was expecting me to pick her up after all; she wasn't at all sure about this last night. </p>
<p>Amelia was obviously tired when I arrived at her nursery school at 12:20, and was a little sad that her mom wasn't there to pick her up. However, that lasted all of two minutes until we started talking about what books we would read at nap time. I told her about my "Everyday Story Book" we haven't read before, and she decided on "Skippy", the lost dog story. All went well... the timer was set for five minutes of playing before tuck-in, Amelia liked the story a lot, tut-tutting at the poor dog's situation in the cold, dark house, and we cuddled up for her drifting off time... except she didn't drift off! There was a problem toe nail to work on, and then a fingernail inspection, and different positions for her baby snowman to sleep in, etc., etc. After forty minutes of lying with her, it was obvious sleep was not imminent and so up she got, telling me she had a little cold... and sure enough, her nose was running. </p>
<p>She was a busy girl after that; she worked with two different colours of Play-Doh, strutted around with the chicken tea cozy on her head, chatted a bit with Doug, who was cleaning up a few odds and ends from last night's deadline, but took the time to show us how to email a drawing she made on the computer "to Auntie Gail" at Amelia's request. We copied it to her mom too, as it was very colourful and lively, and now it's on its way to Oma in Victoria, via slow mail. Susan printed it up for her. </p>
<p><br />
At 2:45, at Susan's suggestion, I tried once again to tuck Amelia in for her nap; otherwise it was going to be a very tired girl that her daddy picked up later on. She had ten minutes on the timer, and used it to play upstairs by herself, but, as promised, came right downstairs when called and despite saying she still wasn't tired, those big green-blue eyes said otherwise. She didn't take seven minutes to settle this time 'round, and slept for an hour and thirty-five minutes. Perfect! </p>
<p>This gave us time for snacks (toast and cheese) and another story from my book, plus one of her very all time favourite activities... pushing the bee on the stick around and around the house. Kevin called at 5:25 to say he was on his way over, and we were outside walking up and down the sidewalk when he arrived not ten minutes later. We were looking for the cat across the street, but had no such luck. </p>
<p>Doug was off to T'ai Chi and a "graduation" dinner with his teacher and classmates tonight, so I had a few hours on my own at home. First I made a hot cup of tea, and sat in the living room reading a new Canadian novel I received for my birthday, dragging out the tea as long as possible, and then got to work, tidying and dusting each room and finally vacuuming this floor. I cleared out a large number of stacks of Doug's that had been put away for my birthday party, and now hope that Doug will have time, while I'm away, to find room for them. We are out of book space! I think I said that last night... </p>
<p>I got lots done today, despite it being busy for most of the daylight hours; looks like I might be organized in time for Wednesday after all! Oh, I did some IM-ing with Kelly and Brynnie tonight too... a nice surprise as they have been away a lot this summer. Spoke with Riku on the phone tonight as well, telling him our plans with Auntie Susan and Amelia tomorrow. More about that... tomorrow!</p>
