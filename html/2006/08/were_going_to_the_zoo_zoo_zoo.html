								<h2>"We're Going to the Zoo, Zoo, Zoo... "</h2>
								<p>.. and so we did! Riku and I have been singing this song for a week or so and today was the day. I picked him up at 9:40 and we arrived after a short wrong turn -- as always(!) when I try to go the shortest way -- at 10:15. We started off at the giraffe and zebra exhibits, went on to see the lemurs, and stopped by the meerkats and gophers. Riku ran through his favourite tunnel, hiding on the side "shelf", and we were at the petting zoo at 11 A.M. to meet up with Susan and Amelia. </p>
<p>Amelia had slept until 9 o'clock this morning, still not quite in sync' after her trip to Alaska; it meant she missed her last gymnastics class, but at 11:15 we were together for a couple of hours. They flew by as always, with time in the "barnyard" with the sheep and goats, although Riku was far more interested in raking the ground than almost anything else. He even managed to find an extra rake for Amelia, and she kindly shared her kibble food so that he too could feed some of the less agressive goats. </p>
<p>Riku did his usual collecting of sticks on our way to a couple of other exhibits. We saw parrots and some monkeys, but Riku was tired, and it was lunch time before long. We sat inside today, at a very crowded cafe, and had lunch together. </p>
<p>Susan bought teriyaki salmon and kindly shared it with me, Amelia had fish & chips and some of Riku's fruit, and he ate all his egg and almost all of his fruit as well. He helped drink Amelia's orange juice earlier too; she kindly "fed" it to him as they sat in the rented wagon, although both children spent more time out of it then in. I ate half of the delicious tofu muffaletta sandwich Bryn bought for us yesterday, and shall eat the other half tomorrow. </p>
<p>The zoo is very close to the section of Ocean Beach where we always play, and as I knew would happen, Riku was asleep in the car by the time we got there. I sat and read until the forty minute mark, when Riku almost always "stirs", and then drove through Golden Gate park, finding another cool spot to sit in until he awoke at the hour and a half mark. We were very close to a playground we seldom go to, and Riku was keen to play outside; this worked very well. He had fun running around on the play structures, down the slides and up the ladders, and found a couple of boys to sit in the sandbox with and play when he was tired from running about. We left at 4:30, just as everyone else was heading home as well. </p>
<p>Home for dinner; Riku got busy "cooking" for us while I prepared ours. He was so verbal and so busy with it, asking if Doug would like tea, did he want the blue cup or the red one, did I want a handle on my cup, I didn't want sugar in it, right? and on it went. Doug was shaking his head at all of this outpouring of details. But, in the midst of it, he set the table so nicely with cups and plates, glasses, and food for us, while I quickly made Riku a bowl of noodles with lots of veggies in it; he ate every bite of it. Doug and I shared a commercial pizza and a plate of vegies, Riku had custard and more grapes for dessert a little later on, but the best part of the evening was Riku cleaning out my "extra bags" cupboard. It has been overflowing for ages, and I asked Riku if he would do a job for me. He immediately said "yes", and  then asked what it was. I had him pull our all of the bags, and asked him to sort them into plastic and paper piles. There were literally hundreds of both and he did an astounding job of it! Doug and I told him so too. </p>
<p>As he was sitting drawing, Riku piped up with a comment I have never heard from him before... "I'm worried." I asked him, of course, what he was worried about and he said that he worried that his daddy hadn't said hello to him today, or goodnight to him yet. So I called Bryn and Riku told him his story; Bryn, of course, planned to come over before ping-pong to say goodnight to him, as he almost always does, but it was interesting to hear Riku come up with this thought. I think he is trying out his new words. </p>
<p>I find he is quite impulsive with his hugs and kisses lately. I was sitting on the sofa reading, with a cup of tea nearby, and Riku came running in from his "work" at the "studio" to hug me and tell me he loves me. It's pretty darned sweet to hear him say goodbye on the phone the way we Dyments and Rodgers do, ending each conversation with "buh bye; I love you", and ending with a big smack of a kiss. Amelia is doing the same thing too and it makes my heart melt to hear it from these little ones. Both of them always run to wave goodbye from the window too, as parents leave. We have done this since Kelly and Bryn were little, and we have always been lucky enough to have a window with access making this possible. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped in just as Riku was eating his dessert; they had a little time together, and then it was PJ, teeth, and tuck-in time for Riku. We read "Olivia" tonight for the first time, a loaner from Amelia, who is a big Olivia fan. Riku enjoyed it too, and looked very carefully at each of the darling drawings, mostly black and white with some red highlights. Bryn dropped in to say goodnight to him just as he was finishing up. </p>
<p>I had to package up the bags, clean up after dinner and our outing today, and was tired enough that I went to bed at 10:30... no reading, just right to bed.</p>
