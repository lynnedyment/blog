								<h2>Monday Already...</h2>
								<p>Egad! I leave for Ontario in just two days; hardly seems possible! Bryn dropped Riku off for me this morning on his way to work, and there was time for only three minutes of Caillou. Riku was disappointed, as he likes the show so much and doesn't get to see it very often. However, he watched "Old Bear" with Grandpa while I had my shower and put away the laundry, all done up for the trip. </p>
<p>Quiet morning at home... read some stories, ate breakfast together, Riku made me quite an elaborate "breakfast" too, and insisted that I eat the egg and rice before eating the fruit. That, along with an ice cream cone, was my dessert. Riku is asking some tough questions these days... "What is mind?".... and told me tonight "I just thinking about something; I was thinking about trains, and school, and many many things!" He also did a lot of role-playing, which was very interesting; he pretended he was angry with me, and then wanted me to pretend to be angry with him. We frowned at each other, apologized to each other, and talked about being angry. I forgot to mention yesterday that he asked, "What are dreams?" and seemed satisfied with my answer that they are pictures that come to your mind when you are sleeping. Perhaps that is what prompted the "What is mind" question tonight. </p>
<p>I called Uncle Frank this morning to see how he was feeling, and had a chance to talk with Neal too. I also got some photos of the trip to B.C. annotated this morning, although have a lot to do still. </p>
<p>Doug had to go to Toys R Us to buy some dominoes for a training session tomorrow, so we went along for the ride. This was lots of fun for Riku, as he wandered up and down the aisles, stopping to inspect anything that caught his eye... a rubber sword, big plastic fish, power figures, too many things in packaging for his liking(!) but did he love the wandering about! It's great that he doesn't ask for anything, although mentioned he would like the sword. I bought some paint for him to replace the colours in his little pots, although he didn't know that until we got home. </p>
<p>We went to a Target store too, and he and Grandpa walked around looking at a few things while I did a bit of shopping for Caillie's and Bryn's upcoming birthdays. He was very interested in the DVDs and spotted "Corpse Bride" immediately, telling me it wasn't really very scary, just a little bit. </p>
<p>We stopped at a Taco Bell for a bite to eat in the car on the way home; Riku enjoyed a cheese quesadilla and was happy to learn from Grandpa that this was a Spanish word. Riku said tonight that he knows lots of Japanese words, lots of English words, and a few Spanish words. He demonstrated by saying "buenos dias" and repeating "quesadilla". And to think he might be learning to speak Chinese in another year! </p>
<p>I read a couple of stories to Riku in the car while he ate, and then he napped in the car on the way home. Doug stopped on the street; I was in the back seat with Riku and read and dozed a bit myself! We had a pretty mellow late afternoon at home; he wandered in and out of the back yard for a while, painted and rediscovered that blue and yellow mixed together make green. Next on the agenda was "painting" on the computer, using the Jackson Pollock site that Uncle Frank sent us last week. Amelia has been enjoying that site too, and Susan sent a lovely e-photo today of her working away at it at home, in her PJs. </p>
<p>Doug went off for his T'ai Chi class, and Riku and I played a couple of games of matching the cards, and he played with dominoes on his own while I cooked up some noodles and veggies. After his bath time, with the smallest number of items in the tub ever in his life(!) -- just three: the big BC ferry boat, a smaller motor boat, and a plastic container to use for washing them. Cleanup was a breeze tonight! </p>
<p>In the tub, Riku said, "I'm sad. I don't know if Daddy will call me to say goodnight." This is twice this week I have heard this from him, and I really think he is learning to speak about his feelings. It came right out of the blue and then he went back to playing. A half hour later Bryn called and they had a little chat. I realized while he was in the tub that he hadn't played with the button box for ages, so once he was out, after a lovely warm snuggle in the heated towels, he sat at the table playing with them, rediscovering all his favourites.</p>
<p>Weighed Riku before he went to bed tonight and he weighed his heaviest ever: 34.5 pounds! He has been eating so much and so frequently lately, and I noticed how roundy his cheeks looked in the tub, so it was fun to find out he really is getting bigger.  </p>
<p>Doug went off to pick up a booster car seat from our "freecycle" group and it's a beauty... a beige "suede" in wonderful condition which will replace the other. Now Mirei will have a seat when I have the two of them in the car at once. I'm expecting that will start to happen once I get back from Ontario and she is too big for her little carryon seat. </p>
<p>I IMed with Bryn for a few minutes this evening; Akane took her first Cantonese language class tonight and didn't have her pronunciation corrected once in the three hour class! Bryn said it sounds really bizarre to hear Chinese coming out of her mouth, but she is a good student and likes structure, so this will no doubt be a successful endeavour for her. </p>
<p>And that's it; time to write a couple of birthday cards for Doug to mail when I'm away. I am feeling quite prepared for this trip, although I know there is still lots I could do to leave here more caught up on things that need doing in the house. </p>
<p>Exciting news tonight from Susan and Kevin; they are expecting a baby boy in early January! Amelia is going to be a big sister, and what a good one she will be; she loves being around babies, holding them, touching them, and cooing over them, so imagine how happy she will be to have one in her own house! </p>
<p>Riku sleeping soundly in his bed; I shall be turning in shortly myself... now almost 11 P.M.</p>
