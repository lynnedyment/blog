								<h2>Sunday Already!</h2>
								<p>I spent most of the morning and afternoon today finally getting a good start on all the filing, paperwork, sorting of papers, etc. that need to be done before I leave for Ontario in just ten days! Egad! I was very efficient, cluttered up the kitchen table for hours, and accomplished so much, but not quite all, of what needs doing. </p>
<p>Bryn had called to say that they were all off for a visit with Amelia, Susan, and Kevin, would be going for a noodle lunch after that, and would I like to have Riku here for his nap. Of course! He sleeps well here and is used to the routine so it's just a matter of singing a song and closing the door behind me. They were much later than planned, though, as it was almost 2:30 when they dropped him off; the doorbell rang, and there was Riku sitting in my empty laundry basket, laughing away at me. Adorable. He told me he was hungry and wanted a "snack", so two tiny ginger cookies later, plus a bowl of custard and a glass of milk, he was ready to be tucked in. At 4 P.M., worried about him napping so late, I turned off the sound machine, opened the door, and expected to hear him up before too long. However, at 4:50 he was still asleep! I encouraged him at that point to waken, going in and moving around a little in his room. We snuggled for a bit, and a half hour later he was in the tub, playing with <strong>all</strong> his tub toys, and barely leaving enough room for him. </p>
<p>Bryn was here at 6 o'clock to pick him up for dinner so I quickly washed Riku's hair, snuggled him into his big warm blue towel, and off he went with his daddy, a hungry boy by his own admission. I made us a quick dinner here, using up more freezer items, since I am determined to not have stuff falling out of it every time I open the door! I wrote a few emails, tidied up, did a little more paper sorting and finally went upstairs with a hot cup of tea to get through a couple more taped Oprah shows. </p>
<p>And up walked Bryn with a smiling girl in his arms, ready for a quick visit with her Nana! I turned off the TV, and we sang songs, and I played peek-a-boo with Mirei, which she really liked; I even had time to read a book to her before her daddy took her off home. I first bundled her up in a snuggly sleeper of Brynnie's, though. Bryn kept telling her how adorable she looked, and she did. </p>
<p>After some computer work and yet more filing, I went back up to my shows and fell asleep watching them towards the end when it was close to midnight. Night night...</p>
