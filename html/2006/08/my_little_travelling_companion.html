								<h2>My Little Travelling Companion... SF to Nanaimo</h2>
								<p>Well, today was the big day; the very first trip alone together for Riku and me, but I hope not the last. We had a busy but relaxed morning at home, after Riku awoke at 7 A.M. His mommy, daddy, and sister came over to say goodbye about 8:15; we took a few photos of his smiling sister and waved (a foot!) out the window. Riku's and Bryn's current line is "Don't forget to put your fingers in your nose!" and so they both do, and laugh uproariously at themselves. </p>
<p>I put together a little picnic lunch for the plane, Akane had brought over inari for us as well, and the last minute packing was done in lots of time for our scheduled departure for the airport at 11:15. Grandpa stayed and waved goodbye to us while we went through the very long security line. </p>
<p>We wandered along the long hallway with a large display of seashells and ships in bottles, before heading for our gate, and found a seat near our plane so that we could watch our luggage being boarded before we did. Our time passed quickly here; Riku ate his second banana of the day and had some cheese and fruit. </p>
<p>We shared a seat with the father of a three and four year old, and he was amazed, as was I, that Riku was asleep ten minutes into the flight. He had a full tummy, lots to drink, and am empty bladder, all of which seemed to help do the trick. He just leaned against me, and slept well, while I read my book for an hour and twenty minutes, enjoying my tomato juice and pretzel snack.</p>
<p>Riku woke in time to see the plane about to begin the descent; I propped him up on a folded blanket and two pillows so he could see what was going on, and it made for a very happy boy. Our flight was from 1:05 until 3:05, a perfect time to be in the air I think. It took a long time for our bags to show up, but when we finally emerged Gail and Tom were there waiting for us. Big smiles all 'round!  </p>
<p>The drive to Tsawwassen seemed fast, although Riku must have asked ten times, between the terminals, if we could go on the boat now and play in the playroom we had told him about. So Uncle Tom took him to the little playground at the terminal while Gail and I finished up our sauteed tofu dinners (mine with rice), and a large cup of tea. </p>
<p>The playroom on board held Riku's interest for about fifteen minutes, and then he was happy to sit looking out the window at the tug boats and the islands (what gorgeous views we had!), exploring the ship with Uncle Tom, and just getting to know his Auntie Gail and Uncle Tom. He did a little drawing, looked at some books, but mostly wanted to wander about, even if it was just between all of us sitting there.  </p>
<p>It was a long day, and Riku was obviously tired by the time we reached the house just after 8:30 P.M. He spotted the new tub toys lining the big tub, and just had to have a bath; it seemed a good way to relax after a busy day and he had such a great time. The best of all possible things happened; we had told Riku he might see deer in Auntie Gail's and Uncle Tom's yard, and sure enough, just as I had him out of the tub and wrapped in a towel Gail called out two deer were on the front yard. How exciting this was for him, and they stood and watched together until they wandered across the road to the neighbours' place.</p>
<p>Gail and Tom had picked up several Robert Munsch books and did he ever laugh hard at "Aaron's Hair" when the runaway hair lands on someone's bottom! </p>
<p>His daddy called on Skype at 9 P.M., just as he was about to brush his teeth, and that done we went into his bedroom, complete with two stuffed lions on the bed. After one story, he was tucked in. Asleep at 9:30, too late... but he was happy right up to the end of his long day of travelling, and what a darling companion he was too! </p>
<p>Gail and I played cards, had tea, and then we all turned in before 11 P.M.; they had both been up early for hospital tests for Tom at 8 A.M. today and I have had a busy couple of days too.</p>
