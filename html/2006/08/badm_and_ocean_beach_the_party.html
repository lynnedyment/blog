								<h2>BADM and Ocean Beach... the Party Continues!</h2>
								<p>Well, what a wonderful first day we had at home. It is hot and sunny here in San Francisco, and I hope it continues for a few days. If Susan, Kevin, and Amelia really did have ten days of rain and clouds in Alaska it would be wonderful if the sun shone here for them; they arrive home tomorrow night, and I am hoping for some fun morning outings with them! </p>
<p>I know there is lots to do here, especially since I am heading back east in fifteen days, but I just cannot stay in and work when Riku has these mornings available to do all the things we can't do when school is in. </p>
<p>Today felt like the first day of "summer vacation" here in the city, after our trip away. So I called to see if Riku could go off to the Bay Area Discovery Museum with me; Akane put him on the phone and he said "okay", but added that he was still in his pajamas, and was busy playing with something of Mommy's that was very special and he had to be careful. </p>
<p>I told Akane I would be there as close to 9 A.M. as I could get ready and off I went to shower, pull everything out of my big suitcase, write a quick email to my sisters, and put together lunch and snacks for Riku. I was there at 9:10 to pick him up. Mirei was in a darling pink short overall set, and looked oh so sweet! Those smiles; she truly does smile all the time! I was astounded at how much red I could see in her hair. We were able to see the redness in her eyebrows long ago, but this was the first time I saw this much red in her hair! Akane says it is even more noticeable outside in the sunlight; Bryn said later it was interesting that her eyes are darker than Riku's and her hair lighter, but if she ends up being a redhead... wow! </p>
<p>Riku snacked on some "Os" in the car.. "not the yucky kind; they are all gone. These are the good kind." We were over the Golden Gate Bridge and at the museum early enough that it was easy to find a spot, and off we went to the fish stream. It won't be long before Riku is too tall for this area, and today I just let him dictate how long we would spend at each spot. Usually, I am urging him to do more things, as we don't get there often, but I'm hoping to take advantage of the mornings and get there quite frequently, even if he is home for his naps. We talked about going to the zoo as well, as it's too late to go there after his nap after school time. Riku loves the water and the fish tumbling from one spot to another, but was equally happy "rebuilding" the wonderful outdoor little house made of twigs. I wasn't. It was just too hot in that area, although we spent a good half hour there. </p>
<p>A fellow placing stones around bedding areas overheard me telling Riku I was too warm, and he suggested we head to an area behind the boats with more shade and more sticks for building up the "nests". He enjoyed that just as much, and spent quite a bit of time there before heading off to his very favourite spot... the boat. There was quite a large group of children on it today, and before I knew it Riku was running down the ramp yelling, "The boat is sinking! The boat is sinking!", following the lead of one of the older children inside the boat. They all had each other calling out orders and running in and out, out and about, for ages. </p>
<p>We had our lunch indoors where it was a little cooler, and ate early enough that we found a table to ourselves. Riku once again ate a big meal... the scrambled egg I had taken along, half of my grilled cheese sandwich, a whole orange, and then most of a big container of fruit smoothie with four fruit juices. I told him he could have ten more minutes on the boat; I could see his eyes drooping and thought an early nap was in order. He was asleep in the car before I got to the bridge entrance, about five minutes from where we were. The windows were open, the car was cool, and I parked on The Great Highway, in a shady spot, while he napped for fory-five minutes. He awoke a happy boy and asked if we were at Ocean Beach; I had driven over there once his eyes opened anticipating his going back to sleep. However, he was ready to build, so we trooped down to the water's edge with all the buckets and equipment that fit in our big beach bag, and had a grand two hours there sitting on the beach with the occasional trip to the water to fill our pails for sandcastles and roads. </p>
<p>There was an older couple sitting on chairs not too far from us, and at one point Riku strolled over to them to say hello. He introduces himself now and tells them who I am "My name is Riku. What is your name? That is my grandma over there. Her name is Nana." and on it goes. They were lovely with him, and the man played a game on Riku's hand which ended with Riku's arm in the air and being tickled. He meandered over about five or six times so they could do it again and again. </p>
<p>At 3:30 Riku suddenly spoke up and said, "I want to go to my home now. I want to see Mirei." We had had a grand time together and this was the perfect time to head off; he said his goodbyes to the couple while I packed up, we dusted all the sand we could manage off him, and sang all the way home. I taught him a new song... "I love you, I love you, said the little green man..." and he wanted to know what "my wits" were. Try explaining that one! </p>
<p>Mirei and his mommy greeted him with big smiles and hugs, I washed his face and hands to get the last of the sand off the obvious places, held Mirei and got those big smiles too, and then headed home to get something done with the rest of my day. Bur first, time for a big cup of tea and the morning paper. Then I got back to the laundry, cleared random things away from the unpacking, and made dinner while Doug went off to Safeway. We had wild salmon, corn on the cob, carrots and celery, and I polished off a bowl of spinach from the freezer.</p>
<p>Bryn IM-ed at one point that Riku was helping Akane bath Mirei in the kitchen sink; he had pulled up a stool first in the bathroom to get her a tub toy. What a guy!  </p>
<p>Computer time for a while and then the doorbell rang. It was Mirei with her daddy, who had walked her over in the stroller while Akane put Riku to bed. Mirei was ready for her bed too, but we had time to snuggle on the sofa, and floor time too for quite a while before she let her daddy know she was ready for sleep. She looked lovely in a pair of pull-on flowered pink pants and a soft pink pullover top; the short sleeves showed off her muscular and chunky little arms.</p>
<p>Bed at 11 o'clock for me; I had fallen asleep before Doug came up at midnight with the news that a terrorist plot to blow up planes had been discovered in England and now no carry-on items are being allowed on board, including books! The only exception is medication... what a world we live in. It's why we have children; they give us hope for the future.</p>
