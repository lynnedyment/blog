								<h2>A Cannon and a Water Park!</h2>
								<p>Today was a red-letter day for Riku; I think this was the best day of five great ones so far. This morning, after the usual big breakfast, some quiet drawing, time, and a much anticipated visit with Comet, we went off to the playground near the seawall. Riku ran about happily from one activity to another; it was hot here today and we were happy to seek shade in the park when he had to get to a bathroom. He found a great tree he could step inside and spent lots of time in his "bear cave". Tom had walked Comet, who wasn't any more interested in exercising in the heat than the adults, so we sat on the rocks and watched Riku beating off the bears. </p>
<p>Anticipating the cannon being shot off at noon hour, we set off to walk along the seawall to the main area closer to downtown. Gail took Riku off down a dock, and this was wonderful for him. He got to see boats up close, the sea planes docked right there, a few taking off, and a long extended dock area to explore. We arrived at the cannon just as they were preparing to go through all the steps; Riku was well prepared for them, having had "Drummer Hoff" read to him several times over the past month or so. This was just perfect; he saw the shot being placed, and the long rammer pushing it in, heard the order to fire, and then KABBOOOOM!, just like in the book! He was smiling from one ear to another as Gail held him. I got at least two great photos I hope, and Gail took one of Riku and me standing near the cannon with Riku having a good look at the two of them. </p>
<p>Home for lunch, more drawing, and then naptime; he was asleep in just minutes, before I finished singing "The Wheels on the Bus". Gail and I had one game of cards, and then she and Tom went off to Costco; I had some quiet time on my own, just reading and relaxing with a second cuppa.</p>
<p>Riku napped for what I feel is the perfect nap time for him; from 1-2:30, waking a happy little boy and ready for the rest of his day. We hung around for a bit while he had his hearty snacks... vanilla yogurt with fresh strawberries, currently his very favourite fruit, and the rest of his toast from his morning snack. </p>
<p>We had planned to go to the big water park at Parksville today, but there was a big car event on, and there was no point in battling the traffic that was sure to be there. It couldn't have been better timing, as we ended up going to a park Tom used to frequent as a child, and is now a very well-planned neighbourhood water park. What a perfect place for Riku this was!</p>
<p>There are three hoses, with very good aiming ability, with a certain limited range. Three children were using them, and at first Riku seemed hesitant about getting wet. However, once he had his chance at a turn, and got wet the first time, he was gung ho about aiming and taking hits himself. I had a turn too, and Riku found one that worked even better than mine; I was soaking wet one minute after, as I was across from his perfect aim! Gail and Tom laughed so hard but I couldn't get Gail near it to try it out and get revenge. </p>
<p>Riku really enjoyed playing in the shallow warm water created by all the other fountain areas, and eventually three other children all joined ranks collecting small sticks to float down the streams. He was such a happy little fellow paddling about in the water, not at all minding the sharp stones that I didn't like one bit. I got a good second soaking by leaning over in front of the spouts of a clown while trying to turn it on. We spent an hour and a half at this wonderful spot, and I hope we will have time tomorrow to revisit it. One of the little boys, a four-year-old, kept dunking his hat in the cold water and putting it on his head. By the time we left, Riku had dunked his head under one of the fountain streams, and was dashing under one of the large "shower" areas, loving it all. </p>
<p>Home for a tub in Gail and Tom's "spa tub". A few days ago Gail turned the jets on to see if Riku would like it, but it was somewhat loud and the jets too vigourous for his liking, but now that he is the expert at water parks, the jets were just the next step to a new exciting experience. Not only did he slide down into the water so that the bubbles were flowing furiously, but he turned a dial that made it even more agitated! One more week here and he would be a child taking on lots of new challenges I think; even at the playgrounds he is getting bolder about tackling things he wouldn't have done last week in San Francisco; he has become a much more adventurous boy. Of course birthday number four is coming up and Riku is changing in many areas, and shall continue to do so of course. </p>
<p>His vocabulary is growing every day, by leaps and bounds, his confidence about talking to strangers is very impressive, and speaking up too! "My name isn't Riko! My name is Riku" is what he told the neighbour at the dinner party a few days ago. </p>
<p>He wants to know about everything: "What you talking about?" "What you talking about now?" and "What is protected?" he asked Gail tonight after she told him the paper protected his crayon from breaking. Nothing gets left unanswered or unquestioned these days. Today I overheard him telling Tom that some people have large nipples and some have small and "What kind of nipples you have?" "I have small ones, but I am little. One day I will be bigger and have big nipples." </p>
<p>While I was bathing Riku, Gail cooked a very tasty meal for the two of us... a stir fry with red and yellow peppers and sesame-topped tofu; I shouldn't have eaten it all, and could easily have saved half of it for tomorrow, but it was far too good to resist! </p>
<p>Riku had a little tofu, and a generous portion of his mac and cheese with fresh tomatoes, "bacon", and an orange and a banana half. He did some more coloring; a puzzle with Uncle Tom and a story with Auntie Gail finished off his day. He had a hard time falling asleep tonight though, which really surprised me; he was tired, relaxed, had a full tummy and was happy, but it was very hot in his room despite the fan, dogs were barking in the neighbourhood, children were playing nearby and he could hear them calling to each other, he had many spots to scratch, and a lot of questions to ask. Finally gave in at 9 P.M. an hour after would have been ideal. Ah well, I can well remember those hot Ontario nights as a child when I tossed and turned too, trying hard to drift off. It's bound to happen. </p>
<p>Gail and I made up lunch for tomorrow; Jody and Judi and possibly Taryn will be here with us for a few hours. More on that tomorrow... <br />
bedtime, after a wonderful day, at 11:40.</p>
