								<h2>Dreams...</h2>
								<p>Riku had a restless night last night; I guess he is getting a cold, as he was quite stuffy while trying to get to sleep, and then today had a runny nose and a couple of sneezes. Darn! Just when he was finally feeling better and getting over the coughing/fever business that he has struggled with. However, unless he is wrapped in cotton wool and kept in the house with no one else around, he is going to be exposed to cold germs. </p>
<p>I told Riku he had a few dreams last night; I remember him waking to tell me he wanted gingerbread men. He was very interested to hear about it and then asked me if I "bemembered" my dream about losing my purse and going on a plane. The subject came up again later as we watched a Pingu episode, where Pingu dreams about a big mean looking walrus. Wee Bryn was always afraid of that particular segment and would leave the room about one minute before the walrus appeared; Riku had the same reaction to it, and has been telling me he doesn't want to see the walrus. However, this morning he said he would like to, knowing it was about a dream, so I held him on my lap and we talked about it. </p>
<p>He had a wonderful time building houses with the plastic magnet tiles of Amelia's. I think we will get an extra set in soon, as he made some really wonderful structures with them, and sat for the longest time on his own working away at pointed roofs and overhangs "case it rains". </p>
<p>Riku's appetite is back in full swing so I hope to see his weight rise back to 32 pounds; he was down to just 30 the last visit to the doctor. He ate banana slices, strawberries, and vanilla soy before his breakfast a bit later of hot cereal with blueberries. For lunch he ate an omelette with spinach and mushrooms with fresh tomato on the side,  a full slice of toast, and then asked for two pieces of "bacon". He is enjoying the dark brown organic apple juice Doug picked up for him last week. He had a full container of yogurt with flax seed stirred in, for his snack, and half of his chocolate egg from school on Friday. Dinner was a veggie and noodle soup... celery, carrots, spinach, and tofu with whole grain noodles, and a whole small apple for dessert, cut into slim pieces. </p>
<p>Okay, our day in a large nutshell... off to the new-to-us playground at Clipper and Douglass Streets. It is great! Lots of donated large plastic toys... kitchen, little house, stoves, pans, etc., plus the usual climbing structure, but this one has a great chain link ladder, which Riku really liked. It leans slightly inwards, so is much easier for the younger children to climb. There were two birthday parties being held in the large area at the back and Riku had lots of fun joining in chasing bubbles, and then climbing up along the path into the wooded area. He had lots of time in the sandbox, and during the hour and half we were there had lots of companions sharing the toys and building alongside of him. </p>
<p>Home for lunch and then nap time; a perfect hour and a half ending at 3:15. We took turns pretending we were ghosts after his nap, covering our heads with his small cotton blanket and waving our arms about. He loved it and was laughing so hard; I stopped it sooner than he would have liked as I could just imagine his bumping into door knobs and corners, but it was fun while it lasted. </p>
<p>The afternoon passed quickly, as he spent some time drawing in his "studio", "rescuing" me from bad guys, with a "weapon" built from two long Lego pieces, attached to three smaller ones across the top. Looks like a gun to me, but he mostly calls it a weapon and is happy to "save" me from monsters. The "monster spray" we have been using up 'til now seems to have passed its power to this new weapon, but the "spray" (just a finger up in the air pushing a pretend button) has fallen out of favour for sure. </p>
<p>Akane walked over with Mirei about 4 P.M. and visited with us until 7:30 or so. Mirei was her usual smiling self, making lots of sounds back to me when I talked to her, admiring the big chicken in the kitchen, spending a little time lying on the bed looking at the bird and train mobiles, as well as some brightly-coloured stuffed animals, and enjoying the attention her big brother gives her. She really beams at him, and with good reason; he is very attentive to her and gets in close to her for lots of cuddles and chats. </p>
<p>In the living room, Akane put the train together that Riku's Grandpa in Japan gave to him for Christmas; Bryn and Akane just found the battery charger a few days ago. It may have to go up to our bedroom, as the living room is small already and now there is no easy access to the sofa or one of the chairs! </p>
<p>I made a couple of banana loaves, fixed Riku's soup, made up some tomato sauce and pasta, and a side dish of spinach for Akane and me, and spent as much time with Mirei as I could. She got fussy at dinner time, as babies often do, so I held her on my lap while Akane ate, and ate with one hand until Akane was ready to nurse her. I'm sure she was sound asleep before Akane arrived home. </p>
<p>Riku wanted an ABC book for his main book tonight; he has been enjoying the ABC placemat the last couple of days and repeating which words start with particular letters. He was painting with brushes when Akane walked in, and finished up a lovely painting, brushing some colour over the previous ones and coming up with a new look for him. He is very serious about how many drops of paint he wants and where he wants them. It's fun to watch him carefully making these decisions. </p>
<p>Bryn was working hard in San Diego, while his friends were out hiking. We just IM'd very briefly, as I was busy with Riku. He returns home tomorrow night. Doug Skyped from Boston, after enjoying a day there on his own. He starts work in the morning. </p>
<p>I had lots of "I love you soooo much" today; such a sweet thing to here from this little boy. </p>
<p>Also, at one point when Riku was saying "I not like anybody", I repeated it back to him; he looked at me quite surprised and said "you really angry, Nana?". I said I wasn't and he said "Oh, you just pretending. Me too. Let's not be really angry; we just pretend." Fine with me. He is such a happy little boy, and very patient, building his house over and over when it collapsed on him today, and yet occasionally this angst overcomes him, and I think he really is trying to gauge our reaction to it. </p>
<p>Off I go... kitchen cleaned up, Riku's "studio" tidied up after lots of artistic paper-tearing projects this evening, and gluing too! He had little squares which he likes to colour with his markers, and was delighted when I gave him the glue stick so that he could stick them all on a big piece of paper. So easy to make him happy... </p>
<p>Night night... almost 11 P.M.</p>
