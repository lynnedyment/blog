								<h2>Wednesday with Riku</h2>
								<p>Foggy day today. Bryn and Riku have a new Wednesday morning routine; before heading off to school and work, they stop in for an early morning visit with Amelia. It's on the way to school, so very handy, and the children have a little time in the house together and then head out to the playground across the street for a little exercise. </p>
<p>I puttered away in the morning doing various clean up jobs, mostly paper work and phone calls, and also wrote up lots of birthday/anniversary cards ready to mail when I'm away. </p>
<p>Left the house at 12:40 for pick-up; Riku was coughing and still has his cold today, so had a hard time staying awake in the car this afternoon. Back at home he slept for less than an hour since he was coughing so badly; he woke feeling very hot. Poor wee guy; he is obviously tired, but despite the elevated position I had him in (with a pillow under the mattress) he just coughed himself awake each time.</p>
<p> So, he stayed awake and sat in bed for the longest time, after dragging a few books from the front bedroom to his room. He sat "reading to himself" and told me that "the icky monster book is my favourite book". Bryn had sent this book over from their house since they don't care for it, but right now Riku does. </p>
<p>Bryn IM'd me to tell me a funny Amelia story today... Susan was looking for Amelia when they first showed up, and overlooked her in her bedroom. Standing right at the doorway of the room, she was calling out for her in a loud voice when Amelia piped up in a very quiet little voice, "I am right here Mommy." </p>
<p>After going through his huge stack of books, Riku spent some time at his little table, colouring his few special rocks! with washable pens; this was a first. He was very meticulous about it, and worked away at this project for a good half hour. </p>
<p>Then we went out to the garden for some sweeping and weeding (and fresh air; not enough energy for the playground today) ending up there for an hour and a half. I was a mess at the end of it, as the pollen was heavy and I was sneezing and sniffing terribly when we came in. The yard looks great though! <br />
 <br />
While having his snack, Riku was chatting away to himself and I managed to jot some of it down... "I'm using all the pens. I need many things; I have to use them every time." and "I'm a big boy now and I am vewy vewy strong!" </p>
<p>He spent the last forty-five minutes of his time here working on lots of puzzles on his bed, going through about seven of them. Today he did the alphabet puzzles for the first time in a long time. We went outside to the front of the house with chalk while waiting for Bryn to come for him at 6:30; it was good timing as we got to talk to the man out walking his little dog. The timing was perfect. </p>
<p>Had some news from Virginia today about Uncle Frank's follow-up visit to his surgeon. UF is healing very well, and the doctor is very pleased with the results of the surgery. UF is already walking tall although is still in some pain. </p>
<p>My evening flew by as usual; I chatted with Doug on Skype after having some problems with it, and answered a few emails.. and my evening disappeared too quickly.</p>
