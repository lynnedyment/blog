								<h2>Tomorrow's the Weekend! ... and Happy Birthday to Sheldon</h2>
								<p>Doug and I both slept until 8:20 this morning; it has been a long time since this has happened. I was reading until 12:45 A.M., but that was still a long sleep! </p>
<p>Spent the morning at home, finishing up cards and puttering about. Tammy e-mailed photos of how the office staff decorated for Sheldon's 63rd birthday, with lots of balloons, pink flamingoes on the front lawn, and a banner suggesting folks honk in his honour! Lots of fun for him and he was beaming away in the photos. </p>
<p>Leaving at 12:40 to pick up Riku arrived very quickly somehow. Riku came up the stairs smiling but looking tired; Bryn said he was awake at 6:10 this morning, slept on Bryn's neck for another half hour, a funny little habit Riku has. He just likes skin contact, I think. </p>
<p>He had a lovely start to his morning, with a visit with his dad to Amelia's house for a little breakfast and some playtime in the park across the street before heading for school. </p>
<p>I took along three new books to read to him in the car. He liked them all, and after I read each one to him, he spent lots of time just looking them over on his own. By the time we got home he had memorized half the pages in one of them; it's a simple board book he should have had long ago "Brown Bear, Brown Bear", but both Bryn and Caillie liked it a lot and I hated to have him not know it. </p>
<p>He had a whole banana and soy milk in the car and was more than ready to be tucked in when we got home; he asked to go to bed now! He is sleeping with no sounds of congestion and no coughing, good signs as he has been fighting them both again this week. </p>
<p>I called Candy and we chatted for a half hour; she and Rick were on their way out with Brian for dinner, but it was good to catch up with her. </p>
<p>Riku napped for two and a half hours this afternoon and wasn't quite ready to awaken even then. I opened his door but didn't snuggle in with him as I knew he would have dropped right off again. He ate a bowl of hot cereal, sat on my lap, and was just not quite himself. Doug and I were going off to a book reading, so I walked Riku home for some fresh air and a little exercise. He happily carried his pinwheel for a bit, watching it spin, but was tired enough that he tried hard to talk me into carrying him most of the way. I gave in on the last block and it helped that Lily was at the dry cleaners, so that we could wave to her. </p>
<p>Mirei was looking very pink and happy, sitting on the counter with a bright pink hat and outfit on. We exchanged big smiles and down I went to meet Doug, who had driven over to get me. </p>
<p>We drove to "A Clean Well-Lighted Place for Books" to see and hear Paul Rusesabagina, the now famous hotel manager depicted in the film <em>Hotel Rwanda.</em> He saved 1200 people from certain death by giving them refuge in the hotel; he and his family were threatened and given a chance to escape but he stayed behind, and luckily survived the horror that took place there. He was a very inspirational and interesting speaker, speaking from his heart and with very strong opinions about the U.N. forces who left them without any means of protecting themselves. </p>
<p>Out for a delicious bean burrito on Mission Street; I intended eating only half but was hungrier than I thought, and ate the whole thing. Home at 9 P.M.</p>
