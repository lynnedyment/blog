								<h2>No Amelia...</h2>
								<p>Bryn dropped in very early this morning unannounced; I was up and busy at the computer at 7:30 having already showered and made my bed. He was here to frame a couple of Akane's etchings before driving Riku to school. He thought it best not to bring Riku over, even though he wanted so much to "help". </p>
<p>Susan was quite sure yesterday that Amelia had an earache; she has been having a terrible time sleeping, which is often worse when Amelia is coming down with something, and so decided to take Amelia to the doctor this morning, rather than send her to school. She called me to confirm that Amelia does indeed have an ear infection and is now on antibiotics. Susan felt it best to nap with her today instead of bringing her here to me; they both need the sleep and Amelia tends to sleep longer when she is in bed with her mom for her naps. </p>
<p>Since Riku is still sick with his cold and cough, and Akane was at the studio this morning, I decided to pick Riku up from school and have him nap here. He sleeps longer and Akane can continue working at the studio. It's open house this weekend and she has been there a lot lately. </p>
<p>Riku woke up with bright red cheeks and is still coughing; poor wee guy, it will be good to see an end to this, if we ever do! It has all been going on for so long now. He sat on his bed for the longest time playing with all of his cars and wanting me to play with him in there. He had no interest at all in going outside today, even though I tried to coax him into getting a little bit of fresh air. We played with many of his animals too, and they were all involved with the cars and accidents and rescues too! </p>
<p>Bryn called to see if I wanted to go to the studio with them. Akane needs to be there to help with getting the studio ready for tomorrow night; I was ready to beg off, since I really want to get busy with some photo annotation tonight, and was tired, but Bryn thought it would be good for me to get out and for Riku to hang around the studio too. So, Riku and I met them at the studio at 6:15. Bryn was busy hanging Akane's art pieces and so Riku and I took a stroll around looking at all the other art. We told each other which we liked and which we didn't, with Riku asking occasionally, "What this one about, Nana?", and often we just had to take turns guessing. </p>
<p>Mirei and I had a stroll around too while Riku really did help his Dad hang some art. Bryn taught him how to carefully use the wire cutters and had him snip off the pieces he needed, after which Riku made a nice neat little pile of various sizes. I was very impressed with how careful he really was being, as the edges were very sharp and could have hurt him. He took the job very seriously and did well. </p>
<p>Mirei was sitting in her little soft seat looking very comfortable and as happy and chunky as ever. The smiles from that girl; they are just the sweetest smiles in the world, since she smiles and her entire face just lights up! I picked her up and walked her around the studio, happily showing her off to all the women who smiled at her and commented on those cheeks of hers! </p>
<p>There was free pizza for dinner, so there went my plans for a salad for me tonight; it was delicious, with a nice tasty sauce, from Pizza Man in Noe Valley, Bryn thought. </p>
<p>I went home with them at 7:20 and almost immediately started the process of tucking Riku into bed; he needed a snack first though, and had a quick tub, so it was close to 8:45 before I finished his stories.  He took longer to fall asleep than usual, but I think his breathing once again made it hard for him to relax. It was close to 9:30, before I felt I could leave the room. </p>
<p>Bryn had talked me into staying and watching a rented DVD of ours with them, but it was a mistake since I was quite sure I would fall asleep. Once they turned the lights off in the living room for Mirei, who had been awake at that point for thirteen hours except for a twenty minute cat nap(!), I fell asleep too. </p>
<p>I drove home, a very tired gal, at close to 11 P.M. I washed and undressed for bed, and sat watching an Oprah tape, but started drifting off half way through it. I'm going to have Amelia with me tomorrow morning to make up for not seeing her today, so there will be no sleeping in for me in the morning... bed at 11:30 P.M. </p>
<p>Beth's last night with email connection for a while; they move tomorrow!</p>
