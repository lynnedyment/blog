								<h2>No Rain Today!!!</h2>
								<p>'Twas a lovely day today, with sunshine by mid-morning and lots of it all afternoon. I started my day off by sleeping in later than usual... 7:45 and then lying in bed reading for another forty-five minutes. Yawn! What a lazy day; it felt like a Sunday. </p>
<p>Bryn came by, accompanied by Riku, with a big hug and an even bigger smile. He was looking very handsome this morning with a sweet light-coloured tailored shirt, a change from his usual pullover cotton tops. The sleeves were rolled back at the cuffs, and the little collar and button-downed front just looked so sweet on him. </p>
<p>Bryn had brought over their laundry, so while he sorted out the first load, Riku sat at the table building a house with the magnetic tiles. He ate some yogurt, drank some vanilla soymilk, and enjoyed his quiet time with me, as I did with him. Riku spotted the flowers from Susan on the kitchen counter, and said "Wow! I like those flowers. I like the big pink ones and the little purple ones too. Do you like them Nana?" I sure do. In less than at hour, at 10:15, they left to go to the movies with Kevin and Amelia. They saw "Ice Age 2" and apparently both children sat very quietly and paid attention to what was going on with the film. Later on Riku told me it was a little bit scary as the ice was cracking and there were dinosaurs and tigers on the ice. They ate popcorn too. I will hear more about it throughout the week, I am sure. </p>
<p>Doug had gone off to his T'ai Chi lesson earlier, so I caught up on some emails, and was chatting on the phone with Tay when Riku and Bryn walked in. Riku was a very tired little boy, in his dad's arms, having just fallen asleep in the car. We read two books, "Alexander" and "Inch by Inch", and then it took six minutes to sing to him and walk out the door, leaving a sleeping boy behind. Today he chose to sleep with his big mouse from Jody, and the black and white big fluffy dog we bought for Mirei. </p>
<p>Riku napped for two hours while Bryn went off for a while, and I continued with the laundry, made a fruit bowl, which I had been intending to do all week, and caught up on more emails. It's a long process as I still have ninety to answer or deal with. </p>
<p>There was a problem with our mail server this morning; it was so odd to have no personal emails in, but to have no junk mail either made me realize there was a problem. After his class, Doug worked with the technicians at the server site and not too much later there was lots of mail... a great photo album from Tracy on their trip to France, news from Gail on their garage sale today, and some news from Glenn and Candy too. Beth must be busy packing up her house for the big move. </p>
<p>Riku ate a little snack before they left for a visit with Alex and his parents... he spotted the mango I was cutting up and ate lots of it, and then ate some scrambled egg, "bacon", and a little toast. They went off at 3:30 or so, Kelly called on Skype, and we had a good long chat, with a couple of interruptions, while Doug went for some groceries, a chore he has taken over much to my delight. Gregg called Kelly for dinner, homemade sushi, made by Gregg of course, and I made a cup of tea and sat and read with my feet up on the chesterfield. Ahh, life is good. I needed this time on my own. </p>
<p>Doug had picked up a good frozen pizza, which went into the oven immediately, while I peeled carrots and celery and cooked up a bowl of spinach with pine nuts to accompany it. We sat eating and watching three taped TV shows, enjoying every moment of it. I even got a good back rub during the last show. A little more computer time, and back up to watch one last show...</p>
