								<h2>A Rare Two-Movie Day!</h2>
								<p>As Riku says: It's the weekend! A long time ago Doug and I often used to see a double feature on both days of the weekend, but then he was out of work for over two years, we cut back on outings like this, which often involved dinner out as well, and then discovered Netflix, which allowed us to see all these same great movies at home. But it is still a treat to get out of the house and sit in a dark theater, where I am not reminded that the bedroom really needs a good vacuuming, or the bathroom needs cleaning the next day. </p>
<p>Doug went off to his T'ai Chi class at 9:40, picking up Bryn and Riku on his way, so they could borrow the car for a quick trip to Japantown. I vacuumed the bedroom, despite my usual no-housework-on-the-weekend rule, and then did a lot of catching up on my emails. I also packed us each a sandwich to eat at the movie, as well as some fruit for dessert. I have some weight to lose, and as much as I hate to give up my two-bucket popcorn habit (I do share with Doug, but I eat most of it!), I just must be more disciplined about what I am eating and in the case of the popcorn... how much!  </p>
<p>Our movies were at the Four Star Theatre out in the Richmond District and we saw two movies for just $7.00 the pair... a huge bargain. What a treat this was... "Little Miss Sunshine" had been highly recommended by both Susan and Liz, and we agreed completely with them, and then so enjoyed Maggie Smith and Rowan Atkinson in "Keeping Mum", a dark comedy. The acting was just terrific in both of them. </p>
<p>We bought four big new crop pomegranates at the independent grocer next to the theatre, and then treated ourselves to a rare dinner out. There is a great little pizzeria near the Four Star with just four indoor tables and two outside, and it was the perfect place for an early dinner. We shared a starter of lightly sauteed thin green beans, with slices of a mild French feta, small heirloom tomatoes, and a slice of crusty grilled bread topped with tapenade. Next came the pizza they are well known for... thin crispy crusts and topped with a fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, and basil. It was all delicious, and tastier because it has been ages since we ate there. </p>
<p>Once home, Doug and I checked our emails and then went through Amelia's birthday parties photos, managing to get them down to just 100! There were lots of fun photos of all the children at the party, as well as their parents, so I shall get those annotated as soon as possible. </p>
<p>We're still trying to get through a huge stack of tapes and movies from my six weeks away in August and September, so watched the first two hours of a Robert Duvall western. It is set in 1898, just two years before Gram was born, and it's hard to imagine that just four generations ago, young Chinese girls were being sent from China to be sold to the highest bidder in the mining towns in the U.S.A. The two hours flew by, and we shall watch the rest of it tomorrow night. </p>
<p><br />
Bryn had left a message on our answering machine inviting us to join them, Brent, and a young woman from work plus her husband, for vegetable tempura. However, we had just eaten and even though I was tempted to go over to see the children (this was my first day since arriving home three weeks ago that I didn't see them!), I resisted and just relaxed with Doug at home. We also had an invitation to join them for dim sum tomorrow morning, a place they all went to when I was in Ontario, or as Bryn put it, "when I deserted the family". </p>
<p>I spoke briefly with Riku who had just put on his Ultraman Hallowe'en costume for the guests; Bryn said he was a little shy in it, but if he wears it a few times by Hallowe'en he will be feeling his "power" in it. They were busy icing gingerbread people so we ended our conversation with our "I love you" and "night night."</p>
