								<h2>"49 Up".. and Catching Up.. a Night Alone at Home</h2>
								<p>I slept in again this morning until almost 8 A.M., a lovely way to start off the weekend. Usual morning routine... checked emails, wrote to my sisters, showered, had breakfast while reading the paper, and waved goodbye to Doug as he left for T'ai Chi. Hard to decide whether to iron or to sit and catch up on emails, but the latter won out. It's something I can only do when the children aren't here, whereas Mirei is very happy  to crawl around the bedroom, exploring the Lego and book and stuffed animal baskets, while I iron. </p>
<p>Doug and I left the house at 11:30 for two Freecycle pick-ups... a soaker hose and a bag full of sketching pencils for Riku, both of which will be very useful. We were in the Richmond District, which is chock full of Chinese restaurants, and chose a new vegetarian spot, called "Bok Choy Garden". The food was delicious... we had potstickers, mu shu vegetables and a sweet "beef" dish with snow peas and carrots. The host was very friendly; they just opened under new owners two weeks ago, and he assured us they will eventually do our old favourite dish from years ago, Beijing duck, as well as Doug's favourite twice-cooked tofu and lemon "duck". It these are done well, we'll be back there many times. </p>
<p>Drove to the Opera Plaza cinema to see the latest in the long running series of "7 Up" films. It's a British documentary done with a group of children from various backgrounds, who are interviewed every seven years from the age of seven. We are now up to "49 Up" and what a delight it always is to see how they are all doing. What was surprising to us this time is how many of them resent this intrusion into their lives, but luckily for us, continue to agree to be interviewed. One fellow, Neil, an upper-class child, has held our interest particularly as he has been through some very rough times; this film shows him thriving after years and years of heartbreak. He is my favourite person, although somehow we feel attached to them all. </p>
<p>We stopped for a big supply of fresh veggies and staples at Rainbow on our way home, and Doug left almost instantly for an evening out with a fellow PEA member, who is in town for six weeks with his amazing (and world renowned) act called "Mind Games". They had dinner together, and I spent the evening culling through old emails, making great headway. </p>
<p>I even turned down a tempting invitation over to Hampshire Street, to spend some time with Bryn and Mirei after Riku was tucked in. Riku had a friend, Alex, over tonight while his parents went out for dinner , so Riku would have been a tired boy at the end of his busy day. Hard as it was I Instead did what I intended to do, after turning down dinner plans with Doug and Marc as well, and am well on my way to catching up on emails. Too many friends have been too long neglected. </p>
<p>The clocks get turned back tonight, Doug had a headache, and so off we went off to bed earlier than usual, with lots of time to read. Lights out at 11 P.M. although the clock said 10 o'clock.</p>
<p>or the 28th... the following... </p>
<p><br />
long nap for mirei... up now and nice, big, soft BM<br />
bryn says:<br />
she slept for over six hours last night!<br />
bryn says:<br />
straight, that is<br />
bryn says:<br />
riku and i off for a walk... burrito pickup for akane....<br />
bryn says:<br />
yo<br />
bryn says:<br />
u there?<br />
Lynne says:<br />
hi... no doubt you are busy now with Alex and Riku...<br />
bryn says:<br />
I am currently away from the computer.<br />
Lynne says:<br />
just home now at 5:35<br />
Lynne says:<br />
enjoy your evening... great news about six hours sleep for Mirei... I bet she likes having room to sprawl about<br />
Lynne says:<br />
and a nice long nap too... both morning and afternoon?<br />
Lynne says:<br />
chat later perhaps...<br />
Lynne says:<br />
I think "The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark" just arrived for you...<br />
bryn says:<br />
things are going well<br />
Lynne says:<br />
good<br />
bryn says:<br />
she just went down for her "afternoon" nap<br />
bryn says:<br />
but should work out ok<br />
Lynne says:<br />
wow... late!<br />
Lynne says:<br />
really, she just had the one nap today?<br />
bryn says:<br />
yeah, it was late-ish<br />
bryn says:<br />
we tried earlier with no luck<br />
bryn says:<br />
i guess the longer night sleep gave her more energy<br />
bryn says:<br />
i think it was noon - 2pm?<br />
Lynne says:<br />
usually it's the other way around... the babies who nap well during the day also nap well at night<br />
Lynne says:<br />
Amelia is a good example of the other<br />
Lynne says:<br />
doesn't sleep well at night or during the day... without a lot of trouble<br />
bryn says:<br />
i definitely tried earlier but she wasn't ready<br />
Lynne says:<br />
ah well, keep trying<br />
bryn says:<br />
she's had a good day, mood-wise<br />
Lynne says:<br />
nice to have her sleeping during Riku's last hour or so up<br />
bryn says:<br />
y<br />
Lynne says:<br />
49 Up was amazing!<br />
bryn says:<br />
if she wakes at 7:30 or 8, that's ok maybe<br />
Lynne says:<br />
we both love that series so much<br />
bryn says:<br />
spend the next two hours feeding her then tuck-in<br />
Lynne says:<br />
yes, just keep her moving!<br />
bryn says:<br />
would love to see it<br />
bryn says:<br />
riku got out three times today... he'll sleep well<br />
Lynne says:<br />
great!<br />
bryn says:<br />
he's coughing but very little<br />
bryn says:<br />
a walk, a long trike trip, and the park w. alex<br />
Lynne says:<br />
whew... we seemed to have stopped it in its tracks<br />
bryn says:<br />
alex is a great role model for him, fitness-wise<br />
bryn says:<br />
"why is alex always winning?"<br />
Lynne says:<br />
riku is really picking up on it tho<br />
bryn says:<br />
"don't worry riku, we're not racing"<br />
Lynne says:<br />
wants to be bush now at the park and not sitting watching<br />
Lynne says:<br />
nice of Alex!<br />
bryn says:<br />
alex went down our hall stairs head-first...<br />
Lynne says:<br />
no!<br />
bryn says:<br />
no, that was my answer!<br />
bryn says:<br />
on purpose, "like a penguin!"<br />
Lynne says:<br />
ohhhhhh<br />
bryn says:<br />
riku, of course, followed suit<br />
Lynne says:<br />
whew!<br />
bryn says:<br />
and did just fine<br />
bryn says:<br />
they did great at the park...<br />
bryn says:<br />
now it's dinner... shall run<br />
Lynne says:<br />
ok<br />
Lynne says:<br />
bye for now xo</p>
