								<h2>Little Miss Pointer, Actually</h2>
								<p>Doug turned all the clocks back last night when we went to bed at 11 P.M., but I think since the clock read 10 o'clock my body felt it was too early to be sleeping! I had trouble staying asleep, woke up at 5:30 (formerly 6:30) and stayed up. I will have no problems sleeping tonight at all! Yawn! </p>
<p>Doug, Bryn, Riku (aka Ultraman!.. yes, he was wearing his costume again this Sunday), and I headed off to Costco at 10 o'clock for a quick run-through; it was too early for samples, one of the things I like best about Costco(!), but it was just as well. We got through the line quickly, and dropped Bryn and Riku off at Ashbury Street, for a little play time for the children, and for Bryn to borrow Susan's & Kevin's car. I had offered to babysit for all four of them to see "49 Up", but Amelia needs her afternoon nap for sure, and it wouldn't necessarily have happened here with me. We'll try for Wednesday night, as I know they would both like to see the film as well. </p>
<p>Riku and Mirei were here at 2:35; Mirei was supposed to be ready for her nap but apparently she wasn't told about it, as she fussed just long enough that I knew it wasn't going to happen. So, up she got and  played with Riku on the floor for quite a while; I wouldn't be at all surprised if she soon is crawling on her hands and knees, and gives up her "GI Joe" crawl. I could see her trying over and over to get herself up today, and standing for a long time at the mirrored glass in the oven. </p>
<p>Despite her daddy having told me that she had eaten a large meal two hours ago, and nursed just fifteen minutes before they brought her over, this was a hungry girl less than an hour later! She must be going through a growth spurt, as she is obviously happy to eat every two hours or so! She ate a portion of veggies, and then another of cereal mixed with the veggies, sipped down a portion of breast milk, and an hour and a half later I left a sleeping baby in the room, all bundled up. She was funny today, though, as for the first time she made little growling sounds as she was trying to settle herself... quite forceful ones too! Such funny sounds to be coming out of this very sweet little female child! </p>
<p>I had asked Riku if he would be very quiet while I tucked Mirei in, and not to come into the room while I was with her. What a guy! I came out about seven minutes later (I ended up bundling her, as I think she was overtired and not giving in to it) to find him in the front bedroom, with a nice stack of books on the bed, leafing through what was obviously more than the first one. I was so proud of him, and told him so. </p>
<p>He asked if I could feed him some pasta while we watched TV together, and since this is such a rare treat for us, up we went to see some Pixar shorts (he watched "Tin Toy" twice), and then about half a tape of snow-blowing. He ate all the pasta and a "meatball", and finished off a half slice of "Grandpa's special toast" as well. We sat on the floor together while he built a long train and chatted away to himself about what was happening... it was backing up, going over big snow-covered hills, getting stuck, getting unstuck... quite an adventure! We came downstairs and he had a little time to play with his shells before his parents arrived home. </p>
<p>Mirei had been up for just ten minutes or so; she napped for a full two hours, and spent that ten minutes doing exactly what Bryn told me she had been doing all morning.... using her index finger constantly, to point out things she wanted to see, or to merely touch fingers with me, just wanting to connect I suppose. It is darling. She looked adorable in a pair of pink gingham overalls and a sweet cream-coloured top that my friend Judi Speirs gave to her. </p>
<p>As soon as Mirei had nursed (underfed child that she is!), off they all went home. It was close to 6 P.M. and tomorrow is a school day for Riku, with a bath, dinner, and some story time before bed at 7:30. </p>
<p>I had a couple of hours to myself before Doug arrived back from his day out with Marc; they met for lunch, did lots of sightseeing in the city, and ended up in Berkeley for pizza at Zachary's. There were even two slices brought home for me which I shall enjoy for my lunch tomorrow! I sat in the living room eating leftover pasta and drinking a hot cup of tea once I was on my own. </p>
<p>Today was a marathon emailing day, although I am still in the middle of answering numbers of emails from two good friends, but down to a mere twenty once those are done! I am really seeing the light at the end of the tunnel here. Whew! I really believe it has been two years since I have been down to zero waiting to be answered. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched an "Inspector Linley" episode, a British detective show, one we always enjoy. I got a nice long backrub and came very close to dozing off during it... but I'm off to bed now at 11:20.  </p>
<p>P.S. I noticed Riku saying "actually" several times today. It's very cute, as it is a Dyment word for certain. I so well remember hearing Caillie saying it when she was a little girl. In fact, I believe I remember the first sentence I heard her use it in. She had "painted" her fingernails and part of her arms with coloured icing, being used on Valentine's Day cookies. A little girl, whom Kelly babysat, told her that it was icing for the cookies, in quite an imperious little five year old voice. Caillie answered back immediately with "Actually Emma, it is nail polish." looking and sounding ever so serious! We howled with laughter; I have a photo of the results too. </p>
<p>Funny how things come to you at the end of the day, so I am adding this to my blog the next day. Riku had a tiny dish of vanilla chocolate fudge ice cream yesterday afternoon. I teased him a little, saying I wasn't sure he was going to like it. Of course he did and polished it off saying "that was <strong>very</strong> good!" and then announced, out of the blue about two hours later "That ice cream was <strong>amazing</strong>!" </p>
<p>And when Bryn and Akane dropped in to pick up the children, Bryn asked Riku to tell me about his bad dream from the night before. It was a sad one... he dreamed that I was lost at an airport and he couldn't find me. Bryn said it took him about four minutes to get him to awaken and settle him down from it, as he was crying in his sleep. Poor wee guy.</p>
