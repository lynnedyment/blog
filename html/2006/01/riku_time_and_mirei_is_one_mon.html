								<h2>Riku Time... and Mirei is One Month Old!</h2>
								<p>I awoke nice and early this morning, at 7 a.m., so down I went to check emails. The backlog is overwhelming, but I shall get through them sooner or later. </p>
<p>As soon as I had showered, I got busy sorting through the big stack of Christmas cards on my kitchen counter. Doug had told me, when I was in Japan, which ones had come in, but there had been some in during the past two weeks as well. I read each and every one, taking a few minutes to write email thank you messages for a few special ones. </p>
<p>Doug went off to his T'ai Chi class at 9:40 and I had soon had the entire kitchen table covered with various piles of cards. I miss opening them during the holidays, but they are no less special when viewed for the first time in mid-January either. </p>
<p>At 11:30 Bryn dropped Riku off... a tired, jet-lagged boy. He had not been happy sharing his toys with Amelia, who was over for a visit with her parents to meet Mirei. Bryn said he was ready for a good nap and more food so we got busy with both. First, however, Riku was more than happy to sit and play with the clay Susan has temporarily donated to the Dyment household for the children's amusement. Riku thoroughly enjoys sitting and digging into the clay/sand, making hills and balls, and running his little tractor into it to make tracks and bulldoze over his structures. </p>
<p>I fed him a big bowl of oatmeal with blueberries while he played; he ate every bite, and then helped me make fresh orange juice. He's a big boy and knew he couldn't touch the sharp knife but could put his hand on mine while the electric juicer went around and around. All of the grandchildren have loved watching the juice fall into the glass, and of course they have all enjoyed drinking it too. </p>
<p>Riku napped for two full hours. Once again I saw him smiling in his sleep, the sweetest thing. What lovely dreams he must have! </p>
<p>He went right back to the clay box after he woke, and I took advantage of his busy hands to feed him again. He had asked for "bacon, eggs, and toast" and ate three slices of "bacon", all the rest of his breakfast, plus a half banana and lots of strawberries while I prepared the hot food. </p>
<p>Off we went to the playground at 4:20; it was still light out, and there was a weak stream of sunshine at this point. Riku was in his stroller, snacking on cookies and juice, just like the "old days", happily chatting about what we were seeing along the way. He was delighted that the playground was still open; I had warned him that it might not be. I had forgotten his sand toys but he played so happily with a brightly coloured ball, finding various adults who would kick it back to him, and a little girl who rescued it each time it went too far, and would bring it back to him. </p>
<p>The playground closed at 5:25 today and we walked home. Riku was sad and cried a little when we had to leave, but once home invited me into his room to play. Mirei had just nursed and was wide awake, so I held her on my lap as Bryn played with his Daddy on the floor with us. </p>
<p>Mirei is amazing; she smiles so readily. She has the tiniest little mouth when she purses it up; Bryn told me she does this a lot, but if you just make a clicking sound, she looks up and starts smiling a very big smile. She pays such attention to your face and seems to respond to every little change with that smile of hers. I had Bryn take a little video of her while she was doing this, and it is just adorable. We sat, getting to know each other, with Riku coming over for occasional kisses and snuggles with his sister. He's very gentle with her, and talks to her when he leans over for a kiss. </p>
<p>I left reluctantly at 6:30; holding a baby is the best! Bryn was getting Riku's dinner ready, in preparation for his normal bedtime, and Doug was no doubt waiting for his dinner too. We ate Japanese for dinner, courtesy of Susan, who had spoiled us yet again with a big bag of it a couple of days ago. The food was delicious as we shared five inari, big chunks of agedashi tofu, and a dark green vegetable called aji nanohana. I had polished off the kabocha salad for my lunch today. Yum! </p>
<p>The evening passed quickly... another TV show, shared the new Coke flavour, black cherry vanilla (too sweet for my taste), and then lots of time going through the photos of Japan (over 500 of them when we finished; more editing still to come!), and turned out the light at 1 a.m.</p>
