								<h2>Visitors, and Another Busy Day Passes By</h2>
								<p>Ah, what a lazybones I am here! Caillie and I both slept until 10:10 this morning and then lay about in bed for another half hour, chatting and back-drawing as we always do when there is time. Caillie asked me first thing what I had dreamt, and then told me her dreams. Not too many people care to hear this in my life, so it's fun for both of us. </p>
<p>However, once up we both really had to get moving as we were all leaving for the dentist at 11:40. Bryant and Myk' have appointments, and Bryn has had a popcorn kernel stuck in his lower gum since yesterday. He is in obvious pain and Kelly wanted the dentist to have a look at it. I took my knitting along, determined to finish the scarf up today, and did well with it since there is only one dentist and she saw all three children. No cavities! </p>
<p>On our way back to the car we stopped for one of Doug's and my favourite Toronto treats... veggie hot dogs grilled by street vendors. Bryn is not a fan but he was hungry enough that he had one too, along with Kelly and me. The other three children had regular hot dogs and Myk' was salivating as she had to wait a half hour after her fluoride treatment before eating hers. She was happy to reach the car and dig in! </p>
<p>The children talked Kelly into having chocolate fondue for dessert tonight. We were dashing home to be there when Sherri, Kelly's high school friend, arrived with her three and five year olds. Perfect timing as they had just pulled up after we did, complete with lots of fresh fruit we dashed in to pick up on the way home. </p>
<p>It was a very relaxing afternoon. The children went off to their rooms playing, or gathered around the computer for a while playing various games. We three adults just ignored the noise and confusion and sat chatting in the living room. I was knitting, and we caught up on our news. I showed Sherri some of the photos of Mirei of course, and she told us about plans to move to a smaller home in Sudbury. </p>
<p>Gregg put dinner on the table as usual, and as usual it was delicious. Kelly had made squash risotto two nights before, and the adults had that with a salad while the children enjoyed their spaghetti. Kelly made a wondeful salad for us, following Gregg's instructions, she told me later, to add walnuts, apple, and feta cheese to the mixed greens. Yum! </p>
<p>We took a little break from the table, while Kelly cut up the fruit and I tidied up the dishes. Soon we were dipping expensive and delicious strawberries, pears, apples, bananas, and tiny marshmallows (the children) into liquid Toblerone chocolate with nuts, mixed with some wonderful semi-sweet chocolate. It was so good, and even though I wasn't at all hungry I was very happy with this wonderful dessert. We had it last year while in the Manitoulin and I enjoyed it every bit as much this time. Missed our traditional cheese fondue this year, so it hardly seemed reasonable to miss out on the chocolate fondue as well. </p>
<p>The children were all very excited playing together and Ava and Matti kept begging for just a "few more minutes" before leaving for their hotel in Burlington. Our four older children were obviously all ready for bed at 9 p.m. when they left, and Caillie was still awake at 10:10 p.m., settling down shortly after that. </p>
<p>I had finished the last of the clean-up, and sat down with Gregg to finish off the scarf and watch TV. A few hours earlier I had asked Kelly and Sherri if they thought the scarf was long enough; Kelly suggested I finish off the bit of yarn I had left, while Sherri suggested I cast off. I should have listened to her as when I went to pick it up I found all the stitches of this very difficult-to-work with yarn off the needles! Argggh!!! Bryant told me that Matti had picked it up and moved it around; he had told him not to touch it but obviously by then it was too late. Ah well, that will teach me to leave it lying on the sofa and not putting it away somewhere safe. I read recently that knitting is very relaxing and lowers the blood pressure, and as this is about the ninth time I have had to re-knit it I must have the lowest blood pressure going! </p>
<p>Bedtime for the adults not much after 10:30 p.m. Night night...</p>
