								<h2>Another Beautiful Day!</h2>
								<p>It was lovely having Riku here with me from the time he opened his eyes in the morning. What a happy face to waken to! We cuddled for a bit, playing his latest favourite "game", pretending we are birds in a nest. Susan and Amelia have been playing this for some time, and since Riku loves the book "Are You My Mother", we have taken it up too, following their lead. The pillows are already laid out in a nest-like pattern, and from our cozy perch, we take turns peeping at each other and feeding the other pretend "worms". Riku is such a good mommy, and leans over me, very close to my mouth, to drop in the yummy pretend morsel he has collected for me. We read the book after we're finished and then it's time to get up! </p>
<p>Riku ate a <strong>huge</strong> amount of food this morning; he started off with two small bowls of fruit, bananas and sliced strawberries, with a cup of freshly squeezed orange juice. He is now completely toilet trained, waking with a dry diaper(!), and letting me know when "urine is coming!" or dashing towards the bathroom, calling out "BM!" </p>
<p>I dressed him and had him upstairs to see his very first episode of "Caillou" on our PBS station at 8:30 a.m. I wish I had had a camera to record that little face as it lit up seeing one of his current favourites "live". This was a great first episode too, as Caillou's grandpa was on the program, and of course his mommy, daddy, and baby sister Rosie too. I sat beside him as he beamed away, listening to Caillou not wanting to go to the playgroup, and wanting to go on a school bus for the first time. </p>
<p>He ate his full breakfast as soon as that was over... chose scrambled eggs and ate two of them, just more than a half slice of toast, and two pieces of "bacon". Following that, he played with his new white Play-Doh, enjoying the new cutters I bought in Japan, then his "clay" box, and finally spending over an hour in the garden with me, where we swept and pulled weeds. Riku had his big "Caterpillar" truck outside too, but was more interested in sweeping, and collecting the big sticks from the flower beds. The annuals are starting to bloom with the hyacinths already showing some pink tips. It was so sunny and warm out and we both just had light jackets on, undone. </p>
<p>Today we continued on in the very funny vein of "pretend" language we started yesterday. It was hilarious and Riku started it up today. We just talk gibberish to each other, but use a real sounding rhythm of language. He would say something along the lines of "Abba ca dough me?" and I would reply "shumo darbo eeky no" and on and on we would go, with exclamations, and questions, and lots of emphasis in various places, often ending with a big laugh, as though we both got the joke. What astounds both Doug and me is how quickly he caught on to all of this; he knows it's all pretend and yet can carry it on and on, coming up with all sorts of great pretend words. It's so funny and such fun! </p>
<p>Doug and Akane went off to Costco at 12:30. Akane had walked over with Mirei in the sling, and Mirei was fast asleep when Akane put her down on the sofa. Riku had had his lunch... some noodles and veggies, and then a yogurt, so I got him tucked into bed by 12:50, hoping to have some cuddle time with Mirei. However, it didn't happen; she just slept and slept and slept, looking very peaceful and in a deep sleep, with her arms over her head. My Mom always said this was the sign of a contented baby, and contented she was, for the next almost two hours! </p>
<p>I prepared a snack for Riku to take along to Ocean Beach with us (he napped for just one hour today), and Mirei woke in just enough time for me to hold her for two minutes, while Doug put the sling on to walk her home. Of course the minute Doug started to walk with her, Mirei was asleep again! What a very easy baby she is. I took photos of her sleeping, and have lots of these! </p>
<p>Riku and I were at the beach by 3:20. It was warmer than yesterday, and Riku settled in with his sand toys. The two big "mountains" from yesterday were gone, but we dug down for some wet sand and made a few cakes and shapes while waiting for Amelia and Susan to arrive. A little girl and her mom joined us when we first sat down, and she and Riku sat side by side, filling up containers. </p>
<p>We had almost an hour with Susan and Amelia; mostly they sat playing, while Susan built sand castles from the bucket, for each of them to knock down in turns. Not long before we had to leave, Riku started collecting feathers and sticks, and the two children went off down the beach on their own for an amble. </p>
<p>It was such fun to have both children there with me; Amelia insisted on carrying the big bag of sand toys all by herself all the way up the stairs from the beach to the car. What a girl!</p>
<p>Doug had his T'ai Chi class tonight, so I had to have the car home for him by 5:30. The sun was getting lower in the sky and so it was time to leave anyway. On the way home, happily eating his snack of cookies, Riku told me he would like to go to his house. He asked if Mari would be there, and his Daddy and Mommy, and Mirei too; they all would be soon, no doubt, and of course we knew Akane and Mirei were there, so I dropped him off at home. He knows we are going to the museum tomorrow, and had told me several times on the way home about seeing the "water beds and lily pads" there. </p>
<p>While Doug was at class, I made myself a big bowl of miso soup with added greens and tofu. I was feeling pretty good about this healthy meal and decided to top it off with a <strong>whole</strong> coconut chocolate bar! Not so healthy, but it sure was good. I sat and watched one and a half taped Oprah shows, relaxing and enjoying my chocolate. Yum! </p>
<p>I had been busy with the laundry in between other events today, and so continued with that while answering emails, and washing up the sand toys and the sticky bag I carry them in. As soon as Doug came home we went up to continue on with catching up on our taped shows, as we are well behind in them all. However, tired of not seeing any progress in the paper pile on the kitchen counters, I took up two big stacks and worked my way through them, feeling much better about watching TV and getting lots done at the same time. Bed at midnight after catching up on a couple more emails.</p>
