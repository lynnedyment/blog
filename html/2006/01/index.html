								<h2><a href="/2006/01/niagara_falls_to_toronto_2.html">Niagara Falls to Toronto</a></h2>
								<p>Despite my assuring Uncle Frank this morning at 3 a.m. that I would no doubt be awake before 9:30 without benefit of an alarm, I woke up at 10:20! Ah well, we both needed that seven and a half hours sleep and I didn't feel the least bit guilty about it. However, it did mean I had to hustle and get showered, finish my bit of packing, make poached eggs and toast for our breakfast (and banana and juice), as well as do some fast trotting back and forth to the garage with the big recycling container, the garbage, the propane stove for Paul, and all the mail I had hoped to attend to with Uncle Frank, not leaving it for him to do. Alas, Uncle Frank said he would take care of it all after dropping me at the bus station for the 12:30 bus to Toronto. </p>
<p>Just as we were pulling out of the driveway, Rick and Candy drove in. Candy had forgotten an envelope of photos and was there to pick them up from the mailbox. Lovely to say goodbye to them both once more before they headed back to Ottawa. </p>
<p>I worked on Candy's scarf all the way to Toronto; the bus filled up to capacity in St. Catherines but I was tucked into a window seat and found it easy to concentrate on the knitting. It's looking good and I was so pleased as one more day will finish it off. </p>
<p>Kelly picked me up at 2:30; she had a couple of errands to run and I had her stop at "The Big Carrot" for a few containers of my favourite foods there (tofu, tofu, and tofu, prepared three different ways, and some hummus too... yum!) before continuing on to pick Bryn and Caillie from Jacob and Jamie Lee's dad's place. </p>
<p>Once I was in the house I had a houseful of children all anxious to while away the afternoon and evening playing board games. I was more than happy to oblige and we had great fun, with the children taking turns choosing what we would play. We started off with Candyland, Caillie's choice, next came "Fear Factor", went on to Junior Monopoly (no, I didn't know how many eggs dinosaurs lay!), and played "Smart Mouth" with Bryant, a game we had played with his Dedo (Grandfather Tilston) on Christmas day. </p>
<p>I had nibbled away on my tofu feast during the games so by dinner time didn't need another bite; usually I clean the kitchen after dinner but was so tired and relaxed I didn't even go in and get to it. Kelly is happy to let them wait 'til morning and I was more than happy to not budge once the children were in bed and I sat knitting. The scarf is coming along beautifully; one more day should do it! </p>
<p>Kelly, Gregg, and I sat watching TV for a couple of hours after the children were tucked in. I answered a couple of emails but am so far behind that once again I am feeling that I will never catch up. I just need one full day but it isn't going to happen this trip either. Not that I really expect it too; it's far too much fun spending time with everyone. </p>
<p>Wiki is ready for bed by 10:30 or earlier and if we are up, she thinks it is still time to play. So, we all headed up at 10:30, with me not quite ready for sleep yet. However, Caillie was facing the wall when I crawled in with her, so I put my pillows up, turned on the light and read until 11:30 p.m. Loving the Amy Tan book I'm reading right now so it's not hard to stay awake longer than usual.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/01/visitors_and_another_busy_day.html">Visitors, and Another Busy Day Passes By</a></h2>
								<p>Ah, what a lazybones I am here! Caillie and I both slept until 10:10 this morning and then lay about in bed for another half hour, chatting and back-drawing as we always do when there is time. Caillie asked me first thing what I had dreamt, and then told me her dreams. Not too many people care to hear this in my life, so it's fun for both of us. </p>
<p>However, once up we both really had to get moving as we were all leaving for the dentist at 11:40. Bryant and Myk' have appointments, and Bryn has had a popcorn kernel stuck in his lower gum since yesterday. He is in obvious pain and Kelly wanted the dentist to have a look at it. I took my knitting along, determined to finish the scarf up today, and did well with it since there is only one dentist and she saw all three children. No cavities! </p>
<p>On our way back to the car we stopped for one of Doug's and my favourite Toronto treats... veggie hot dogs grilled by street vendors. Bryn is not a fan but he was hungry enough that he had one too, along with Kelly and me. The other three children had regular hot dogs and Myk' was salivating as she had to wait a half hour after her fluoride treatment before eating hers. She was happy to reach the car and dig in! </p>
<p>The children talked Kelly into having chocolate fondue for dessert tonight. We were dashing home to be there when Sherri, Kelly's high school friend, arrived with her three and five year olds. Perfect timing as they had just pulled up after we did, complete with lots of fresh fruit we dashed in to pick up on the way home. </p>
<p>It was a very relaxing afternoon. The children went off to their rooms playing, or gathered around the computer for a while playing various games. We three adults just ignored the noise and confusion and sat chatting in the living room. I was knitting, and we caught up on our news. I showed Sherri some of the photos of Mirei of course, and she told us about plans to move to a smaller home in Sudbury. </p>
<p>Gregg put dinner on the table as usual, and as usual it was delicious. Kelly had made squash risotto two nights before, and the adults had that with a salad while the children enjoyed their spaghetti. Kelly made a wondeful salad for us, following Gregg's instructions, she told me later, to add walnuts, apple, and feta cheese to the mixed greens. Yum! </p>
<p>We took a little break from the table, while Kelly cut up the fruit and I tidied up the dishes. Soon we were dipping expensive and delicious strawberries, pears, apples, bananas, and tiny marshmallows (the children) into liquid Toblerone chocolate with nuts, mixed with some wonderful semi-sweet chocolate. It was so good, and even though I wasn't at all hungry I was very happy with this wonderful dessert. We had it last year while in the Manitoulin and I enjoyed it every bit as much this time. Missed our traditional cheese fondue this year, so it hardly seemed reasonable to miss out on the chocolate fondue as well. </p>
<p>The children were all very excited playing together and Ava and Matti kept begging for just a "few more minutes" before leaving for their hotel in Burlington. Our four older children were obviously all ready for bed at 9 p.m. when they left, and Caillie was still awake at 10:10 p.m., settling down shortly after that. </p>
<p>I had finished the last of the clean-up, and sat down with Gregg to finish off the scarf and watch TV. A few hours earlier I had asked Kelly and Sherri if they thought the scarf was long enough; Kelly suggested I finish off the bit of yarn I had left, while Sherri suggested I cast off. I should have listened to her as when I went to pick it up I found all the stitches of this very difficult-to-work with yarn off the needles! Argggh!!! Bryant told me that Matti had picked it up and moved it around; he had told him not to touch it but obviously by then it was too late. Ah well, that will teach me to leave it lying on the sofa and not putting it away somewhere safe. I read recently that knitting is very relaxing and lowers the blood pressure, and as this is about the ninth time I have had to re-knit it I must have the lowest blood pressure going! </p>
<p>Bedtime for the adults not much after 10:30 p.m. Night night...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/01/a_quiet_thursday_evening.html">A Quiet Thursday Evening...</a></h2>
								<p>Well, here I sit all alone, a very rare occurence for the longest time, so thought it was a good time to get back to blogging. It's 8 p.m. on a Thursday evening in Toronto. Kelly is teaching a CM class, and Gregg and the children are at a neighbourhood meeting for another hour. I'll type as quickly as I can, and try my hardest to catch up on the past few days, while I still remember them! For the weeks before this, I have made some notes and shall try to do blog entries for the most important ones, such as the couple of days before Mirei was born! </p>
<p>Caillie and I woke at 9:15 this morning and then lay in bed for another hour, telling each other our dreams (one I remembered is that a bag of raisins I was taking on a trip, and left in a hallway at the airport while fetching my passport, was deemed to be a threat and carried away in a bomb-safe container! ... interpret that!), drawing pictures on each other's backs, to try to guess what they were, and ending with "five in a bed and the little one said... " (three were stuffed animals). </p>
<p>I just had time to shower quickly, check my email, and make some toast and "fakin' bacon" (as Gregg calls it) for Caillie and me, before dashing out the door with Bryn for an early lunch at Movenpick. We hadn't had time for our lunch out alone together in the fall and thought this would be a good day to do so. However, as Bryn pointed out on the subway, we were only going to have a half hour to gulp down our pizza and shared rosti before leaving to meet Kelly and the other children at the movies. We nixed that idea, and settled for a quick Subway sandwich for Bryn; we will try again tomorrow. </p>
<p>"Narnia" was wonderful; I loved it and so did the others. In fact, Bry' and Myk' had seen it already and wanted to see it again. We ate popcorn and drank pop, put our feet up and enjoyed it all thoroughly. </p>
<p>Once home, Bry' asked if I wanted to get started on his and Bryn's room. He was the first to ask so as soon as he finished piano practice, he, Bryn, and I got busy. It took a good two-plus hours but it looked great once we got rid of all the Christmas gift packaging, did a little flinging, and sorting. There were a lot of children in all their rooms before and after the holidays so they really did need help to sort it all out again. Looks great, with just a few shelves to clear and dust. Tomorrow I will tackle either Caillie's or Myk's with them. </p>
<p>We go to bed early around, here which is a blessing really. Wiki is ready to sleep around 10:30 but not if there are adults around to play with, so we will be heading upstairs for my third night before midnight. This works well for me, and I will be well rested when I head to the Falls again on Sunday! </p>
<p>Chatted with Candy tonight by phone once everyone had left the house, tried to call Gail but she and Tom are out, and Skyped with Doug as well. Lots of Christmas cards, so it was fun to hear what mail had arrived while Doug was here. Hoping to Skype with Bryn and perhaps Riku too. Must get Susan signed on this machine and perhaps I can say hello to Amelia too... not that the house is usually quiet enough to hear anyone! What a busy household this is! The two dogs are sleeping right now, but wouldn't be if the children were here to engage them in more fun things to do.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/01/just_call_me_toddler_tamer.html">Just Call Me "Toddler Tamer"!</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn left for school early this morning and Kelly went off at 8:35 with Caillie, leaving me to finish up my morning routine here. Kelly does call-back at the school on Fridays at 9:30, so I had time to putter about, answer a few emails, and grab a bite to eat before she picked me up at 10 a.m. </p>
<p>We had a few hours together downtown, which was such a treat, as it so rarely happens. We went bra shopping together for me, something I just don't take the time for on my own, bought some books, and finished off with a delicious lunch at La Commensal, a restaurant we both enjoy so much. Tofu, tofu, and more tofu, with some cooked greens for me and a selection of various goodies for Kelly; neither of had leftovers today! </p>
<p>I had plans to spend the afternoon with Liz Lawless, so Kelly and I got on the subway together and I got off at Bay Street to meet Liz at Indigo Books. We walked from there to Sarah's house, enjoying the beautiful homes in Rosedale along the way. The day couldn't have been better for a walk; not too warm and not cold or windy either: a perfect spring-like day. </p>
<p>We stopped in at Jerry's and Liz's little pied-a-terre in the city first, to say hello to Jerry and have a cold drink before leaving for Sarah's and Rob's. It was lovely to see Sarah, who is always so welcoming; the baby Callum, whom I've been seeing photos online of since he was born seven months ago, is just adorable, with big brown eyes and perfect eyebrows. Sarah left to pick up Aidan from daycare, and we had time to chat and admire Callum. </p>
<p>Aidan is a sweetheart with a big smile, but shy at first. He thoroughly enjoyed looking over the Caillou book I had bought for him, a peek-a-boo book which Riku likes so much at this age too. We did some of a floor puzzle together but had to dash off soon after Sarah came down from tucking in Callum. </p>
<p>On the walk to the subway, Liz told me that she thought that Aidan would have had a full blown outburst if I hadn't been there; he wanted his mother while she was busy with the baby, and instead we had a fun half hour together. Liz told me I should hang up my shingle! How nice...</p>
<p>I arrived home at 6 p.m. in the rain, after a subway ride from St. Clair West. We, all seven of us, had plans to go out for dinner at Sakawaya, a Japanese restaurant on the Danforth. This is to be Caillie and Bryn's birthday dinner out, courtesy of Gregg and Kelly; the two children wanted to have all of us experience the restaurant they discovered with their Dad some time ago. They are regulars there and Bryn has discovered a favourite dish... tomago, an egg dish. </p>
<p>We arrived shortly after 6:30 and left after 8 p.m. We all enjoyed our dinners, but the service was very erratic; I had all three of my dishes immediately, and Bryn's didn't arrive until almost 8 p.m.! He ordered a bowl of rice to keep him going as he was so hungry by the time he got the two servings of his dish; they didn't any left of the third one he had ordered. Bryn is growing so fast and is eating bigger and bigger portions of everything these days. He had tasted a little bit of several other dishes too but I'm sure would have eaten more than he ordered. </p>
<p>I had three dishes... two brochettes of tofu and mixed vegetables, agadashi tofu, and deep fried cheese which got shared with all the children. Yum! I would have liked it better if the service had been better; next time we will go at a much slower time, although we were the second table seated as it was.  </p>
<p>We all walked home in the very mild evening air; the children got ready for bed almost immediately, and we adults had a typical evening... I was mending, Kelly was relaxing watching tv with me, and Gregg was busy at the computer... not typical for him, but he was working late today. Lights out for me at 12:15 a.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/01/its_the_weekend_2.html">It's the Weekend!</a></h2>
								<p>.. as Riku would say. Caillie and I awoke at 8:20 with enough time for me to draw a few pictures on her back. I wrote to Uncle Frank and Carol Woods; no other emails for me, so I guess everyone is fed up waiting for me to write! </p>
<p>As soon as I was dressed and downstairs, later than I thought it would be, Bryn and I started cutting out and decorating gingerbread men; I did the cutting while Bryn put in the eyes, nose, mouth, and belt in the same way we have been doing for years. I have made gingerbread with both Bryn and Caillie every year since they have been old enough to stir the batter. </p>
<p>The house smelled wonderful when we left at 11:30 for the Science Centre, and each of the children, and a couple of the adults too, enjoyed a soft, warm, tiny gingerbread man on the way out of the house. </p>
<p>There is a much-talked-about exhibit at the Science Centre called Body Works 2. It consists of bodies, and body parts, from cadavers which have been plasticized. It is a controversial process, but was incredibly interesting, and not at all disturbing to any of us in any negative way. The children were all bored before the adults had completely finished it, but all showed interest in different things. We saw complete body parts, bodies "stopped" in mid-motion, showing the muscles in action, and everything from babies in the womb to side slices of obese adults with their layers of fat. </p>
<p>We spent a full two hours at the exhibit, after first having seen a wonderful IMAX film called "The Mysteries of the Nile", which took us on a trip down the Blue Nile River, a trip full of adventure and misadventure, by an intrepid group of voyagers, not all professional kayakers or rafters. We all thoroughly enjoyed this. </p>
<p>At 5:30 we headed home, with piano practice for two of the children, and homework for them all before dinner. I made a big mug of hot tea, and relaxed in the master bedroom while Kelly checked her email and Gregg made us all nice big bowls of manicotti with red wine for the grownups. We're all feeling lazy and relaxed from all the walking and the cold dash back to the car.</p>
<p>Gail IM'd suggesting we catch up by phone, so as soon as dinner was over I took the rest of my wine upstairs, stretched out on the bed, and had a nice long chat with my sister.</p>
<p>Time for my evening mending while watching TV with Kelly; Gregg stuck his nose in now and then to take a peek with us, but was busy once again on the computer. </p>
<p>The weather has turned from spring-like to winter cold, with a high wind-chill factor and low temps. Brrr, Caillie and I will be snuggling up tonight! </p>
<p>Bedtime... 11:40. I can feel the cold air already!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/01/riku_time_and_mirei_is_one_mon.html">Riku Time... and Mirei is One Month Old!</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke nice and early this morning, at 7 a.m., so down I went to check emails. The backlog is overwhelming, but I shall get through them sooner or later. </p>
<p>As soon as I had showered, I got busy sorting through the big stack of Christmas cards on my kitchen counter. Doug had told me, when I was in Japan, which ones had come in, but there had been some in during the past two weeks as well. I read each and every one, taking a few minutes to write email thank you messages for a few special ones. </p>
<p>Doug went off to his T'ai Chi class at 9:40 and I had soon had the entire kitchen table covered with various piles of cards. I miss opening them during the holidays, but they are no less special when viewed for the first time in mid-January either. </p>
<p>At 11:30 Bryn dropped Riku off... a tired, jet-lagged boy. He had not been happy sharing his toys with Amelia, who was over for a visit with her parents to meet Mirei. Bryn said he was ready for a good nap and more food so we got busy with both. First, however, Riku was more than happy to sit and play with the clay Susan has temporarily donated to the Dyment household for the children's amusement. Riku thoroughly enjoys sitting and digging into the clay/sand, making hills and balls, and running his little tractor into it to make tracks and bulldoze over his structures. </p>
<p>I fed him a big bowl of oatmeal with blueberries while he played; he ate every bite, and then helped me make fresh orange juice. He's a big boy and knew he couldn't touch the sharp knife but could put his hand on mine while the electric juicer went around and around. All of the grandchildren have loved watching the juice fall into the glass, and of course they have all enjoyed drinking it too. </p>
<p>Riku napped for two full hours. Once again I saw him smiling in his sleep, the sweetest thing. What lovely dreams he must have! </p>
<p>He went right back to the clay box after he woke, and I took advantage of his busy hands to feed him again. He had asked for "bacon, eggs, and toast" and ate three slices of "bacon", all the rest of his breakfast, plus a half banana and lots of strawberries while I prepared the hot food. </p>
<p>Off we went to the playground at 4:20; it was still light out, and there was a weak stream of sunshine at this point. Riku was in his stroller, snacking on cookies and juice, just like the "old days", happily chatting about what we were seeing along the way. He was delighted that the playground was still open; I had warned him that it might not be. I had forgotten his sand toys but he played so happily with a brightly coloured ball, finding various adults who would kick it back to him, and a little girl who rescued it each time it went too far, and would bring it back to him. </p>
<p>The playground closed at 5:25 today and we walked home. Riku was sad and cried a little when we had to leave, but once home invited me into his room to play. Mirei had just nursed and was wide awake, so I held her on my lap as Bryn played with his Daddy on the floor with us. </p>
<p>Mirei is amazing; she smiles so readily. She has the tiniest little mouth when she purses it up; Bryn told me she does this a lot, but if you just make a clicking sound, she looks up and starts smiling a very big smile. She pays such attention to your face and seems to respond to every little change with that smile of hers. I had Bryn take a little video of her while she was doing this, and it is just adorable. We sat, getting to know each other, with Riku coming over for occasional kisses and snuggles with his sister. He's very gentle with her, and talks to her when he leans over for a kiss. </p>
<p>I left reluctantly at 6:30; holding a baby is the best! Bryn was getting Riku's dinner ready, in preparation for his normal bedtime, and Doug was no doubt waiting for his dinner too. We ate Japanese for dinner, courtesy of Susan, who had spoiled us yet again with a big bag of it a couple of days ago. The food was delicious as we shared five inari, big chunks of agedashi tofu, and a dark green vegetable called aji nanohana. I had polished off the kabocha salad for my lunch today. Yum! </p>
<p>The evening passed quickly... another TV show, shared the new Coke flavour, black cherry vanilla (too sweet for my taste), and then lots of time going through the photos of Japan (over 500 of them when we finished; more editing still to come!), and turned out the light at 1 a.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/01/another_beautiful_day.html">Another Beautiful Day!</a></h2>
								<p>It was lovely having Riku here with me from the time he opened his eyes in the morning. What a happy face to waken to! We cuddled for a bit, playing his latest favourite "game", pretending we are birds in a nest. Susan and Amelia have been playing this for some time, and since Riku loves the book "Are You My Mother", we have taken it up too, following their lead. The pillows are already laid out in a nest-like pattern, and from our cozy perch, we take turns peeping at each other and feeding the other pretend "worms". Riku is such a good mommy, and leans over me, very close to my mouth, to drop in the yummy pretend morsel he has collected for me. We read the book after we're finished and then it's time to get up! </p>
<p>Riku ate a <strong>huge</strong> amount of food this morning; he started off with two small bowls of fruit, bananas and sliced strawberries, with a cup of freshly squeezed orange juice. He is now completely toilet trained, waking with a dry diaper(!), and letting me know when "urine is coming!" or dashing towards the bathroom, calling out "BM!" </p>
<p>I dressed him and had him upstairs to see his very first episode of "Caillou" on our PBS station at 8:30 a.m. I wish I had had a camera to record that little face as it lit up seeing one of his current favourites "live". This was a great first episode too, as Caillou's grandpa was on the program, and of course his mommy, daddy, and baby sister Rosie too. I sat beside him as he beamed away, listening to Caillou not wanting to go to the playgroup, and wanting to go on a school bus for the first time. </p>
<p>He ate his full breakfast as soon as that was over... chose scrambled eggs and ate two of them, just more than a half slice of toast, and two pieces of "bacon". Following that, he played with his new white Play-Doh, enjoying the new cutters I bought in Japan, then his "clay" box, and finally spending over an hour in the garden with me, where we swept and pulled weeds. Riku had his big "Caterpillar" truck outside too, but was more interested in sweeping, and collecting the big sticks from the flower beds. The annuals are starting to bloom with the hyacinths already showing some pink tips. It was so sunny and warm out and we both just had light jackets on, undone. </p>
<p>Today we continued on in the very funny vein of "pretend" language we started yesterday. It was hilarious and Riku started it up today. We just talk gibberish to each other, but use a real sounding rhythm of language. He would say something along the lines of "Abba ca dough me?" and I would reply "shumo darbo eeky no" and on and on we would go, with exclamations, and questions, and lots of emphasis in various places, often ending with a big laugh, as though we both got the joke. What astounds both Doug and me is how quickly he caught on to all of this; he knows it's all pretend and yet can carry it on and on, coming up with all sorts of great pretend words. It's so funny and such fun! </p>
<p>Doug and Akane went off to Costco at 12:30. Akane had walked over with Mirei in the sling, and Mirei was fast asleep when Akane put her down on the sofa. Riku had had his lunch... some noodles and veggies, and then a yogurt, so I got him tucked into bed by 12:50, hoping to have some cuddle time with Mirei. However, it didn't happen; she just slept and slept and slept, looking very peaceful and in a deep sleep, with her arms over her head. My Mom always said this was the sign of a contented baby, and contented she was, for the next almost two hours! </p>
<p>I prepared a snack for Riku to take along to Ocean Beach with us (he napped for just one hour today), and Mirei woke in just enough time for me to hold her for two minutes, while Doug put the sling on to walk her home. Of course the minute Doug started to walk with her, Mirei was asleep again! What a very easy baby she is. I took photos of her sleeping, and have lots of these! </p>
<p>Riku and I were at the beach by 3:20. It was warmer than yesterday, and Riku settled in with his sand toys. The two big "mountains" from yesterday were gone, but we dug down for some wet sand and made a few cakes and shapes while waiting for Amelia and Susan to arrive. A little girl and her mom joined us when we first sat down, and she and Riku sat side by side, filling up containers. </p>
<p>We had almost an hour with Susan and Amelia; mostly they sat playing, while Susan built sand castles from the bucket, for each of them to knock down in turns. Not long before we had to leave, Riku started collecting feathers and sticks, and the two children went off down the beach on their own for an amble. </p>
<p>It was such fun to have both children there with me; Amelia insisted on carrying the big bag of sand toys all by herself all the way up the stairs from the beach to the car. What a girl!</p>
<p>Doug had his T'ai Chi class tonight, so I had to have the car home for him by 5:30. The sun was getting lower in the sky and so it was time to leave anyway. On the way home, happily eating his snack of cookies, Riku told me he would like to go to his house. He asked if Mari would be there, and his Daddy and Mommy, and Mirei too; they all would be soon, no doubt, and of course we knew Akane and Mirei were there, so I dropped him off at home. He knows we are going to the museum tomorrow, and had told me several times on the way home about seeing the "water beds and lily pads" there. </p>
<p>While Doug was at class, I made myself a big bowl of miso soup with added greens and tofu. I was feeling pretty good about this healthy meal and decided to top it off with a <strong>whole</strong> coconut chocolate bar! Not so healthy, but it sure was good. I sat and watched one and a half taped Oprah shows, relaxing and enjoying my chocolate. Yum! </p>
<p>I had been busy with the laundry in between other events today, and so continued with that while answering emails, and washing up the sand toys and the sticky bag I carry them in. As soon as Doug came home we went up to continue on with catching up on our taped shows, as we are well behind in them all. However, tired of not seeing any progress in the paper pile on the kitchen counters, I took up two big stacks and worked my way through them, feeling much better about watching TV and getting lots done at the same time. Bed at midnight after catching up on a couple more emails.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/01/bay_area_discovery_museum_day.html">Bay Area Discovery Museum Day!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku was looking forward to this day, talking about "water beds and lily pads" a few times yesterday, and it was a perfect day for it. Bryn dropped him off at 9 a.m. today, and we left the house at 9:45, with a lunch packed, snacks organized, and a happy boy in the back seat. We arrived at Ashbury Street at 10 a.m. and let Susan and Amelia lead the way across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausilito. </p>
<p>First stop, the meandering "stream" with lots of plastic fish, turtles, and a toad. Amelia likes to collect lots of them in her arms, and Riku likes to drop his under the little waterfall. They spent a happy half hour or more at this favourite activity, and then stopped to do some writing on blackboards with chalk as we left that area. Nothing was cuter than to see the two of them sitting side by side drawing away; Amelia did lots of lines today, and Riku seems to be into a new filled-in "round" stage. </p>
<p>From there we went into the painting/craft area where they were just in time for two cleaned-off pieces of glass for painting. Riku enjoys using the sprayer and then watching the lines of water dribble down through the paint he applied first; Amelia did lots of brightly coloured splotches before applying the vivid orange to her lips, hands, and arms! They had a great time and were ready to move on to something new within twenty minutes. </p>
<p>Amelia sat at the "clay" table, while Riku re-discovered the magnetic squares. He and Doug had used these together on a previous trip; he was obviously pleased to have so many to himself as only one other child was using them today. He joined Amelia on the other side of the clay table; they both squeezed, and rolled, and mounded the clay into various shapes, and much to our surprise happily gave it up when we told them it was lunch time. </p>
<p>Off we went to the cafe; Susan and I had panini sandwiches with mixed greens. Amelia shared the grilled cheese with Susan, while Riku ate the eggs and fruit I had packed for him, followed by a few cookies, including a new favourite chocolate-topped one of Doug's. It was busy inside the lunch room, but it was easier than trying to keep them away from the more exciting activities available from the outside tables. </p>
<p>Both children were tired and so we took a little time out for the boat and crow's nest before leaving at 1 p.m. We never did make it to the room with the water beds or "ponds" with the lily pads, so we must go back again soon. It was a lovely day, our last before the rain starts again. </p>
<p>Riku amazingly did not fall asleep immediately (Bryn told me he had a restless night, woke up at 6 a.m. with a dry diaper, needing to go to the bathroom! and then went back to sleep for an hour). However, he was almost asleep when we were just five minutes from home; I passed back the rest of his snacks which just managed to keep him occupied until we got in the driveway. </p>
<p>I set the timer for five minutes of free time (this is working well for Riku since November; he likes knowing the timer will let him know when it's bedtime) and he sat and drew before it was time for a Franklin story and tuck-in. </p>
<p>It took him a long time to settle in and he napped finally from 2-3 p.m. That is the second one hour nap in two days, short for what he usually has; Bryn mentioned later that Riku would have napped longer if I had been in with him, but I don't want to do that. He needs to sleep on his own, and I need the time to myself while he naps. (Later Susan told me that Amelia too had not napped in the car on the way home, and then slept for only forty-five minutes... must be something in the air today!). </p>
<p>We snuggled for a long time, leaning up against all the pillows for three stories. He rediscovered the "Franklin" books today which he liked so much last fall. </p>
<p>Then Riku was ready to play cars, and "crashing cars" on his bed with me. Every car came out of the basket and we had a grand ol' time sorting and crashing and fixing; some of them needed a "garage" and so we used a big wooden flat car for that purpose. We worked a new puzzle on the bed after he played for a bit with the clay box here in the kitchen. Then off we went back into his room, for "clean up" of the cars. </p>
<p>I am still looking for his favourite dog, which has disappeared since yesterday, and so while digging through the stuffed animal basket, discovered the big white mouse puppet that Jody had given him almost two years ago. He was delighted to see it again, and so we had such fun with that, and the tiny white stuffed toy mouse we have had for years. Riku hid him behind and under the bed, right in the corner, and then we had to "find him", using the flashlight Gail and Tom gave him for his birthday. I turned out the light in the bedroom to make it more exciting when the light fell on the little white mouse "hiding" in the corner. Each time Riku reunited the baby with her mommy, they had to snuggle and kiss; he is very loving with his "animals". </p>
<p>Riku had the rest of his strawberries and bananas when he first woke up, and a little later a half container of yogurt too. He weighed in at 31 pounds at the doctor's on Monday, not a big heavy boy by any means, but his cheeks and chin are looking quite chunky these days and he has a nice roundy little body and legs too. </p>
<p>Mirei went off with Akane for her first check-up here in the States, and then had to go for a genetic test of some kind. Hope to hear more about what this was for later on.... </p>
<p>Bryn was picking Riku up before 6 p.m. and as Riku had spotted the photo of the drawaing Susan had made of a dog using chalk on the sidewalk outside here, Riku decided that should be our next activity. Off we went outside to wait for Bryn, with lots of time for drawing, making numbers, and trying to see the cat across the street. It was just dusk and Riku enjoyed being outside listening to the planes, the dogs barking, some sirens and watching the buses as they passed by. Bryn joined us, drew a robot for Riku after admiring our drawings, and off they went. Riku wrapped his arms around Bryn when he got out of the car and said "I missed you <strong>so</strong> much!". The feeling was mutual and Bryn told him so. </p>
<p>Quick dinner for Doug and me... "chicken" burgers and some carrot sticks, and up we went to watch one of our NetFlix movies. It was a light comedy and I fell asleep as Doug rubbed my back and shoulders. I woke up in time to see the happy ending! </p>
<p>Bedtime early tonight... lots to do tomorrow.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/01/no_more_naps.html">"No More Naps!"</a></h2>
								<p>Riku has become very opinionated these past couple of weeks about his needs and wants. He was busy today after lunch, and I told him I was setting the timer for five minutes until his nap. He held up his hands and in a very firm authoritative voice pronounced "No more naps!" It made me laugh out loud as he sounded very serious about it, and I'm sure he was! </p>
<p>He knows without a doubt what colour Play-Doh he is going to use each time. "Green". "White". No second thoughts, no changing his mind. Once he has announced the colour off he goes to get it. And it's interesting that he never ever plays with two at a time either. </p>
<p>When I ask if he would like an egg for breakfast, for instance, he will tell me exactly what he wants. He still often uses the third person and will say "Riku want an egg, bacon, no toast" and the hand goes up to make it clear that toast is not to be given. </p>
<p>I often give him a choice as to what he could choose for lunch... mac' and cheese, or noodle soup, egg and bacon or porridge. He always knows and states his choice clearly. If I ask him if he wants more he will often say "no, I okay", or "no, Riku fine" with a serious nodding of his head, furrowed brow and all. </p>
<p>Riku seems to waken from his nap knowing exactly what he wants to do; it could be drawing, or making me a meal in his kitchen, making "toilet paper" out of Play-Doh, playing with his animals in the sink or using the clay box from Auntie Susan. He knows the latter is Amelia's and he knows we are just borrowing it, but once in a while he likes to see if I have forgotten that, and will tell me it is his claybox... and then checks the look on my face, taking notice of my raised eyebrows and smiling at me.  </p>
<p>Last week we discovered, on our walk from his house to ours, a piece of sidewalk filled with the most interesting bits... smooshed slugs, dog bm, cat bm, and worms, often stepped on worms, and the newly discovered gum pieces. It was a long slow block home that day! The next day I suggested we go down one block earlier just for a change and I was nixed... "No slugs down there, no bm, we go this way!" Okay! I'm happy to please, when it takes so little effort to make this  boy happy.</p>
