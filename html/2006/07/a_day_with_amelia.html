								<h2>A Day with Amelia</h2>
								<p>This was a perfectly wonderful day, as I had a Amelia with me for a full day, from before 8:30 'til after 5:30. This is a rare treat, since I usually have her after nursery school for half days. She had her head buried in her daddy's shoulder when he rang the bell, but within a minute or two, she was happily climbing the stairs with me to wave goodbye to him and find her "baby". We also noticed that Sutro Tower had disappeared in a blanket of fog, although it's sunny on this part of the city.</p>
<p>We had a little snuggle on a chair in the living room, and talked about our upcoming plane trips; she told me she is going to wear her PJs on the plane to Alaska. Not quite ready to eat, Amelia got busy in the "kitchen", making a big tower of the plastic tea cups, and getting Doug over to admire it as well. I found a basket for her two babies, put a blanket in to make it soft and cover them with, and Amelia happily walked around the house chatting to her babies and fussing with them. She's such a good mommy! </p>
<p>We all had breakfast together; she had had a snack before coming over and had insisted she wasn't hungry when she first arrived. However, she ate some toast, cherries (a few helpings of these; she likes them as much as we do), and lots of juice. Before going off to the playground on 20th Street, she had Doug read a little "Dick and Jane" story to her. Of course she had him engaged as he sat at the computer too, showing her the spider she likes so much and chatting with him.</p>
<p>I brought both Amelia and Riku gardening gloves back from BC, and Amelia spent a little time in the garden trying hers out, lifting heavy rocks and putting them in the wheelbarrow.  </p>
<p>Off to the playground for an hour and a half; Amelia met a new friend called Samantha. She and Amelia just hit it off, and played ever so nicely together for the full time there. They ran around, climbed on the playground equipment, sat in the sandbox briefly, and ended off their time by taking turns pushing each other around on a tricycle with a long handle attached. Amelia is <strong>strong</strong> and even when Sam' wasn't peddling, she struggled to keep her moving! She's an amazing little girl, is our Amelia! </p>
<p>She cried a little bit when we had to leave, but it was obvious she was a tired girl. I assured her we would have lunch and a story first, and of course she was just fine. We all had lunch together, and Amelia ate all of the mac' and cheese with broccoli that her mom had sent over, plus more fruit and juice. Tuck-in was a breeze... one story and Amelia was asleep before I could finish off all the verses to "The Wheels on the Bus". It was very sweet as she asked if I would sleep with her; the last time she asked she told me that I "<em>didn't</em> sleep with children", and seemed to accept this easily again today. I told her I had work to do, and that was the end of that. Her little body relaxed and gave in and she napped for just over an hour and a half, waking happily and calling out she was awake now. </p>
<p>This afternoon, after her snack, we washed our hands and got busy making banana bread together. What a treat this was, as she was very serious about the whole project, mashing the bananas with vigour, beating in the eggs, carefully pouring in the oil, adding the flour and baking soda, tipping in the milk and vanilla, and stirring away happily, holding on to the edge of the bowl. She helped spoon the batter into the pan, and then happily used the spatula to polish off the bits of batter left there for her. </p>
<p>Rather than go out again, we spent the rest of our day at home, reading every lift-the-flap book we could find... we have lots!, and while I did some tidying up in the kitchen, Amelia sat working on puzzles. I joined her for the ABC puzzle and she happily recited to me all the words that being with a particular letter; she and her mom have been doing this at home and it was fun to hear her double letters and learning new ones too. Usually we spend some time upstairs, but today Amelia was happy to wander about playing with one thing after another. </p>
<p>Susan came by bearing many gifts... two bouquets of beautiful flowers!... whites and creams, deep purples, and purple thistle, which really set them all off. I love them. And of course there was food... organic strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries, along with two tubs of wonderful puddings... one a dark Belgium chocolate pudding, and two imported chocolate bars. </p>
<p>After waving goodbye, I quickly made a "chicken" burger up for Doug with all the trimmings, and cut my burger up into a big bowl of mixed greens. After dinner, we went up to watch a movie, but I found it boring, gave up half way through it, and came downstairs to answer some e-mails and annotate the photos of Amelia from today. They were just too cute to delay showing her mom and dad, and my sisters and Uncle Frank too! Amelia is such a sunny and happy little girl, and such a dear companion. </p>
<p>bed at 12:45... too late!</p>
