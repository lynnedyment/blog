								<h2>Thursday... One Week After Arriving Home From Ontario</h2>
								<p>And how that week has flown by! We've packed a lot in... two visits with Amelia, dinner out with Bryn and family, three pick-ups from school with Riku and the afternoons together after his naps, Doug's birthday celebration, and the Fourth of July too. The ironing still is waiting to be finished, and the paper pile still is piled higher than is ideal, but I'm getting there, just in time to leave for B.C. next week if I work hard at it. </p>
<p>I picked Amelia up from school at 12:20 and was greeted with a big smile and a big hug too. After hugging everyone goodbye we left for the afternoon here. Amelia's favourite "baby" here is a small snowman wearing a diaper and baby socks; she cuddled that as she drifted off to sleep after a "Thomas the Tank Engine" story. </p>
<p>After her one hour nap we sat on the bed and tossed a soft stuffed baby cow back and forth to each other, pretending to knock each other over. I did some ironing while she played with her other animals, and enjoyed her snack of old Canadian cheddar, chocolate alphabet biscuits ("A" is for Amelia, "H" is for house), and a banana. </p>
<p>Amelia quote of the day: When I asked her to put her "babies" away before we left the house, she turned to me and said "I hear you Nana". Makes me smile just to write this. I told Susan about it later on and she said it came about when she asked Amelia to just let her know when she had heard some instructions from her, so that she didn't have to repeat them to her. Amelia follows instructions well! </p>
<p>We met up with Riku and drove him to the playground with us, for an hour and a bit of sandbox and climbing time together. Akane and Mirei joined us not long after we arrived and Susan came along in time for a visit with her too. Mirei was napping for the first time today; the little walk to the park in the "pouch" knocked her out although that didn't work this morning when they went off to the studio. I had one big smile from her before she drifted off again. </p>
<p>Home at 5:30 as Doug needed the car for T'ai Chi; I ate popcorn for dinner and started going through boxes and files looking for my birth certificate. Bryn needs it for his U.K. passport application and I have no clue where it is hiding. I worked at it steadily even after Doug got home and watched a dark Scottish movie ("Ratcatcher") I had seen, thank goodness, many years ago with Bryn at a Toronto Film Festival. I was in no mood for depressing movies and I remembered clearly after just hearing the title how depressing it was. </p>
<p>Doug booked tickets today for my and Riku's flights to B.C. in early August. Nice to have that done; next on the agenda is to book for Ottawa/Toronto at the end of August. The summer is already disappearing too quickly! </p>
<p>Made a cheesecake this afternoon, a second one, as Amelia would like a piece, and no doubt Susan and Kevin would too. Of course Doug wants more, and Riku as well! </p>
<p>Lovely long email from Uncle Frank today; his physio is going very well and he is keeping very busy around the house as well. I do miss our evenings together, especially as we really did take the time to just relax and slow down. </p>
<p>Bed at 11:30...</p>
