								<h2><a href="/2006/07/thursday_one_week_after_arrivi.html">Thursday... One Week After Arriving Home From Ontario</a></h2>
								<p>And how that week has flown by! We've packed a lot in... two visits with Amelia, dinner out with Bryn and family, three pick-ups from school with Riku and the afternoons together after his naps, Doug's birthday celebration, and the Fourth of July too. The ironing still is waiting to be finished, and the paper pile still is piled higher than is ideal, but I'm getting there, just in time to leave for B.C. next week if I work hard at it. </p>
<p>I picked Amelia up from school at 12:20 and was greeted with a big smile and a big hug too. After hugging everyone goodbye we left for the afternoon here. Amelia's favourite "baby" here is a small snowman wearing a diaper and baby socks; she cuddled that as she drifted off to sleep after a "Thomas the Tank Engine" story. </p>
<p>After her one hour nap we sat on the bed and tossed a soft stuffed baby cow back and forth to each other, pretending to knock each other over. I did some ironing while she played with her other animals, and enjoyed her snack of old Canadian cheddar, chocolate alphabet biscuits ("A" is for Amelia, "H" is for house), and a banana. </p>
<p>Amelia quote of the day: When I asked her to put her "babies" away before we left the house, she turned to me and said "I hear you Nana". Makes me smile just to write this. I told Susan about it later on and she said it came about when she asked Amelia to just let her know when she had heard some instructions from her, so that she didn't have to repeat them to her. Amelia follows instructions well! </p>
<p>We met up with Riku and drove him to the playground with us, for an hour and a bit of sandbox and climbing time together. Akane and Mirei joined us not long after we arrived and Susan came along in time for a visit with her too. Mirei was napping for the first time today; the little walk to the park in the "pouch" knocked her out although that didn't work this morning when they went off to the studio. I had one big smile from her before she drifted off again. </p>
<p>Home at 5:30 as Doug needed the car for T'ai Chi; I ate popcorn for dinner and started going through boxes and files looking for my birth certificate. Bryn needs it for his U.K. passport application and I have no clue where it is hiding. I worked at it steadily even after Doug got home and watched a dark Scottish movie ("Ratcatcher") I had seen, thank goodness, many years ago with Bryn at a Toronto Film Festival. I was in no mood for depressing movies and I remembered clearly after just hearing the title how depressing it was. </p>
<p>Doug booked tickets today for my and Riku's flights to B.C. in early August. Nice to have that done; next on the agenda is to book for Ottawa/Toronto at the end of August. The summer is already disappearing too quickly! </p>
<p>Made a cheesecake this afternoon, a second one, as Amelia would like a piece, and no doubt Susan and Kevin would too. Of course Doug wants more, and Riku as well! </p>
<p>Lovely long email from Uncle Frank today; his physio is going very well and he is keeping very busy around the house as well. I do miss our evenings together, especially as we really did take the time to just relax and slow down. </p>
<p>Bed at 11:30...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/07/san_francisco_ca_to_corvallis.html">San Francisco, CA to Corvallis, OR</a></h2>
								<p>I had a very early start this morning, as I was awake and up at 5:30 A.M. ready to get started on our trip to Oregon! Despite being very well organized last night, bag packed, magazines and food ready to go, etc. we didn't leave the house until 8 o'clock. Just as well, as I had a leisurely morning, with time for emails, a long hot shower to waken me, and no rushing about... just the way a vacation should start. I even made a "bacon" sandwich and a thermos of tea for the road. </p>
<p>We filled up with gas in Fairfield, at $3.07 a gallon, as we didn't think we had enough to get us to Vacaville, where it is usually cheaper. Good thing too, as it was $3.22 a gallon there! We were on I-5 by 9:40, already sunny and hot. Throughout the day, we enjoyed several snacks that we had brought along: almonds, cold fresh Olsen's cherries, chocolate, and our mid-day Cokes.</p>
<p>By noon we were admiring the lovely Mt. Shasta and I was madly snapping photos out the car window. Passed by Soda Creek, a name that I find amusing... I have a mental image of bubbling water(!), and of course were delighted to pass by Castle Crags, a lovely outcropping of majestic rocks, reminiscent of a mountaintop castle. </p>
<p>At 12:30, we stopped in Weed, at a vegetarian restaurant Doug disovered for us on the Internet, called "Buddha's Belly". Yum! We had nice round tummies too, after sharing a cheesy tempeh "Reuben" sandwich and a veggie burger.. both for $12. I had all the sauerkraut and we both enjoyed the delicious mixed green salad served with them. The friendly counter gal filled up our water bottles with their untreated spring mountain water.</p>
<p>An hour later we were back on the road; it was quite hot by this time, but the open windows kept us comfortable. Traffic was moving very nicely for us, and we made much better time than we had anticipated. </p>
<p>Just north of Yreka, before leaving the state, we passed by two metal sculpures. One, of a huge bull, we had seen in the past, but this time decided we would be sure to stop and take a photo of it, which we did. Not much later, we passed a huge and wonderful dragon, and Doug backed the car up so we could get a photo of it as well. </p>
<p>At 2:30, near Ashland Oregon, I was taking photos of brown roundy hills and valleys, with the occasional field of bright yellow... mustard, perhaps? </p>
<p>We stopped for gas at Grant's Pass, Oregon, and were pleased to find it for $2.99. Hard to imagine that this high price would make us happy but we have been hard hit with high gas prices over the past year. </p>
<p>I was admiring the scenery and going through unread newspapers as well, so Doug got to hear a few interesting stories about a town in northeast Oregon that sounds well worth visiting one day, and all about a B&B ranch experience that sounds like a perfect spot for Susan and Kevin to get to in the future. Nothing like having a captive audience! </p>
<p>At last we saw the brown hills turning green and the trees getting taller! It rained for a bit here and there, and what a lovely smell that was, combined with newly cut hay but really just the distinctive smell of rain that is not city rain! How I miss that, and hadn't realized that I had. It was a treat in Ontario too, to see the skies darken and then a storm break out in the way it never does in San Francisco. </p>
<p>We arrived in Corvallis at 6 P.M., much earlier that we thought we would, and easily found another great vegetarian restaurant Doug had tracked down for us. This was called "Nearly Normal's", featuring "Gonzo Cuisine", and we were very pleased with our dinners: vegan manicotti for me, with artichoke hearts and a delicious fennel sauce, and a potato, chili, cheese enchilada for Doug, who finished off with a slice of key lime pie. Cost of dinner... $19.75</p>
<p>Checked into our Motel 6 at 7:30; it is really more of an inn, as all the doors are inside; we have a very large room with two double beds, nicely air-conditioned and with free Internet service too! Checking my mail, I found that Uncle Frank, Glenn, and Gail had all written, plus there were photos of Akane and Riku on the plane and Riku and Mirei with BahBah, Akane's mom. Bryn had written a wonderfully newsy blog all about their flight there and their settling into Akane's mom's home for their first sleep. </p>
<p>Doug and I are both tired after our short sleeps last night; he did most of the driving today and I took over the last three hours. Time for bed, after a few fresh strawberries... 10:30 P.M.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/07/corvallis_oregon_to_centralia.html">Corvallis, Oregon to Centralia, Washington</a></h2>
								<p>Awoke at 7 A.M., checked email while Doug showered... what a treat on the road! We shared a banana and ate our second half of the wonderful organic strawberries Susan had bought for our trip. We were on the road by 8 o'clock. Topped up our gas at $2.89 a gallon, as we assumed gas would be more expensive along the coast. It was. Headed for Newport, Oregon, along a winding road filled with tall trees and a slow driver in front of us; I quite enjoyed it as the morning was lovely and I sat anticipating a good breakfast on our arrival. </p>
<p>First, however, we drove along the bay road, stopping for a look at a charming lighthouse (not open for viewing until 11 A.M.), and also stopped at a memorial for fishermen and women lost at sea in this area. It was very touching, with personal letters from wives, children, and grandchildren, sitting on the stone memorial carved with so many names. </p>
<p>Marie had given me an article on this town, and Mo's was suggested as the place to eat in town. However, they were not open for breakfast, so we wandered along the main street of this fast-becoming-a-tourist destination --mupscale tourist shops, a shop for cat owners(!), etc. -- and decided on "The Whale's Tale", which looked as though it had been in business for a long time. It was a great spot, as they bake their own whole wheat bread each day as well as a different muffin each day of the week. Doug enjoyed his shrimp omelette as I did my overstuffed with cheddar cheese omelette; he had the (pineapple)muffin, I had the toast, served with freezer jam(!), and the hash browns were delicious as well. </p>
<p>Next on our list was a visit to the aquarium; this is where the "Free Willy" whale was held until public outcry demanded that he be released. It is a terrific and well-laid out exhibit, with a good jellyfish display, as well as otters, sharks, local fish tanks, sea pens, anemones, etc. They had a very good seabird exhibit as well, and we quite enjoyed the puffins. </p>
<p>At 1:15 we headed off to Yaquina Point, to see the tallest lighthouse in the state. Alas, there was a $5 fee and a half hour wait to get into the parking lot, so we drove to nearby Agate Beach, parked the car, walked along a wide sandy beach with sand dunes and gorgeous waves, to take some wonderful shots of the lighthouse from this vantage point. It is always a treat for me to just meander on the beach, so this ended up being just perfect for me. </p>
<p>An hour later we drove to Tillamook, which is home to the cheese factory of the same name. On the self-guided tour, we saw the large tanks of cheese being made, and the huge blocks of it being cut up and packaged for sale. Doug bought two bags of squeaky fresh curds, and we both enjoyed our $1.50-a-scoop ice cream... everyone was eating it, so we really had no choice at all. I chose Oregon strawberry, which Doug decided was better than his peaches and cream. Yum! </p>
<p>Our intention was to go to Cape Meares, to see the smallest lighthouse in Ogegon, and then travel on to see the tallest waterfall. However, we had driven by the cut-off for Cape Meares and decided to forego the waterfall and not be so late getting to Nanaimo tomorrow. So, back we went for fifteen plus miles, and we were so happy we had. We stopped to take photos of huge rocks in the water we had passed by on the wrong side of the road on our way out of town, and just thoroughly enjoyed our search for the lighthouse. </p>
<p>Since it was the smallest lighthouse we had assumed we would have to get to a spot to see it from the highest hill. That assumption was wrong but we did spend fifteen minutes admiring the wonderful views from the beach in that area. A local woman sent us in the right direction, after warning us the road was rough. It was almost all paved, though, except where the there had been a landslide(!), but we loved the scenery along this winding, narrow, and tree-lined road up the side of the mountain. Cape Meares is a beautiful little spot off the main thoroughfare and we were amongst a very small group of people checking it out. The lighthouse is wonderful, as was the walk along the trail of this old growth forest. What a beautiful spot this was, and we couldn't help repeating several times how glad we were that we had come here. We were just leaving when we spotted a a sign for an "octopus tree" and went off to check that out; it was worth the little walk out of our way, as the tree was formed by wind patterns and had eight distinct long "legs" extending upwards around a wide open body at the base. </p>
<p>We laughed at some of the signs we spotted along the road today for tsunamis, rock slides, and land slides as well as elk and deer warning signs along the roads. </p>
<p>So, now having decided not to see the waterfalls this trip, but also having decided we will do that perhaps next year, we headed towards Portland. It was quite a wild ride between the coast and inland, as it was a very well maintained and lonely road, making it very easy, despite the curves, to go a very good pace. However, we also had a monster truck and trailer behind us, often just a little too close behind us(!), and Doug said he felt like we were reliving the movie "Duel" ... not being able to get rid of this guy, even when the size of him should have left him in the dust! </p>
<p>We crossed into the many-bridged city of Portland at 8:30 and an hour later stopped for dinner at "Papa Pete's" in Ridgefield, Washington. We were hungry by this time, having missed lunch, but filled up on fresh fruit brought from home and some chocolate from Susan as well. The pizza was fine and we worked on a crossword puzzle while waiting for it to arrive. </p>
<p>Doug had called earlier to book us a room at the Motel 6 in Centralia, after learning that the one closer one to Oregon was filled. So, a late arrival to our room at 11 P.M. It was just as well that we didn't have an Internet connection here, despite our disappointment, as we were both tired and ready to relax and turn out the light. Bed at midnight...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/07/centralia_washington_to_nanaim.html">Centralia, Washington to Nanaimo, B.C.</a></h2>
								<p>On the road at 9 A.M. after breakfast at a local west coast chain called "Shari's"; it was right next to the motel, so seemed the obvious choice. It was fine, if characterless. I had my usual eggs, toast and hash browns with tea, while Doug added a cinnamon bun to his; we were both astounded at the size of it, but we are in America. We worked on the crossword puzzle from last night while waiting to eat. </p>
<p>Traffic was fairly light for a Friday morning, and we had an express lane for most of the trip through Seattle. We both enjoyed those amazing lush green views and the thick green wooded areas, such a treat after brown San Francisco. </p>
<p>We stopped in Mount Vernon to call Gail and Tom; the phone was busy so we had time to buy six boxes of "ribs" for them before getting through and letting them know we thought we would be in Horseshoe Bay in time for the 3 P.M. ferry. Ah, we had forgotten about the traffic problems that now exist there. </p>
<p>We bought gas in Blaine and then had a fairly short wait at the border, crossing into B.C. at 1 P.M. Our plan was to stop in at Kripp's Pharmacy for our vitamins, and then hotfoot it to Horseshoe Bay, but our plans were thwarted by extremely heavy traffic on Oak Street, worse traffic on Granville Street due to construction work and a broken down taxi, and then serious slowdowns on Georgia Street to get over the Lion's Gate Bridge. However, after realizing that we were not going to make the 3 P.M. ferry, I just sat back and enjoyed the familiar scenery. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom were waiting for us when we pulled up near the terminal at 3:05; it was grand to see them. It had started to rain lightly as we passed the border, and there they were with their rain jackets on, patiently waiting for us. They had arrived in at 2:45. We drove up the highway to get into the ferry line, and Tom and Doug walked back down to Troll's for fish and chips for all but Tom. Gail and I shared a box with double fish, and enjoyed the time (and the fish and chips!) together while waiting for the ferry. We had lots of it too, as we didn't manage to get on the 5 o'clock ferry either but were on the one at 6 P.M.</p>
<p>We arrived in Nanaimo an hour and forty minutes later, unpacked the car, and Gail and I sat playing our first games of cards with a big pot of tea. It's lovely to be here!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/07/nanaimo_explorations_and_famil.html">Nanaimo Explorations and Family Trees</a></h2>
								<p>Ah, this is the life! Gail had the cards all set up when I emerged this morning and we had three games before getting on with the rest of our day. Egg, tea, and their delicious homemade seedy bread for breakfast... yum! </p>
<p>We all drove downtown to the book sale at the library; what a bargain... a big grocery bag full of hard and soft cover books for $4.75! I found four for Gail as well, which I can read when I'm here in the future... maybe once our eyes have gone blurry on us and we only have time for for cards with really big numbers on them! </p>
<p>From there we walked to the local museum; Gail and Tom are members but for $3.00 each we all went in to take part in their new fifties exhibit, which included a sundae or ice cream float. The curator was so friendly and let us have one of each; it has been years since any of us had a float, and Gail and I enjoyed our root beer with ice cream in a glass. We started off, though, by cooperating in a game of "name that 50s tune and singer"... sixteen in all. Collectively we got all but one set, and even though we had a couple of the artists wrong, each couple won a newly published book on the history of Nanaimo. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug drove home while Gail and I went to the casino. I had a birthday gift from there... ten dollars to play in return for five dollars, and had two of them, so of course I couldn't let that go to waste. There are now two-cent machines, so Gail and I managed to find two side-by-side seats and played all nine lines. It was great fun, as we played for over an hour, winning enough to keep us going. Gail finished up with her alloted play amount for today and then waited patiently while I played through to just eighty cents over from where I had started. I know, I know... we're hardly big time gamblers but we sure do have fun. </p>
<p>Back at home, Gail and I got started at the family archives work we have been looking forward to doing together, and finally Gail broke off to make us a lovely dinner of grilled wild salmon, brown rice, peas and corn, and a big platter full of raw veggies. Hot tea and cards followed for us, and then it was back to the computer. </p>
<p>This time 'round we not only did some research but also printed up copies of birth and death certificates for everyone we could find. We had to pull ourselves away just after 11 P.M. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug had been reading all evening and Doug went through the photos of our trip, deleting the blurry ones I took from inside a moving car! Tomorrow I will go through them with him, but it was bedtime when we turned off the computer. It was a wonderful day out on the town, and in front of the computer! Lights out at 12:15.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/07/protection_island_and_dinghy_d.html">Protection Island and Dinghy Dock</a></h2>
								<p>Tom and Doug went off at 10:30 this morning for the opening of the new Nanaimo skating rink, leaving Gail and I to our usual devices: cards, breakfast (egg, delicious toast, and tea), followed by cards, and then some time on the computer on our family research. It's hard to pull ourselves away once we get started but today we were off for a walk around Protection Island. We parked the car downtown and were at the dock in lots of time for the ten-minute ferry trip at 1:10. </p>
<p>We ambled along the pathway, admiring the homes and fenced-in gardens, and Gail pointed out three huge heron nests to me, which they had seen on their last trip here a couple of weeks ago. One was sitting on another tree branch, so that was a treat; we took a few photos and meandered back for lunch at the Dingy Dock, a restaurant right on the wharf that we always enjoy. I guess we were all hungry, and waiting an hour for our lunch was not as much fun as it could have been if we weren't eating so late... 2:30 seating and no food for another hour. However, the view was lovely, and we survived, and Gail and I thoroughly enjoyed the free tea we got served after the waitress said she would have the ferry do a trip on the half hour so we didn't need to dash right out after eating. </p>
<p>Home, computer for Gail and me... Doug and Tom out on the deck reading, as usual, and a break for dinner of homemade lasagna, a big plate of raw veggies, and fruit for dessert. Back to the computer, filling in a few more spots on Gail's Ancestry.com site. </p>
<p>Bed after a couple of card games... reading... night night.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/07/pennys_palapa_and_1744.html">"Penny's Palapa" and 1744!</a></h2>
								<p>We spent a quiet morning here at home, getting papers organized to take to the Mormon Church, where Gail and I had hoped to do a few hours of family research. Of course, there was time for cards, and emails, and we did some scanning of family papers as well, so that I have copies of pertinent information now online on Gail's Internet site. </p>
<p>But before going off for our four hours at the church, brunch at "Penny's Palapa" was on our must-do list. We took two cars and parked in the local mall, so we could go our separate ways after eating. We were the first in line when the doors opened, and so chose the perfect table for us, two seats in the sun for Gail and me, and two in the shade for our men. What a meal we had! I moaned often enough that Doug commented that I must be enjoying my meal and was I ever... a full plate of delicious refried black beans, guacamole, rice with tomatoes, a big salad, jicama, perfectly grilled bell peppers and onions, and topped off with two slices of wonderful grilled tofu. Doug and I rarely eat Mexican food away from San Francisco, but never miss eating at Penny's! Doug and Gail had huevos rancheros, their favourite, and Tom had a breakfast burrito. Yum! </p>
<p>It was another perfect day here, bright blue skies, sunny, and with a nice breeze blowing. Gail and I set off for the church while Tom and Doug went on a book store tour. However, we were very disappointed to find the church doors locked, with a sign saying they were only open now for three hours each Tuesday over the summer. We will be on a train during those hours tomorrow, so we missed this opportunity on the Mormon Web sites. </p>
<p>Back home we went, and got right to work on Gail's computer. We started searching for Jacob Parcels, and it took over an hour to sift through the 12,000 Parcels online! I sorted through my myriad copies of Parcels, Stolls, and Rogers/Rodgers and hope one day we will have a fat file on the Lee side as well. The scanner broke down on us and wouldn't give us a straight copy, but eventually Doug got that working again. </p>
<p>Gail stopped at 5 o'clock to get our dinner on the table... lasagna and a big veggie plate, before heading out to Costco. Gail and Tom stocked up on more fruits and veggies for us, and a stop at a grocery store finished up our list for luncheon on Wednesday with Jody and Judi. </p>
<p>And now comes the exciting part of our day. While clearing and sorting through the huge stack of my paperwork, we came across the email from Rick Parcels, from three years ago, about the second generation of Parcels who had moved to Canada from New Jersey. Gail entered in the last name we had, William Henry, and then typed in the name of Richard, given to us in this long-ago email from Rick. Up popped only five Richard Parcels; we knew his wife's name was Marie Garnier from the first hit, and there he was! Even his father's name was listed: John, who was from New Jersey, born in 1744. We were very excited about this latest find; it takes hours and hours of research to ensure that you have the "right" name, and finally this one paid off! It's really hard to settle down to sleep after something like this happens, but it had been a long busy day and reading for a bit settled both Gail and me down for the night at 11:30. </p>
<p>Just a recap here... Margaret Ethel Parcels born in 1900. William Amos Parcel, her father, born in 1857. His father was William Henry born in 1825, and his father, Richard, was born in 1790. The last generation we have is John, Gram's great-great-grandfather, John Parcells, born in Hackenssack, Bergen, New Jersey. He is my great-great-great grandfather and then add an extra "great" to that for Kelly and Bryn, and yet another for Bryn, Caillie, Riku, and Mirei! Wow!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/07/nanaimo_to_courtney_round_trip.html">Nanaimo to Courtney (Round Trip), and 1744!!!!</a></h2>
								<p>Today was the day for our train trip to Courtney. Gail and Tom had booked tickets for us a couple of weeks ago, and we all got quite a chuckle out of the ticket prices. Doug and I paid senior rates, and Gail and Tom travelled free as our escorts! We split the cost evenly and were all happy, even we old folks. </p>
<p>The train left at 10:40 but we were down at the old station at 10 o'clock, just in case there was a crowd. There was, but not outside; we had a tour group already seated on the train, filling it up, but people were most cooperative, putting children on laps, and we all had a seat for the trip to Qualicum Beach, where most people got off. </p>
<p>This was a wonderfully relaxing trip, through thick forests and running alongside a main road heading north to Courtney. Gail had packed up a delicious picnic lunch of lentil loaf sandwiches for the men, and tuna for us, along with a bag of veggies and fresh strawberries for all as well. Gail and I bought a big cup of hot tea at the end of the line, a two-hour trip up. We spent only thirty-five minutes at the station in Courtney, and then headed back to Nanaimo, spreading out so that both Gail and Tom had window seats, while Doug and I shared a double. </p>
<p>We dashed off to buy a few groceries for lunch tomorrow, and then were home for dinner... grilled wild salmon, spinach, sweet potatoes, and fruit for dessert. The meals in this B&B are just wonderful! </p>
<p>Tea and cards followed dinner, and then Gail and I got back to our usual spots in the computer room, and tonight was such a rush! We decided to work on Gram's people again tonight, and managed to get back to 1744!!!!! on the Parcel's side. We were just astounded, but it all fits... all the names are in the right places, all the dates fit, we have marriage and/or birth and/or death certificates so that we know we are correct. Tom and Doug heard us whooping and hollering in the living room. How can we possibly just stop and go to sleep after this? I sent a quick email to the "girls", letting them know we had some great news and were just waiting to hear from them... a little teasing to get them to write. Cards before going to bed helped us both sleep... </p>
<p>p.s. Just heard from Bryn... "Now off to put Riku to bed.  He just had his first day at school and it went swimmingly! "</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/07/luncheon_with_the_ladies_and_1.html">Luncheon with the "Ladies", and 1592!!!!</a></h2>
								<p>Gail and I started the day off with our usual game or two of cards and a big bowl of fruit, before getting busy preparing for our luncheon guests, Judi and Jody. I had some laundry to do first and got that out of the way, poured a little Grand Marnier over the dessert, Gail washed the spinach, made up a small plate of strawberries and fresh pineapple, and before we knew it Judi was arriving on the ferry at 10:15 A.M.</p>
<p>Judi looks great, and brought along gifts... a big wheel of Brie, which Gail sliced and put on the fruit plate, a birthday gift for me, and a box of my favourite #16 tea from Harrod's. We sat and visited on the deck until Jody arrived at 11:30, and then made tea and nibbled a bit for an hour. </p>
<p>Lunch was delicious: the mushroom soup was perfect, the fresh tomato bread very tasty, the salad with strawberries fresh and yummy, and then the oh-so-good pots de creme for dessert with tea later on. This was Judy's first visit to Gail and Tom's home, and she was delighted to be here with us; Jody curled up and made herself at home, and even though she had told us she couldn't stay on much later than Judi's 2:40 departure, stayed and chatted until 4:45. It was lovely to have the time to really catch up on all her B&B news, and to fill them in on the family news on our end too. Jody brought Gail a lovely hibiscus which is now the centrepiece in the living room. </p>
<p>I had a drive out to one of the local malls with Jody in her silver Miata convertible, and met Gail, Tom, and Doug there to run a few errands. We went on to a second mall to do a little personal shopping for two hours, while the guys, who had spent a few hours this afternoon together, put in more time waiting for us. Home for dinner... leftovers, but very tasty ones... mushroom soup for Gail and me, lasagna and tomato bread for Doug and Tom, and veggies for all.  </p>
<p>Gail and I were very busy on the computer both before and after dinner, and stuck with it too late until we had found the "lost generation" that was driving us crazy from our hard work on Monday. We did it! All the way back to... are you ready?????.... 1592!!!!! Now, this is not a direct line, as we had hoped to be able to do, but we got stuck on Gram's male line back in 1744, and so decided to continue on with the female side. This takes us to France... Normandy and Grenoble, among other places. We never ever had an inkling of having any French connections but have proudly added it to the English, Irish, Scots, and Germans that make us Rodgers children. </p>
<p>Bed too late.... 12:45, as after our hard work and concentration we had to play two games of cards to settle us down. I still had a difficult time sleeping...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/07/campbell_river_and_a_sea_wall.html">Campbell River and a Sea Wall Walk</a></h2>
								<p>Our late night last night changed my plans to leave at 8 A.M. today for our visit with Juan and Judy. Gail and I took the time for a game of cards and a wonderful fruit bowl, and Doug and I finally left at 9:30. Ah well, we are on vacation and it's wonderful not to have to stick too closely to an agenda. </p>
<p>It was a gorgeous drive up to their isolated spot at Brown's Bay, ten miles north of Campbell River; we stopped to buy some B.C. cherries for them, and continued on to their three-mile gravel road, at the end of which we found Judy, Christine, her husband Steve, and sons Steve and Zacchary outside chatting with a neighbour. It was lovely to see Christine again, as the last time we saw her was on her wedding day eleven years ago. Juan was inside the house and soon we were all gathered on the deck, chatting and catching up. Judy had prepared a wonderful luncheon of pasta with pesto, a great salad, and garlic bread. There was garlic shrimp too, but it was too large and in the casing still... not my thing at all. </p>
<p>The boys were friendly and open and stayed with us for most of the afternoon, and I of course got busy with the camera and had lots of photos taken, one of Judy, Juan, Doug, and me together for perhaps the first time ever. Nice to have an extra body there for this reason alone! </p>
<p>It was a very hot drive coming home, and I dozed off a bit after we passed some spectacular snow-covered mountains. We arrived home before 5:30, Gail and I had a cup of tea, and Doug caught up on his emails before we headed out in the car to park near the sea wall. Our destination was fish 'n chips at "Trollers's", and it was every bit as good as Gail had promised it would be. She and I shared a double order, a perfect size for us. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom had been busy during our time away, stocking up on more fruit at Costco's, and doing some household things that had been neglected during out stay. </p>
<p>Hot, hot, hot here today... 25C; the house soon cooled off though with the ceiling fans going full tilt.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/07/hot_hot_hot_1.html">Hot, Hot, Hot!!!!!</a></h2>
								<p>Oh my gosh; British Columbia is not supposed to be this hot! We had a 35C day today, and the temperature in the house when we walked in tonight was 92F. It is now down to a balmy 89F, after having had the windows open and the ceiling fans whiring for over three hours. We leave here on Sunday morning and have been promised even hotter weather in Norther California... quite possibly 113F! </p>
<p>Despite the heat, we had a wonderful day here on Vancouver Island. I awoke very early, having had trouble staying asleep in early morning heat, and had time for a few emails before Gail awoke at 7:10. </p>
<p>We had a very leisurely morning, as usual. Candy called, and I was lucky enough to answer the phone and have a long chat with her before handing it over to Gail. She and Rick are on the way to their trailer tonight, where she won't be allowed to do a thing, thanks to the cortisone shots she had yesterday in her back. </p>
<p>We left the house for the outdoor market on the waterfront, with Doug hoping to buy some fresh curds. They were overpriced, but he did buy a half dozen raisin scones and two jars of homemade jam (rhubarb and Bing cherry). </p>
<p>Gail had packed us another wonderful picnic lunch of fresh salmon sandwiches for all but Doug, who chose once again to have his favourite lentil loaf sandwich. Gail is keeping him well supplied and happy! We also packed up containers of fresh fruit... strawberries, Bing cherries, and crisp red grapes, a nice chunk of the Brie Judi brought over for us, cold Cokes, and two big water bottles for each of us. </p>
<p>Tom found the perfect picnic spot for us, a camping site with a table in the shade, at Englishman River Falls. We all enjoyed our lunch and then went off to see the fast moving falls just a few minutes drive from our site. Doug took lots of photos of the falls and Gail and I took lots of each other. </p>
<p>Yesterday, Gail had called Don Thompson, the local folk artist Susan and Bryn discovered many years ago; he made the nine foot wooden Mountie who lives in our dining room. A visit to his outdoor "gallery" was next on our agenda, and we arrived just a few minutes after Jody and Hal, with whom I had made arrangements last night. What a character he is! Susan, her mom, and Amelia had visited him in May, and I was so impressed and delighted with all the whimsical animals in his yard that I was determined to visit as well. He and his wife, Ann, could not have been more welcoming. They made us feel right at home, with Don giving us the grand tour of the property, each area containing many samples of his work, as well as the "sheds" which were packed full as well. He looks like a West Coast Santa, with a quirky, pun-laden sense of humour, and a twinkle in his eye. We all enjoyed our time there so much and promised to return. He and I also agreed to exchange photos of the Mountie; he has one of it for us and I shall send him one taken in the Mountie's new home. I took dozens and dozens of photos and must send him a couple of them. </p>
<p>A stop at the Coombs market, famous in the area for the goats on the roof, where we picked up some fresh corn on the cob (Gail and I had a hankering for it today), and Doug found new "instant" Indian curries to take home. </p>
<p>Jody and Hal's gorgeous B&B is not too far away, and we had been promised tea and dessert in exchange for a little computer help from Doug. Hal had moved the table out under the trees at the back of the yard, and they had a huge tray Hal had built, filled with tall glasses, a choice of beverages with lots of ice, and a really wonderful blackberry bread pudding with whipped cream atop. Jody has known Doug long enough that she knew this would be a huge hit and it was, with all of us. Their gardens, flower and vegetable, are well ordered and gorgeous, as is the house. What a lovely home they have created for themselves, and all their lucky guests too. You can see it  <a href="http://heritagecottage.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>We had several stops to make on the way home... one to the gallery where Mr. Thompson's art is sold, but alas, it was closed, much too early on a Friday night we felt!... and then into Nanaimo to stock up on Devon custard for SF (Amelia and Riku are particularly fond of it), and get some sand toys to pick up for Riku's beach trips in two weeks; Doug managed to find a few more books on sale while waiting for us. </p>
<p>None of us was particularly hungry after our very generous portions of pudding, and of course the heat didn't have us wishing for anything heavy either, so two cobs of corn, followed by lots of fresh fruit and a little more cheese, was dinner tonight. We sat outside on the deck, waiting for the house to cool down to 89F! Gail and I played cards under the dining room fan, while Doug and Tom chose to read downstairs where it is much cooler. </p>
<p>I'm off to bed at 11:30; the temperature in the dining room is still sitting at 89F!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/07/oh_my_gosh.html">Oh My Gosh!</a></h2>
								<p>The house cooled down last night to 83F! We all slept quite well, as there was a breeze blowing in after midnight, although Gail had trouble falling asleep and so slept in until 8:15 today. I was up on the computer at 7 o'clock and showering when Gail awoke. She went off with Tom to Weight Watchers for a weigh-in, coming home pleased with her half pound gain, despite the Brie cheese, pots de creme, and generous portion of Jody's bread pudding. I'm only up a pound since I left home, so I am pleased as well. We've been eating very well, but with lots of fruit and veg' too, which obviously helps. </p>
<p>We had Judi Speirs' "omelettes in a bag" for breakfast, a great idea if a large number of people need to be fed. We tried it out to test it for Candy and Rick's family reunion and it's going to be a hit. Basically, you beat two eggs in a bowl, add whatever extra ingredients you choose... we had spinach, cheese, shallots, and fresh tomato, add a dab of butter, some pepper and salt, and pour into a one quart Zip-Lock bag. Take the air out, seal it, and drop into a pot of boiling water for twelve minutes for a less generously filled omelette and another five minutes or so for the bigger ones. They were as delicious as Judi's friend claimed they were in her email, fluffy and light and perfect for those large gatherings. They could be done outside on the barbecue on hot mornings. Tea, Gail's and Tom's wonderful seedy toast, and cards followed. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug went out to pick up the gold chain I had taken in for repair work, and Gail and I went outside on the shady front deck for pedicures. It was just lovely out there... much cooler than in the house, so our soak in hot water was just fine. We scrubbed and pumiced, creamed and removed nail polish, polished, and ended it all with a hand wax and foot wax too, leaving us with very soft and refreshed feet. What a treat! </p>
<p>Comet, the neighbour's dog, joined us too; Gail and Tom are her best friends when her owners are out, and sometimes when they are not! </p>
<p>When I awoke the house was at 82F. An hour later we were up to 83F, and now at 6:15 it is 93 degrees! Man, oh man! We have spent most of the day downstairs in the much cooler recreation room, with all of us moaning and groaning each time we came upstairs. </p>
<p>Doug and Tom had lentil loaf sandwiches for lunch; Gail and I had large plates of fresh fruit, all we needed after our big breakfast. Cherries, strawberries, red grapes, and fresh pineapple were the perfect meal for this hot day. </p>
<p>Gail and I had our afternoon tea downstairs while we played cards, Tom and Doug took refuge while reading, and Doug found the energy to pack up the trunk of the car for tomorrow's trip home. I sorted out a large bag of paper I had brought with me, thinking I would have so much spare time! What a dreamer I am; we were far too busy with the family tree, various outings, and cards when we needed a break. I will be returning home with most of the magazines I brought along to pass on to Gail. Ah well, such is the life of a too-much-to-do-in-too-short-a-time person. </p>
<p>We had dinner downstairs too.. veggie burgers and bean salad for the boys, and the last of the cream of mushroom soup and tomato bread for Gail and me. Just before dinner Gail had whipped the two of us up a delicious fruity and refreshing beverage of watermelon, pineapple, and club soda. Too bad we just discovered these, as we could have been drinking them all week long. Ah well, I will be back here in less than two weeks with Riku. </p>
<p>Off at 7 P.M. to take part in some of the Nanaimo Bathtub Race Weekend, an annnual event for over forty years. We plan to stake out a bench, under a big shady tree, take our books along, and enjoy the cool breeze off the water until the fireworks at 10 P.M. Gail and I will head over to the casino for an hour or so, as I must use up my voucher from my win last week.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/07/a_day_with_amelia.html">A Day with Amelia</a></h2>
								<p>This was a perfectly wonderful day, as I had a Amelia with me for a full day, from before 8:30 'til after 5:30. This is a rare treat, since I usually have her after nursery school for half days. She had her head buried in her daddy's shoulder when he rang the bell, but within a minute or two, she was happily climbing the stairs with me to wave goodbye to him and find her "baby". We also noticed that Sutro Tower had disappeared in a blanket of fog, although it's sunny on this part of the city.</p>
<p>We had a little snuggle on a chair in the living room, and talked about our upcoming plane trips; she told me she is going to wear her PJs on the plane to Alaska. Not quite ready to eat, Amelia got busy in the "kitchen", making a big tower of the plastic tea cups, and getting Doug over to admire it as well. I found a basket for her two babies, put a blanket in to make it soft and cover them with, and Amelia happily walked around the house chatting to her babies and fussing with them. She's such a good mommy! </p>
<p>We all had breakfast together; she had had a snack before coming over and had insisted she wasn't hungry when she first arrived. However, she ate some toast, cherries (a few helpings of these; she likes them as much as we do), and lots of juice. Before going off to the playground on 20th Street, she had Doug read a little "Dick and Jane" story to her. Of course she had him engaged as he sat at the computer too, showing her the spider she likes so much and chatting with him.</p>
<p>I brought both Amelia and Riku gardening gloves back from BC, and Amelia spent a little time in the garden trying hers out, lifting heavy rocks and putting them in the wheelbarrow.  </p>
<p>Off to the playground for an hour and a half; Amelia met a new friend called Samantha. She and Amelia just hit it off, and played ever so nicely together for the full time there. They ran around, climbed on the playground equipment, sat in the sandbox briefly, and ended off their time by taking turns pushing each other around on a tricycle with a long handle attached. Amelia is <strong>strong</strong> and even when Sam' wasn't peddling, she struggled to keep her moving! She's an amazing little girl, is our Amelia! </p>
<p>She cried a little bit when we had to leave, but it was obvious she was a tired girl. I assured her we would have lunch and a story first, and of course she was just fine. We all had lunch together, and Amelia ate all of the mac' and cheese with broccoli that her mom had sent over, plus more fruit and juice. Tuck-in was a breeze... one story and Amelia was asleep before I could finish off all the verses to "The Wheels on the Bus". It was very sweet as she asked if I would sleep with her; the last time she asked she told me that I "<em>didn't</em> sleep with children", and seemed to accept this easily again today. I told her I had work to do, and that was the end of that. Her little body relaxed and gave in and she napped for just over an hour and a half, waking happily and calling out she was awake now. </p>
<p>This afternoon, after her snack, we washed our hands and got busy making banana bread together. What a treat this was, as she was very serious about the whole project, mashing the bananas with vigour, beating in the eggs, carefully pouring in the oil, adding the flour and baking soda, tipping in the milk and vanilla, and stirring away happily, holding on to the edge of the bowl. She helped spoon the batter into the pan, and then happily used the spatula to polish off the bits of batter left there for her. </p>
<p>Rather than go out again, we spent the rest of our day at home, reading every lift-the-flap book we could find... we have lots!, and while I did some tidying up in the kitchen, Amelia sat working on puzzles. I joined her for the ABC puzzle and she happily recited to me all the words that being with a particular letter; she and her mom have been doing this at home and it was fun to hear her double letters and learning new ones too. Usually we spend some time upstairs, but today Amelia was happy to wander about playing with one thing after another. </p>
<p>Susan came by bearing many gifts... two bouquets of beautiful flowers!... whites and creams, deep purples, and purple thistle, which really set them all off. I love them. And of course there was food... organic strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries, along with two tubs of wonderful puddings... one a dark Belgium chocolate pudding, and two imported chocolate bars. </p>
<p>After waving goodbye, I quickly made a "chicken" burger up for Doug with all the trimmings, and cut my burger up into a big bowl of mixed greens. After dinner, we went up to watch a movie, but I found it boring, gave up half way through it, and came downstairs to answer some e-mails and annotate the photos of Amelia from today. They were just too cute to delay showing her mom and dad, and my sisters and Uncle Frank too! Amelia is such a sunny and happy little girl, and such a dear companion. </p>
<p>bed at 12:45... too late!</p>
