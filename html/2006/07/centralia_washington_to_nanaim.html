								<h2>Centralia, Washington to Nanaimo, B.C.</h2>
								<p>On the road at 9 A.M. after breakfast at a local west coast chain called "Shari's"; it was right next to the motel, so seemed the obvious choice. It was fine, if characterless. I had my usual eggs, toast and hash browns with tea, while Doug added a cinnamon bun to his; we were both astounded at the size of it, but we are in America. We worked on the crossword puzzle from last night while waiting to eat. </p>
<p>Traffic was fairly light for a Friday morning, and we had an express lane for most of the trip through Seattle. We both enjoyed those amazing lush green views and the thick green wooded areas, such a treat after brown San Francisco. </p>
<p>We stopped in Mount Vernon to call Gail and Tom; the phone was busy so we had time to buy six boxes of "ribs" for them before getting through and letting them know we thought we would be in Horseshoe Bay in time for the 3 P.M. ferry. Ah, we had forgotten about the traffic problems that now exist there. </p>
<p>We bought gas in Blaine and then had a fairly short wait at the border, crossing into B.C. at 1 P.M. Our plan was to stop in at Kripp's Pharmacy for our vitamins, and then hotfoot it to Horseshoe Bay, but our plans were thwarted by extremely heavy traffic on Oak Street, worse traffic on Granville Street due to construction work and a broken down taxi, and then serious slowdowns on Georgia Street to get over the Lion's Gate Bridge. However, after realizing that we were not going to make the 3 P.M. ferry, I just sat back and enjoyed the familiar scenery. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom were waiting for us when we pulled up near the terminal at 3:05; it was grand to see them. It had started to rain lightly as we passed the border, and there they were with their rain jackets on, patiently waiting for us. They had arrived in at 2:45. We drove up the highway to get into the ferry line, and Tom and Doug walked back down to Troll's for fish and chips for all but Tom. Gail and I shared a box with double fish, and enjoyed the time (and the fish and chips!) together while waiting for the ferry. We had lots of it too, as we didn't manage to get on the 5 o'clock ferry either but were on the one at 6 P.M.</p>
<p>We arrived in Nanaimo an hour and forty minutes later, unpacked the car, and Gail and I sat playing our first games of cards with a big pot of tea. It's lovely to be here!</p>
