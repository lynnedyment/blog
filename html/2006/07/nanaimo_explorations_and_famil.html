								<h2>Nanaimo Explorations and Family Trees</h2>
								<p>Ah, this is the life! Gail had the cards all set up when I emerged this morning and we had three games before getting on with the rest of our day. Egg, tea, and their delicious homemade seedy bread for breakfast... yum! </p>
<p>We all drove downtown to the book sale at the library; what a bargain... a big grocery bag full of hard and soft cover books for $4.75! I found four for Gail as well, which I can read when I'm here in the future... maybe once our eyes have gone blurry on us and we only have time for for cards with really big numbers on them! </p>
<p>From there we walked to the local museum; Gail and Tom are members but for $3.00 each we all went in to take part in their new fifties exhibit, which included a sundae or ice cream float. The curator was so friendly and let us have one of each; it has been years since any of us had a float, and Gail and I enjoyed our root beer with ice cream in a glass. We started off, though, by cooperating in a game of "name that 50s tune and singer"... sixteen in all. Collectively we got all but one set, and even though we had a couple of the artists wrong, each couple won a newly published book on the history of Nanaimo. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug drove home while Gail and I went to the casino. I had a birthday gift from there... ten dollars to play in return for five dollars, and had two of them, so of course I couldn't let that go to waste. There are now two-cent machines, so Gail and I managed to find two side-by-side seats and played all nine lines. It was great fun, as we played for over an hour, winning enough to keep us going. Gail finished up with her alloted play amount for today and then waited patiently while I played through to just eighty cents over from where I had started. I know, I know... we're hardly big time gamblers but we sure do have fun. </p>
<p>Back at home, Gail and I got started at the family archives work we have been looking forward to doing together, and finally Gail broke off to make us a lovely dinner of grilled wild salmon, brown rice, peas and corn, and a big platter full of raw veggies. Hot tea and cards followed for us, and then it was back to the computer. </p>
<p>This time 'round we not only did some research but also printed up copies of birth and death certificates for everyone we could find. We had to pull ourselves away just after 11 P.M. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug had been reading all evening and Doug went through the photos of our trip, deleting the blurry ones I took from inside a moving car! Tomorrow I will go through them with him, but it was bedtime when we turned off the computer. It was a wonderful day out on the town, and in front of the computer! Lights out at 12:15.</p>
