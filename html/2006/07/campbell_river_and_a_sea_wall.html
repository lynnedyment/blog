								<h2>Campbell River and a Sea Wall Walk</h2>
								<p>Our late night last night changed my plans to leave at 8 A.M. today for our visit with Juan and Judy. Gail and I took the time for a game of cards and a wonderful fruit bowl, and Doug and I finally left at 9:30. Ah well, we are on vacation and it's wonderful not to have to stick too closely to an agenda. </p>
<p>It was a gorgeous drive up to their isolated spot at Brown's Bay, ten miles north of Campbell River; we stopped to buy some B.C. cherries for them, and continued on to their three-mile gravel road, at the end of which we found Judy, Christine, her husband Steve, and sons Steve and Zacchary outside chatting with a neighbour. It was lovely to see Christine again, as the last time we saw her was on her wedding day eleven years ago. Juan was inside the house and soon we were all gathered on the deck, chatting and catching up. Judy had prepared a wonderful luncheon of pasta with pesto, a great salad, and garlic bread. There was garlic shrimp too, but it was too large and in the casing still... not my thing at all. </p>
<p>The boys were friendly and open and stayed with us for most of the afternoon, and I of course got busy with the camera and had lots of photos taken, one of Judy, Juan, Doug, and me together for perhaps the first time ever. Nice to have an extra body there for this reason alone! </p>
<p>It was a very hot drive coming home, and I dozed off a bit after we passed some spectacular snow-covered mountains. We arrived home before 5:30, Gail and I had a cup of tea, and Doug caught up on his emails before we headed out in the car to park near the sea wall. Our destination was fish 'n chips at "Trollers's", and it was every bit as good as Gail had promised it would be. She and I shared a double order, a perfect size for us. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom had been busy during our time away, stocking up on more fruit at Costco's, and doing some household things that had been neglected during out stay. </p>
<p>Hot, hot, hot here today... 25C; the house soon cooled off though with the ceiling fans going full tilt.</p>
