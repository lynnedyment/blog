								<h2>Nanaimo to Courtney (Round Trip), and 1744!!!!</h2>
								<p>Today was the day for our train trip to Courtney. Gail and Tom had booked tickets for us a couple of weeks ago, and we all got quite a chuckle out of the ticket prices. Doug and I paid senior rates, and Gail and Tom travelled free as our escorts! We split the cost evenly and were all happy, even we old folks. </p>
<p>The train left at 10:40 but we were down at the old station at 10 o'clock, just in case there was a crowd. There was, but not outside; we had a tour group already seated on the train, filling it up, but people were most cooperative, putting children on laps, and we all had a seat for the trip to Qualicum Beach, where most people got off. </p>
<p>This was a wonderfully relaxing trip, through thick forests and running alongside a main road heading north to Courtney. Gail had packed up a delicious picnic lunch of lentil loaf sandwiches for the men, and tuna for us, along with a bag of veggies and fresh strawberries for all as well. Gail and I bought a big cup of hot tea at the end of the line, a two-hour trip up. We spent only thirty-five minutes at the station in Courtney, and then headed back to Nanaimo, spreading out so that both Gail and Tom had window seats, while Doug and I shared a double. </p>
<p>We dashed off to buy a few groceries for lunch tomorrow, and then were home for dinner... grilled wild salmon, spinach, sweet potatoes, and fruit for dessert. The meals in this B&B are just wonderful! </p>
<p>Tea and cards followed dinner, and then Gail and I got back to our usual spots in the computer room, and tonight was such a rush! We decided to work on Gram's people again tonight, and managed to get back to 1744!!!!! on the Parcel's side. We were just astounded, but it all fits... all the names are in the right places, all the dates fit, we have marriage and/or birth and/or death certificates so that we know we are correct. Tom and Doug heard us whooping and hollering in the living room. How can we possibly just stop and go to sleep after this? I sent a quick email to the "girls", letting them know we had some great news and were just waiting to hear from them... a little teasing to get them to write. Cards before going to bed helped us both sleep... </p>
<p>p.s. Just heard from Bryn... "Now off to put Riku to bed.  He just had his first day at school and it went swimmingly! "</p>
