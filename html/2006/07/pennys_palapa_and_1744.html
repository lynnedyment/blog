								<h2>"Penny's Palapa" and 1744!</h2>
								<p>We spent a quiet morning here at home, getting papers organized to take to the Mormon Church, where Gail and I had hoped to do a few hours of family research. Of course, there was time for cards, and emails, and we did some scanning of family papers as well, so that I have copies of pertinent information now online on Gail's Internet site. </p>
<p>But before going off for our four hours at the church, brunch at "Penny's Palapa" was on our must-do list. We took two cars and parked in the local mall, so we could go our separate ways after eating. We were the first in line when the doors opened, and so chose the perfect table for us, two seats in the sun for Gail and me, and two in the shade for our men. What a meal we had! I moaned often enough that Doug commented that I must be enjoying my meal and was I ever... a full plate of delicious refried black beans, guacamole, rice with tomatoes, a big salad, jicama, perfectly grilled bell peppers and onions, and topped off with two slices of wonderful grilled tofu. Doug and I rarely eat Mexican food away from San Francisco, but never miss eating at Penny's! Doug and Gail had huevos rancheros, their favourite, and Tom had a breakfast burrito. Yum! </p>
<p>It was another perfect day here, bright blue skies, sunny, and with a nice breeze blowing. Gail and I set off for the church while Tom and Doug went on a book store tour. However, we were very disappointed to find the church doors locked, with a sign saying they were only open now for three hours each Tuesday over the summer. We will be on a train during those hours tomorrow, so we missed this opportunity on the Mormon Web sites. </p>
<p>Back home we went, and got right to work on Gail's computer. We started searching for Jacob Parcels, and it took over an hour to sift through the 12,000 Parcels online! I sorted through my myriad copies of Parcels, Stolls, and Rogers/Rodgers and hope one day we will have a fat file on the Lee side as well. The scanner broke down on us and wouldn't give us a straight copy, but eventually Doug got that working again. </p>
<p>Gail stopped at 5 o'clock to get our dinner on the table... lasagna and a big veggie plate, before heading out to Costco. Gail and Tom stocked up on more fruits and veggies for us, and a stop at a grocery store finished up our list for luncheon on Wednesday with Jody and Judi. </p>
<p>And now comes the exciting part of our day. While clearing and sorting through the huge stack of my paperwork, we came across the email from Rick Parcels, from three years ago, about the second generation of Parcels who had moved to Canada from New Jersey. Gail entered in the last name we had, William Henry, and then typed in the name of Richard, given to us in this long-ago email from Rick. Up popped only five Richard Parcels; we knew his wife's name was Marie Garnier from the first hit, and there he was! Even his father's name was listed: John, who was from New Jersey, born in 1744. We were very excited about this latest find; it takes hours and hours of research to ensure that you have the "right" name, and finally this one paid off! It's really hard to settle down to sleep after something like this happens, but it had been a long busy day and reading for a bit settled both Gail and me down for the night at 11:30. </p>
<p>Just a recap here... Margaret Ethel Parcels born in 1900. William Amos Parcel, her father, born in 1857. His father was William Henry born in 1825, and his father, Richard, was born in 1790. The last generation we have is John, Gram's great-great-grandfather, John Parcells, born in Hackenssack, Bergen, New Jersey. He is my great-great-great grandfather and then add an extra "great" to that for Kelly and Bryn, and yet another for Bryn, Caillie, Riku, and Mirei! Wow!</p>
