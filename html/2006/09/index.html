								<h2><a href="/2006/09/dinner_in_oakville.html">Dinner in Oakville</a></h2>
								<p>I walked Caillie to school this morning, which is always a treat; lovely to have the quiet alone time with her at the beginning of the day. The morning passed quickly; while eating breakfast, Kelly and I watched a fun tape of Oprah, who was on a road trip with her friend, and then Kelly and I got busy at our separate chores. I started the laundry and cleared out the cupboards above the fridge; it felt like a fall day today so the perfect time to start in on fall cleaning, while Kelly had lots to do in her office downstairs.   </p>
<p>The late afternoon was a blur of activity, with Kelly rushing off at 3:25 to pick up Bryant and Mykayla for an appointment downtown with their dad. I quickly made up a fruit snack tray for Bryn and Caillie, who ended up with Uncle Mark at their Dad's instead, for piano practice until Kelly got back home. Meanwhile, I was dashing off to Union Station, leaving me a mere half hour from leaving the house to my train to Oakville leaving at 4:30! I made it with a whole minute to spare! </p>
<p>Carol met me at the train station with her big smile; it's always a treat to see a dear old friend. We've known each other since we were fifteen; hard to imagine that was 46 years ago! Carol had asked around for a new place for dinner and we ended up at "Big Papa" on the Lakeshore. We sat and talked for two hours over our delicious dinners: we shared a large green salad, Carol had mushroom risotto, and I ate half a tasty pizza caprese. </p>
<p>After tea and coffee, we put our purses in the car and headed out for a walk in the night. We're determined to do this during the day next visit as walking around the beach area of Oakville with the large beautiful old houses is such a treat. It was fun peeking in the lit windows though. We walked for an hour and a half before Carol dropped me off at the train station for my 9:30 trip back to Toronto. We'll see each other at Christmas, I hope. </p>
<p>Kelly and Gregg were ready to go to bed soon after I arrived, which meant I was in bed reading at 11:15. I'm reading a book from Kelly, which she loved, called "The Time Traveller's Wife" and I've had lots of reading time lately with bus trips and two train trips over the past week. How I love this extra time to just relax and get through a nice thick book!</p>
