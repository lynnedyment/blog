								<h2><a href="/2006/06/candy_in_town_and_mirei_cuts_h.html">Candy In Town and Mirei Cuts Her First Tooth!</a></h2>
								<p>The forecast called for rain today, and although it didn't happen, it was muggy and overcast all day today. Uncle Frank is missing his perfect Denver mornings, as well as the dry air and lower temperatures. </p>
<p>We had a late leisurely breakfast this morning, with another poached egg, juice, a dozen grapes, and a half banana each. I read through a couple of days' worth of old papers while Uncle Frank went up to the computer and his phone calls. He had called his neighbour yesterday about getting an appointment for his physiotherapy, and was disappointed to learn that she hadn't been able to do so as yet. She needs copies of his surgical records, so today we ran some errands, first to the bank, and then to the nearby plaza to get the copies he needs for his doctor here and his own records as well.</p>
<p>I wanted some things from the bin store, and UF needs cinnamon for the pumpkin pies he makes when Neal comes home, so in the mid-afternoon we headed out, stopping at the cemetery after the bin store. I pulled up some weeds from around both Auntie Rita's and Mom's & Dad's sites, and from there we drove to Rainbow Gardens to buy some colourful flowers and white stones to tidy them both up after we've had some rain. We drove by our old house on Ash Street; it has been completely renovated and I peeked in as many windows as I could. There is a wooden deck with French doors leading off the kitchen, and it made me feel a little teary to see our old kitchen with a new layout and all new cupboards. The hardwood floors in the living room/dining room area look lovely and there is carpet on the stairs going up to our bedrooms. The selling price is now $149,000, up from the $99,000 being asked before the renovations. Glenn had gone through on an open house last weekend and managed to take lots of photos for us of the interior. UF and I both agreed they should plant some flowers in the front flower bed and tidy up the little around the side and back of the house. Mom kept it tidier than that all the years she lived in it on her own. It's still tough to just drive by... </p>
<p>It started to drizzle lightly on the way home. We need the rain for the gardens, which I am hoping Candy will help me with when she is here. I had dinner on the table very quickly tonight... we both enjoyed the wild salmon in dill sauce, a half each of a baked sweet potato, sauteed spinach, and pine nuts, with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar, carrot sticks, and for dessert with tea, a little later on, I made up two dishes of the stewed rhubarb we picked together last fall, with a small amount of custard. Yum! </p>
<p>Tonight, we settled in the living room for the latter part of the evening, with our port. Uncle Frank has books that he received for Christmas, so he read over some recipes from the slow cooker recipe book Gail and Tom gave him. So many sounded easy and delicious that I had him choose three to try this week... he chose a vegetable side dish, a soup, and a meat dish. More on this as we make them. We also had lots of fun trying hard to work on a New York Times crossword book. Oh my! I think we ended with about fourteen words filled in, with a trip to Doug's online dictionary to confirm the prefix "nux<br />
for "vomica"; I can well imagine one page will do for the entire trip at this rate! </p>
<p>While we were relaxing in the living room the phone rang twice; Donna was calling to see if "the girls" could arrange to get together for a full afternoon and evening visit together. She was suggesting that we go to St. Jacob's, but may have decided on a "spa" day starting with time around the pool at Beth's and ending with a whirlpool bath, ordered-in dinner, and hanging out at Donna's and Shel's in the evening, sans Sheldon. I was expecting to hear from Candy tonight; Glenn was picking her up at 7:30 but the line was busy when she called. </p>
<p>Bryn also called me using the free Skype service available right now.. calling from the computer to a home phone number. It was great to hear from him; Riku talked for a little bit, I could hear Mirei in the background, was thrilled to hear that she has cut her first tooth(!)... I knew this would happen when I was away(!)... and a second not far behind apparently, and the happy news that Akane would not be going to Japan on her own with the two children. It has not been settled whether she will stay on with Mirei after her sister's wedding, but I am looking forward to the full days with Riku and adventures with Amelia if this happens.</p>
<p>We headed off for bed at midnight tonight...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/beths_new_house_and.html">Beth's New House and...</a></h2>
								<p>I was at the computer this morning, when Candy called from Glenn's. She was up bright and early and I quickly dressed and went to pick her up to spend some time here with Uncle Frank and me. She looks terrific and was her bright and happy-as-usual self. We sat chatting in the living room until Uncle Frank woke at 11:15 A.M. I had asked him last night not to set his alarm, but he had, for 8:30, and to his credit had decided to crawl back into bed for a bit. I was so pleased that he did, as we should all sleep as much as we need to. Alarms and being wakened are two of my pet peeves.  </p>
<p>Candy made herself a tomato sandwich, and then had tea with Uncle Frank and me over a late breakfast for us... very late, as it was 1:15 when we finished! Uncle Frank had scrambled egg, one slice of turkey bacon, and a slice of toast; he asked for the one slice of bacon but thinks it may have been the only time in his life he had just one. Oh yes, Virginia has been a good teacher for both of us. </p>
<p>We all drove over to Beth's around 3 P.M. The house is just gorgeous, inside and out, with big airy rooms, fourteen acres of fruit trees, lawns and woods, a large in-ground pool, and a just-planted vegetable garden. We walked around some of the property and sat outside for a while, but the mosquitos drove us into the house. It was humid and threatening to rain and they were out in full force. </p>
<p>About 5 P.M. we headed back to Uncle Frank's house; we had a little time here before driving the few miles to Glenn's and Wendy's for dinner. Becky was there as well, looking wonderfully healthy. She told us she had hit the 100 pound weight loss mark; she's doing it on her own and has obviously worked hard at it. </p>
<p>For dinner there was prime rib, with grilled salmon for Wendy and me, mashed potatoes, a big green salad, brussel sprouts, a delicious sauteed spinach and mushroom dish, whole wheat dinner rolls, with Key lime pie or Mississippi mud pie for dessert. It was a great spread and we all sat drinking tea and catching up on our news after dinner. </p>
<p>It was Stephanie's graduation formal tonight; we were sorry not to have seen her in her dress, but look forward to seeing the photos. I snapped some pictures of everyone, although Becky wouldn't let me take one of her; later on she and Glenn dumped water on each other and Beth managed to snap a couple. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank was tired and dozing off a bit so we left to come home about 9:30. We sat and had our port in the kitchen tonight, most unusual for us, but intended getting to bed a little earlier. I checked my email, and found I had a message from Amelia! She wrote me lots of numbers, letters and capital letters... very interesting. I wrote back right away and hope this is the beginning of a lifelong correspondence.  </p>
<p>Uncle Frank finally had his cogeco account working and I left him writing some emails at 11:15. I headed for bed and my book, thinking I would spend a little more time on the computer after Uncle Frank finished off, but turned off my light at midnight instead. I heard UF heading for bed minutes later too...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/a_quiet_saturday_and_an_evenin.html">A Quiet Saturday and an Evening Drive</a></h2>
								<p>I woke at 9 A.M. to find Uncle Frank already up and showered! I showered quickly so we could have an earlier than usual breakfast; today it was cereal, fruit, juice, tea, and whole wheat Italian toast, which we both like a lot. We sat chatting at the table until 11 o'clock; it was overcast and I suggested a short slow walk around the block. However, Uncle Frank felt suddenly tired and went upstairs "just to put my head down" and fell into a deep two-plus-hour sleep.</p>
<p>I tidied up the kitchen, took rhubarb out for dessert later on, and then got busy up here on the computer. I've been making notes for my blogs and was able to catch up with them completely which was great. If I get too far behind I just never seem to catch up.</p>
<p>I called the girls and Candy said they were on their way out to Walmart. Uncle Frank woke at that point and said he wasn't hungry, would get himself something hot to drink, and rest a little longer. I suggested that it might be fun to show up at Walmart and surprise Candy and Beth. So, off I went. I walked around and around for almost an hour, called Carol, who called Beth on her cell phone; she said they were on their way and almost there so I hid out of sight close to the door, hoping to surprise them. The pool toy area got boring pretty darned quickly as I waited and waited and waited. I called again and Carol couldn't get hold of either Beth or Paul on their cells, so after having them paged once more, I gave up and headed home.</p>
<p>Uncle Frank was on the computer and told me he had been very naughty. He had a big grin on his face though and I smiled as he told me he had cooked himself <strong>two</strong> fried eggs (after insisting yesterday that one scrambled was enough), <strong>two</strong> pieces of turkey bacon (one was all he would have yesterday), one slice of our delicious bread, and half an orange instead of orange juice. I was delighted that he ate exactly what he felt like; as much as he wants to keep his weight down he is no doubt missing eating just a little more food too.</p>
<p>I hadn't had lunch and it was almost 4 P.M., so I cooked a bowl of oatmeal and enjoyed it with a piece of toast as well. Uncle Frank was busy on the computer when I walked in, so when I made my tea, I curled up in the living room with it and my book. It was so dark and dreary with the rain that I turned on the lights and settled in for a good two hours.</p>
<p>Dinner at home, about 7:30. We had a "smothered" veggie burger on a slice of toast, topped with a combination of sauteed mushrooms, Vidalia onions, and red pepper. On the side we had cucumber spears and carrot sticks, with rhubarb and custard for dessert. We have decided we should eat this every day so that we are through last year's crop before adding more to the freezer from the now-ready-to-be-picked rhubarb at the side of the house.</p>
<p>Just as we were drinking our tea/hot water (for me), Candy called inviting us out to Beth's. Mark's parents had been visiting today, had just left, and there was some cake for dessert. By the time we got there at 8:45 it was dark and rainy, but the ride out to the house, on the long and deserted lanes, was really lovely, with lots of woods along the way.</p>
<p>Everyone was home... Beth, Paul, Candy, Carol, Mark, and Michael. Beth was coloring and streaking Candy's hair, Beth coloured and did hers, and Carol put streaks in Michael's. I took lots of photos and we just howled at some of them. Candy was trying to look glamourous and decide which side of her head her now bright red hair should be parted on; the faces she made while trying to be serious had us all in stitches. We did have tea and a small slice of the delicious cake, and left much later than we planned to, arriving home at 11:30.</p>
<p>Despite having decided to being in bed in a half hour, we took our port into the living room. Big mistake. It's much too comfortable in there. We had opened the delicious port Bryn had collected from Brent during my last last hour at home last Sunday; it's very very good and we took our time drinking it. Finally Uncle Frank picked up the crossword book again, we started in on that, had a terrible time trying to fill in one corner, and ended up with more done than the other night... but it was 1:20 when we headed upstairs!</p>
<p>Lights out for me at 2 A.M. and slightly earlier for Uncle Frank.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/a_lazy_sunday_and_dinner_out.html">A Lazy Sunday and Dinner Out</a></h2>
								<p>We had rain overnight, so the air felt fresh and cool this morning. Uncle Frank is still missing clear blue skies and sunshine, both of which have been absent since his return.</p>
<p>I had the whole morning on the computer, since UF slept on and on until 1 P.M.! By' dropped by with the two dogs to invite us for dinner tonight; I suggested that UF have the time with the family on his own (Jess' is just back from school in London), and I would arrange to spend some time with a friend.</p>
<p>I caught up on all the blogs since arriving here. Keeping notes in my calendar and checking sent emails made it easy to remember our days and evenings, and I had time to answer a few emails and update my address book on the server as well. My time was very well spent and I was glad to have it. Amelia had written again as well, so I am up to date with her too. Susan says she enjoys hearing back from me, so that makes it fun.</p>
<p>Uncle Frank and I had a generous omelette for our brunch at 2 P.M. I was so busy I hadn't even thought about food all morning, so we both enjoyed our late meal... sweet onions, red pepper, mushrooms, swiss chard, and cheddar cheese in the two eggs. We had only one piece of the small ww toast, as UF is to be at By's at 5 P.M.</p>
<p>Uncle Frank had a note to write to the therapist next door to take into the Shaver clinic with her tomorrow; we are all hoping that she can get UF in for some physio work before the two or three weeks she had originally said it would be. This has been very disappointing for him, as he thought it was all set up and that he would be at it last week.</p>
<p>I tidied up the kitchen and then sat and finished off the Carl Hiassen  novel I started on Tuesday. I brought some magazines with me as well to read through and discard, so got started on the first one of that pile.</p>
<p>I called Toronto, hoping to talk with all four children, but had no answer there, and there was no message on the machine when I came in. Seems odd to be so close and yet have no more contact with them than I do when home... in fact, less, since we don't have Skype here.</p>
<p>At 5 P.M. I dropped UF off at By' and Jo's. The sun had finally come out and they ended up eating on the deck. I had called Marie and invited myself for dinner; we sat and chatted and then Graham went out for a square pizza... not very saucy or cheesy at all, but more like thin toasty bread with a little tomato paste on it, but it hit the spot and it was fun to catch up with their lives and look at Marie's latest photo pages. This is a woman who is completely caught up on all her albums!</p>
<p>UF called at 8 o'clock saying he was ready to leave; he had forgotten to leave the letter for Donna next door for the physio, so rather than drop by Beth and Paul's for an impromptu visit, as I had thought we might, we came home. Donna said she would do her best and see if she can't get UF in earlier; he's ready to head back to Denver for the second surgery.</p>
<p>Off we went to the A&P, the grocery store open 24 hours a day, very close by. We had a long list of groceries to buy, in anticipation of cooking up three slow-cooker dishes, restocking on fruits and veggies, and buying some canned goods as well. It seemed like a lot of groceries for the house, but Candy will be with us for meals Tuesday through Friday and we are eating most of our meals at home. We took our time and strolled the aisles, which was great, as we spotted the canned custard we like with our rhubarb and a few items we would have forgotten. I unpacked them all and the cupboards are now well-stocked. </p>
<p>We had our now smaller glasses of port (we went through the first bottle far too quickly and are determined to make the delicious one from Brent, via Bryn, last longer), struggled over a few more words in the NY Times Crossword book, and headed up to bed at 11:15. I checked email quickly, and crawled into bed with my latest book, "Prodigal Summer" by Barbara Kingsolver. Read until midnight... UF still up at the computer.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/into_the_second_week_in_ontari.html">Into the Second Week in Ontario Already!</a></h2>
								<p>Time sure does fly when you're having fun, and I seem to have fun wherever I am. It's hard to believe seven days have passed since Uncle Frank and I arrived in the Falls. We've accomplished so much and we hope to get lots more done in the next three weeks. </p>
<p>I awoke at 9:30 today; UF slept until 11:30. He doesn't like sleeping this late but he obviously needs it. Hot cereal for breakfast this morning with fruit, toast, and tea. </p>
<p>We headed out the door at 1 P.M. to run a few errands, but didn't finish up completely before heading home to meet up with Jessyca at 2 o'clock. She is giving her grandad some advice on paint colours for his bedroom walls, and trim in the office. They had a little visit before I joined them; when she left at 2:45, we set off to get UF's hair cut at the Five Corners. I found a celery green linen blouse at "Winner's" while waiting for him.</p>
<p>Off to St. Catherines then; I dropped UF off at "Chapters" so he could do some browsing and walking around, as he did in Denver for exercise, and I went next door to Costco for household supplies, and specifically to buy camisoles, one of the two things I forgot to pack in my rush to Denver. An hour later I joined UF, he bought a book, and we were home to unpack and have dinner by 6 P.M. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank enjoyed his dinner so much; he thanked me two or three times for it during the evening. We had baked lemon-crusted tilapia (ready to pop in the oven; I still don't handle raw fish), sauteed swiss chard, a cob of delicious corn, and caprese salad, his very first. He liked it so much, and we still have lots of the tiny balls of soft cheese for many more meals. </p>
<p>We were reading at the table after dinner... UF his new book, and I finishing the morning paper, when I started working on the crossword in the paper. It was very rewarding to get three or four words immediately and not take that long for one of the NY Times words; UF joined me and we spent perhaps an hour finishing it up. We were stumped on one small corner of the puzzle but finally got it done. Yahoo! That took care of our puzzle for the evening. </p>
<p>UF went online to choose a painting for his room and to make arrangements to have it made into a poster; he has chosen a Van Gogh painting.</p>
<p>Candy called and we had a very long chat about her day and plans for the coming week. She will be here tomorrow afternoon while Beth is at work. </p>
<p>It was a good day today since I heard from most of the family. To start, I had a long newsy email from Kelly. Myk' and Bryn are at the music camp in Orillia; both of them were two of a very small number of students from within the Toronto School Board to be chosen to go. They will be home on Saturday. This will be an exciting and unique week for them. Kelly and Gregg had a great day on Sunday with just Bry' and Caillie, a day at Ontario place while the others were at camp. </p>
<p>Amelia wrote again today; what fun this is, as I can send her off a little email each time in response. Susan has been great about sending off photos, so I can see that little face and share her with UF. </p>
<p>Bryn called through on Skype and we also talked for a long time, talking about taking Riku to B.C. with us (Doug and me) if and when we go this summer. Mirei was sitting on Bryn's lap as we talked and ended up dropping off to sleep! </p>
<p>I could hear Riku chattering away in the background and Bryn put the headphones on him, so it was a little easier to hear him. He asked me at one point if I was coming home soon. Hard to know what "soon" is in his mind. </p>
<p>All is well there; Bryn is picking him up from school and Riku naps in the car. Riku told me he liked the movie they saw on the weekend (with Kevin, Amelia, and his dad: "Over the Hedge") and it was so good to hear his little voice filling me in on what he has been doing. We sang a little together before he had to go to bed... a couple of verses from "Old MacDonald, and finishing up with a few lines from "There's a Hole in the Bottom of the Sea". </p>
<p>UF was busy writing emails during this time, so after reading for a bit in the kitchen, I just took his port up to him, and sat down to read in the living room with mine. I guess he was feeling a little guilty about my drinking alone, as we've had our little ritual going for some time now, and so he joined me. It was a nice ending to our day; I checked my emails and wrote a couple of little ones before going to bed at... where did the time go????... 1 A.M.! </p>
<p>I am enjoying the Barbara Kingsolver book so much I managed somehow to stay awake until 1:45 reading.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/the_great_white_hunter.html">The Great White Hunter</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke at 9 A.M. today, a much more reasonable hour(!) and Uncle Frank awakened an hour later. I wrote up my blog, answered many emails, and had time to talk to Candy on the phone before having breakfast with UF. He announced that he was down to 159 pounds today!, and so deserved a non-"Denver breakfast". He requested two fried eggs, one piece of toast, and two slices of bacon; I cooked up a little sauteed tomato for him too. I have not lost three pounds since arriving home, and so had porridge instead. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank was once again busy on the phone making appointments with his two doctors here, and more calls for service work to be done around the house. He is getting so much accomplished and feeling so good about it. </p>
<p>The plumber was here at 12:30, followed shortly thereafter by a fellow about the eavestroughing job. We had a late-ish lunch... soup and a half sandwich for UF and an egg salad sandwich for me. </p>
<p>In no time it seemed that Paul was dropping Candy off, around 3:30. We headed out almost immediately to Rainbow Gardens for pink impatiens, pink begonias, and geraniums for the front gardens and two planters. We took our time wandering about choosing the best of the lot, and Candy, Gail, and I chipped in to buy Beth and Paul a rhododendron as a "new home" gift. We also loaded eight bags of red rock for UF's side pathway, dashed home to clean up and unpack everything, and left immediately to pick up fish and chips for dinner outside on the deck at Gerry and Lionel's. They had been invited here, but the idea of eating at someone else's house was very appealing. It was hot, they have a shady gazebo up, and big fan too! </p>
<p>The fish and chips were delicious, and we took over a big bowl of rhubarb and custard to share for dessert. We had so much fun and laughed so much. Lionel and UF posed in their matching Tilly hats, being ever so silly. We all admired their new computer and huge screen, oohed over photos of two year old Tanner, and then cracked up watching Lionel, complete with a big butterfly net, trying hard to capture a wayward moth in the kitchen! I took lots of photos so have proof of all of the above. We also worked a crossword puzzle, with all five of us contributing. What a grand evening we had; we left about 10:30, came home, and sat chatting in the kitchen finishing up the crossword puzzle UF and I had started at lunch. </p>
<p>At 11 P.M. I drove Candy to the bingo hall to meet up with Beth after work. She was just cashing out so we all had some time together until she finished that up. Home to UF, made him some Sleepytime tea (no port for either of us tonight!), and went to bed at 12:30 A.M. to read.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/all_day_with_uf_and_candy_too.html">All Day with UF, and Candy Too!</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke at 8:30 A.M. after waking earlier from a most disturbing dream; I didn't feel I could shake it off by getting up, so went back to sleep for an hour, waking in a much happier state. UF was awake soon after, and we had a bit of a rushed morning. Cold cereal for breakfast, and no time for a leisurely sit at the table reading the paper. </p>
<p>We had promised to pick Candy up at 10:30, and it was an hour later when we finally got out there. The dinner menu tonight is "Steak Diane", done in the slow cooker, so we had taken the extra time to get this going before leaving. UF sliced the mushrooms, I did the onions, and he finished off the rest of it with soup and spices. I also had to take the eight heavy bags of red rocks from the back of the car, and we gathered together the tools for the planting at the cemetery.</p>
<p>We took the highway out to Lion's Creek Road, and then enjoyed the long slower stretch of Yokum Road. Driving out to Beth and Paul's (and Carol's and Mark's) is always a pleasure. Beth had sent photos through of a huge and muddy snapping turtle this morning, found not too far from their house. UF said it was almost a Denver morning, if the sky had been just a little bit bluer. We took a different route back into the city, driving along Montrose Road until we hit Thorold Stone Road, and on to the cemetery.  </p>
<p>While UF fetched the water, Candy and I pulled the weeds and planted the pink impatiens and allysum at AR's stone. Then it was around the corner and down another path to Mom's and Dad's, where we planted pink impatiens between the three healthy green hostas, and put down a thick layer of small white stones. I watered a couple of other plots as well, as the sun was hot and the new plantings drying out. </p>
<p>Home to clean up and have lunch. I made Candy and UF tomato, jalepeno, havarti cheese, and olive sandwiches, and made myself an egg salad sandwich. UF finished off the chicken noodle soup from yesterday, and we relaxed over cups of tea. </p>
<p>Next came the bigger job of planting the front of the house; we planted two dozen begonias under the small tree, with UF edging and digging the holes for us. Next Candy spread some peat moss and fine mulch, and watered each hole, while I placed the pink flowers. The lamp post was next, a bigger job since there was a dead bush Candy pulled out while I weeded and UF edged again. We ran out of pink impatiens for this area so after cleaning up, and Candy planting one of the two planters with geraniums and a spear of tall green, we came in for a cold drink and a snack for UF. </p>
<p>Off we went again for more flowers. Gerry had called telling us that impatiens were on sale near Zeller's and UF found two of the five rose bushes he wanted for the back there as well. Had a long shopping spree at Canadian Tire for a new hand-held shower head for the bathroom, a new spray faucet head for the kitchen sink, a box of six solar lamps for the front pathway, and plastic containers for some of the dry products we have bought recently. UF also bought sealant for a leaking basement wall area. </p>
<p>Dinner was quickly ready after cooking some egg noodles, beans for UF, and slicing up tomatoes for caprese salad for all of us. I had two small canneloni for dinner. UF was so pleased with the slow cooker meal; both he and Candy said it was delicious, even though in our rush we forgot to halve the amount of onion and dry mustard! </p>
<p>We sat over the daily crossword while having our tea, a tough one with two or three words we thought we wouldn't get at all. However, while Candy and I were busy with other things, UF managed to figure out the long word giving us trouble. </p>
<p>The rest of the evening passed quickly... Candy and I put out the garbage and recycling and played a game of cards, while UF did some sorting in his office and a little emailing. Then he and Candy sat and visited in the living room, while I answered a couple of emails and wrote up my blog. I had my port upstairs while UF had his in the living room with Candy. </p>
<p>Other news: Gail was in the hospital last night for a few hours with a terrible pain in her chest and back; she had 13 nurses trying to get an I.V. in for Gravol and two nurses tried for a blood test after that. She arrived at eleven A.M. and left at 4 P.M. in the daytime, not the night. They finally eased the pain and she went home with a diagnosis of what they felt might have been a large gas bubble. </p>
<p>Amelia has written me another email; she and Riku had another fun hour together this morning before Riku headed off to school. She and her mom were also over at Rhode Island Street gardening (lucky me!), with Amelia busy playing in the yard, and on the big train upstairs. Doug flew to New Jersey last night for his annual PEA meeting. He's away until Sunday night.</p>
<p>Bed too late... 12:30, with the light out in our room at 1:15 A.M.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/a_rude_awakening.html">A Rude Awakening</a></h2>
								<p>Well, this will teach us to not go to bed so late; the eavestroughing workers were here at 8 A.M., pounding away outside our bedrooms. I got up immediately; UF woke up at 8:30 and Candy, who had trouble falling asleep last night, slept in until 9:30. We all thought we would be exhausted tonight, but we still managed to stay up later than was wise. </p>
<p>The morning flew by with the usual routine; breakfast together, rather late, and then an early lunch, as Candy and I went off to a funeral service for the mother of a friend of Jan's and Glenn's. She was very supportive of Glenn when our parents died, and when Jan died as well. The service started at 1 P.M., and somehow, despite going to the wrong funeral home and dashing downtown to the right one, we made it just in time. We went to the cemetery following the service, and had a little time with Glenn, Wendy, Becky, and Wayne. We took the time to water the newly planted flowers at Mom's and Dad's gravesite, and at Auntie Rita's as well. </p>
<p>Oh, just as I had prepared our lunch, the phone rang. It was a very old acquaintance, Judy Armstrong, from my "Honeymoon Gift Shop" days, when we were both seventeen years old. She and Gail reconnected a few years ago, after the death of the woman who had been our boss; they had both been in touch with Mrs. Hartley for years at Christmas, and her kind daughter passed on Gail's name and address to Judy after her mom died. We have been in touch via email as well now for about two years, and what fun it was to hear her voice this morning!  </p>
<p>After the ceremony at the cemetery, we went home to Uncle Frank, and almost immediately went out to St. David's to buy four more rose bushes, all beautifully scented and quite a good size, white impatiens, and alyssum.  </p>
<p>We had heard that "Lococo's", in "Silver Town", had a great price on asparagus, and other veggies, and since none of us has ever been there (they are celebrating their 100th anniversary this year too!), we drove there and bought lots of goodies: corn, tomatoes, asparagus, avocado, and mushrooms. Home to unload it all and then sat and had hot cups of tea and two cookies each. Yum! We were ready for it. </p>
<p>Time to drop at By's and Jo's for dinner at 6 P.M., while Candy and I met Sheldon and Donna at "Chatter's" for a most delicious dinner (pizza for the girls!), and lots of laughs. We picked UF up at 8 P.M., drove to Jepson Street, and had such a good evening at their house. What a good time we have with them always! I had a small glass of Bristol Cream (I think!), we had tea, and planned to get together on Sunday for a girl's night at their lovely home. </p>
<p>Came home and worked on our crossword  puzzle until too late again... 1:20! ... and I still read before turning out the light.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/a_gardening_day_and_an_evening.html">A Gardening Day and an Evening Out</a></h2>
								<p>Candy and I were out in the garden this morning before UF awakened. It was perfect for it. We weeded, lay red stone on the flower beds, mulched a couple of others, and Candy planted a few more flowers. Uncle Frank and Auntie Rita always decorated the front of their home so beautifully, and for the first time since Auntie Rita's death, there is a tiny wicker tricycle by the front door, with a pot of flowers on the seat, and a tiny child-size bench. Later in the day a little boy from across the street was chatting with us, and I thought how AR would have been his best friend on the block if she were here with us still. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank had a doctor's appointment at 1 P.M., so at noon I came in quickly, made lunch for us, tidied up and managed to get there on time. Candy stayed home to finish up some outside jobs. All went well with the doctor; UF really just wanted to fill him in on the results of his surgery, but he had very good results from his blood work... cholesterol and blood pressure both low. UF says he is in great shape, from the belly button up!</p>
<p>We had tea and cookies and went immediately outside to get back to work in the gardens. Uncle Frank had bought some "pagoda" lamps, which use solar energy to light up the pathway at night, and he placed those while Candy planted geraniums and I planted the rest of the flowers under the windows, and white impatiens in the front bed. We were busy right up until 6 P.M. when we had to stop and get ready for dinner out with Gerry and Lionel. We weren't really ready to stop, but it was a good thing we had to, as we were all tuckered out from the fresh air. We accomplished so much; the front yard looks amazing! I took lots of photos and can't wait to see them online. </p>
<p>We drove out to the Lane for dinner at Mick 'n Angelo's, a very popular and busy spot. We had to wait forty minutes to be seated but it was worth it; the food is plentiful and delicious, and enough for generous helpings to take home too. Lionel and I both had angel hair pasta with mushrooms and spinach and asked for tomato sauce with it; Candy had it with the original garlic and olive oil. Gerry had a delicious looking eggplant parmigiana, and UF enjoyed every bite of the half of his linguine carbonara. Soup or salad came with the meals, again with very generous portions, and hot crusty bread. Yum! It was loud but we enjoyed it all anyway. </p>
<p>Gerry and Lionel came back for tea and there was rhubarb and custard for those who wanted it. We also worked together to finish off last night's crossword puzzle; Lionel is very good at them, and UF always manages to get the tougher ones, while Candy and I do our best. Gerry came up with one tough one that had us stumped, and that led to the finishing off of the last problematic corner. </p>
<p>They left for home about 10:30, so after checking emails and puttering about for a bit, the three of us sat down to do tonight's puzzle, a much easier and shorter one. We were feeling pretty smug, thought we would get to bed earlier, and somehow that didn't happen... computer time, checking out some photos online, chatting, etc., etc. I went to bed at 1:15, Candy was already turned over to sleep, having finished her book the night before, and Uncle Frank was at the computer when I said goodnight. I read until 1:45. Insane. </p>
<p>Dad died nineteen years ago today; he was on our minds today, and Candy and I talked about him as we planted the flowers. It is hard to imagine that so much time has passed.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/a_beautiful_day_for_gardening.html">A Beautiful Day for Gardening, and a Family Gathering...</a></h2>
								<p>Uncle Frank was up, showered, dressed, looking perky and fresh, and sitting at the computer when I wandered out of my room at 9:30. He said he was awake at Denver time, which was 8 A.M. Amazing, but he hadn't slept enough... </p>
<p>Candy got up right away too, and UF waited until after 10 for breakfast. Of course he said he was starving, and I suggested that he could have eaten some cereal on his own; his answer was that he enjoys being waited on and was not going to miss out on even one opportunity to be so. </p>
<p>The plan last night was for Candy and me to be outside planting five rose bushes while Uncle Frank slept in, but plans were foiled by our laziness. We had a quick breakfast of cereal, fresh mango, bananas, and toast, and then sat chatting away for another hour or more! It's hard to get started at all our jobs, but once we do, we keep at it. Having this time together to just relax and chat is every bit as important as finishing up the job list. </p>
<p>I cleared up the kitchen, and Candy installed a new hand-held shower in the main bathroom. She said it should have taken ten minutes (she's an old hand at these jobs), but had trouble with the connection not leaking. Soon all three of us were in the bathroom, offering help wherever we could. UF finally managed to tighten the top connection, and we were ready for some outside work.</p>
<p>It was quite cool this morning, and we all had jackets on. Of course, once we started digging holes in the rocky soil for the roses we warmed up soon enough. It was a big job, as Candy especially had lots of red rocks used for ground cover over the years, that had sunk down into the soil at the left, door side of the area. I was luckier with the centre of the bed, but when we finished it off it looked just gorgeous. UF kept busy filling containers with water and plant food, and of course figuring out just where the roses should go, and telling us exactly how far down to plant, etc. Candy said she is learning lots! </p>
<p>From there we went back to filling up the shady area by the garage with more of the red rocks UF had dashed out to buy on his own yesterday, his first solo car trip since before leaving for Denver in April. </p>
<p>And then around 1:15 P.M. Candy left us. Beth is claiming her again, as she is off work for three days. She was at a funeral this morning and early afternoon, so we had Candy with us longer than we thought we would. We were not happy letting her go, but Beth will be happy to have her back with her, and won't be working her nearly as hard as we did here. However, Candy will be back with us on Monday night and painting is on the schedule for her then! </p>
<p>Uncle Frank and I had big lunches today, our leftovers from dinner last night. I cooked up some fresh asparagus to go with it, and UF had me try honey with cucumbers, something he learned from a Serbian co-worker many years ago. It was delicious! Try it! </p>
<p>After lunch, Uncle Frank looked more tired than I have seen him in a long time. His poor muscles have really been working hard these past few days, with all the bending, dragging, lifting, and walking too, back and forth through stores and the yard. He took two muscle relaxing tablets, curled up in his bed, covers pulled up to chin, and fell into a deep sleep for fifty minutes. </p>
<p>I called the children at Kelly's, leaving a message for Myk' and Bryn about their concert today in Orilia, and catching up on emails and my blog. </p>
<p>I had to waken Uncle Frank at 4 P.M. and hated to do so, but he had asked me to do this. We were to have been at Beth's and Paul's an hour ago, and it was time to make our way to McKenney Road. He could sit in the sun over in their lovely yard and be waited on. We left the house at 4:45, taking a new route. This took us only seventeen minutes, and we were behind a very slow and very big tractor, adding possibly three minutes to the trip. Despite the new road being faster, we decided we really did enjoy the slower drive along Hokum Road, so we could feel we were in the country for a longer time. The newer road takes us just two minutes away from their house. </p>
<p>Gerry and Lionel were already there, and we all sat outside in the sunshine-y breezy day, watching the finches and robins, and were lucky enough to spot a hummingbird at the feeder. Beth had made up some appetizers, and we had taken a shrimp tray out, so we sat in the sun with our drinks, nibbling away at the delicious treats... ham rolls, the way Ian taught her to make them, two types of cheese, mixed pickles, and the shrimp. </p>
<p>Rina, their dog, is so happy living out here. She is red and white and is just gorgeous; it's such a sight to see her running around this huge property and getting all the exercise she needs. I think she might be happier than anyone else with this new house! I had lots of fun throwing little bits of bone or coconut shell to her, which she would dash off and look for, with great intensity, until bringing it, sogging and yucky, back to me again. </p>
<p>For our dinner, Paul was busy barbecuing chicken breasts, Beth cooked up a big pile of corn-on-the-cob, and Candy had made the most delicious asparagus lasagna after getting there this afternoon. I have the recipe and will be making it at home. We sat at a table under the gazebo for dinner, until it got a little chilly when the breeze picked up. </p>
<p>We went into the house for tea and Gerry's date squares for dessert, warmed up and served with vanilla ice cream. They were a big hit this way and Beth and Lionel had suggested it. Shel' and Donna came by not much later, and we spread out into the dining room, living room, while Shel' and Lionel watched most of a hockey game in Beth and Paul's bedroom, just off the dining room. </p>
<p>We "girls" wanted a group photo of us taken, so we talked the reluctant trio into taking lots of photos of us, using all available cameras. It was quite the photo shoot, and the guys now feel that photographers aren't paid enough. We laughed and hooted our way through dozens of poses. Donna, Candy, Gerry and I sat on one big sofa, while Beth lay across our laps, doing her Marilyn imitation at times, which the boys thought was too funny, until we had them do the posing. UF, Sheldon, and Paul sat on the sofa while Lionel stretched out across their laps. What a riot this was! We have some fabulous shots. </p>
<p>We finished this off, to the groans of the men, by setting up two of the cameras with timers for a group shot of all of us. I think I was up and down about sixteen times, pushing the buttons and dashing madly back to sit on the floor with the "girls" and look composed... sort of. Oh, did I mention that we had all tried a new liquor? Oh my, was it good; I will be buying a bottle of Amarula Marula Fruit Cream to take home, or seeking it out in SF! </p>
<p>We had such a wonderful time and, as always, lots of laughs. We missed Ian and Lisa who were too tired after a busy day to come out (they're having a garage sale tomorrow), and Glenn and Wendy, who are at their trailer this weekend. </p>
<p>We were the first to leave, at 10:30; Lionel and Sheldon had to watch the last two minutes of the game... which takes longer than two minutes of course. Candy and I had pulled the little tabs on the solar lights this afternoon, so UF and I were hoping that we would see them glowing in one of the front gardens when we came home. We did, and they looked very pretty indeed. We strolled around for a few minutes admiring the results of our hard work. </p>
<p>A crossword puzzle finished off our evening perfectly; it took a little longer than an hour. Uncle Frank had his "Sleepytime" tea, and I showed him a few photos of Amelia on Susan's blogs, read Kelly's email about Myk's and Bryn's very successful and happy week away at music camp, and went off to bed. I turned my light off at 1:15. We have no idea how it gets so late so fast around here! UF was still up too...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/spa_sunday.html">Spa Sunday</a></h2>
								<p>Awoke at 8 A.M. today, and had two hours on the computer before Uncle Frank got up. Answered lots of emails and wrote up my blog. We had a very leisurely morning, not eating until noon hour; I made asparagus omelettes with red pepper, Vidalia onions, and cheddar cheese. We shared a very juicy mango, and UF said we must get more, as he so enjoys them in the morning. They were only 79 cents each at IGA last week, a price that is especially good here. UF says they are often almost $2 each. </p>
<p>We had intended going to a nursery for more red rocks, but instead, while Uncle Frank was on the computer, I did some laundry, and ironed almost all the clothes waiting for me in the basement, including clothes Candy forgot to take to Beth's on Saturday. </p>
<p>After that we started a crossword puzzle left from Thursday, when there are two in the paper. It proved to be a tough one, with lots of short but difficult words. Gerry was to have picked me up at 3:30, for our "spa day" at Donna's, but Candy was delayed while running errands in town with Beth and Paul. This gave me time for tea and a date square with UF, while working on the puzzle. </p>
<p>The spa day came about because last week Donna called everyone, wanting "the girls" to do something together. Dinner out was suggested, or a trip to St. Jacob's market, but it was Jamie's forthieth birthday yesterday so the latter was out, and we knew we would have more fun if there weren't restrictions on our time or really kicking back, as would be the case with a restaurant meal. I suggested a spa date at Donna's, as they have a lovely huge bathroom with a big whirlpool bath, and a beautifully decorated recreation room on the same level. </p>
<p>At 4 P.M. I was waiting in the front of the house when Shel' showed up; he and Ian have plans with Uncle Frank for the time I will be out today. </p>
<p>Gerry drove out the back way to Beth's and Paul's, turning on Lundy's Lane and meandering about the back roads. I lost track after three turns including a wrong one, but it was a pretty ride nonetheless. I just don't know my way around these back roads at all! Candy was waiting, and I saw Isaac with his newly dyed black hair (I like it, although no one else does... except him), and Michael with his newly streaked hair. They are having a pool day at their Neena's today, so Beth can't join us. She said she hoped to, but none of us had faith that it would happen. </p>
<p>Donna is a wonderful hostess and had snacks already laid out, wine cooled, the hot tub full and ready, and candles lit in the bathroom and the rec' room; it really looked (and smelled) lovely. </p>
<p>Candy, Lisa, and I got in the tub immediately; we had scented bubbles and with our legs stretched out carefully there was just room for the three of us. Candy and I had put a scrubber/exfoliant on our faces as we soaked too, and we had our wine beside us. The timer went off too soon for our liking so took a double turn. Donna let us get away with this, but told us she did have other clients waiting, and this would be the limit for us. </p>
<p>Donna, in her white top and navy pants (she had been golfing from 8 A.M.) looked the perfect spa attendent, and would come in occasionally when the laughter got a little too riotous, checking to see if all was well. Meanwhile, Gerry and Wendy were chatting and snacking in the rec' room, awaiting their turn. </p>
<p>Pizza and chicken wings had been ordered for dinner, so they decided to soak after we ate. We went upstairs to the lovely space they have off the kitchen, and stretched out on the sofa, chair, and floor, admiring Donna's brand new "waterwall", a new addition to the house. Shel' said it couldn't stay in the house all summer, as they have a dehumidifier running in the basement, but it did make a perfect addition to our spa experience today. Candles were also lit upstairs, and so the ambience was just perfect as we chatted and ate and laughed. It's just a good thing "the boys" weren't around! </p>
<p>The water wall has a copper roof on it, and somehow the topic came up about how to keep it clean once it goes outside. Candy said that she would show Donna how to do so easily, and promised a demonstration, if Donna had some ketchup! She ordered Donna to sit down, ordered me up to be her sidekick, and had me smear ketchup on half of a copper bottomed pot. I smeared and smiled and gestured while Candice went on about the wonders of ketchup and her vast knowledge of cleaning tips,  and then we went off downstairs again, to let the ketchup do its job. </p>
<p>Gerry and Wendy got in the hot tub next, and what a riot this was. They had fresh water and had more than their fair share of bubbles; they were everywhere, threatening to overflow the tub! The two of them started laughing, and with a hectic and stressful weekend behind her, the two glasses of wine Wendy had soon had her in stitches with the bubbles. Of course we were taking photos of all of this, so the two of them starting taking down the straps on their suits and posing with heads thrown back, looking rapturous, with bubbles up to their necks. Oh my, it was fun and funny! Can't wait to send those photos out... </p>
<p>Finally, we were all seated in the rec' room together, with Gerry and Lisa soaking their feet in the foot baths. Candy massaged Lisa's and Gerry's feet, and then it was time for Donna to relax. She kept insisting that she was there to take care of us, but we would have none of it, and insisted that she have a turn too; she hadn't gone in the bath. How she protested, but once her feet were in the swirling warm water she moaned away. She had foot surgery a couple of months ago and has really suffered with her feet over the past year or more.  I massaged her feet and lower legs for a long time, and she had us all in stitches with her moaning, and by telling us that she has never felt so wonderful and relaxed, etc., etc. Five minutes later she would be saying the same thing; it was hilarious. The pressure on her toes and up her arch were just so obviously pleasing, that I must say it was a pleasure getting such a reaction from her! </p>
<p>Beth came in just as all of this was going on, eyebrows raised, wondering just what Donna was moaning about! We were so surprised that she actually made it, and cheered when she came down. She so rarely takes the time out for herself either, so we soon had her feet in hot water too, and after a nice soak I massaged her feet for her. </p>
<p>About 8:30 P.M., feeling none the worse for wear(!), Wendy had Glenn come and pick her up, and Lisa left next, after we had Sheldon take some group shots of us upstairs. We started calling out words to make us laugh while he was using my camera, which turned out not to be a good idea, since he was laughing so hard his hands shook, and my photos are all blurry! Thank goodness we were behaving while he used Candy's camera as he got some great shots of us then. </p>
<p>At 9:30, Gerry, Beth, Candy, and I left, taking the highway this time out to the house. Gerry dropped me at home a half hour later. As we pulled up here the moon lights looked just beautiful in our perfectly decorated gardens. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank had been home for an hour, after a lovely afternoon and evening for him. He and Shel' had sat in the living room here and talked for a while; Sheldon brought over some four pound leg weights, and showed UF how to use them to strengthen his leg muscles. UF was quite impressed with them and plans to use them three times a day. Then he and UF met Ian at "Mick 'n Angelo's" for dinner. This is the same place we went to with Gerry and Lionel on Friday, and gave UF the opportunity to try the stuffed green peppers which had caught his eye then. Sheldon ordered the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer, which UF liked so much last fall when we ate there together, and with the big salad and hot bread, he brought most of his dinner home with him, enough for at least two very generous meals! Sheldon also has enough food for a nice big lunch today. </p>
<p>They all went back to Ian's after dinner, and UF thoroughly enjoyed this time with his two nephews; it doesn't happen often enough. Ian is also so gracious in his home, and a great host. UF had a Scotch there while they visited, and Shel' dropped him off at home at 9 o'clock.</p>
<p>When I arrived home, UF proudly showed me the completed crossword puzzle he had finished during his hour alone. It was a challenging one for sure; I wasn't sorry that I didn't have to think after my relaxing few hours! Since UF had a beer with his dinner and a drink at Ian's, we didn't have our port tonight. We do have a new bottle we picked up a few days ago, but instead might open the ice wine from Donna and Sheldon sometime in the next few days. </p>
<p>We had promised each other that we would start getting to bed earlier, so after two cookies each, and some "Sleepytime" tea for UF, we headed upstairs at 11:15. I wanted to check my emails (not checked since about 2 P.M. today), so UF said he would check his quickly while I washed. I emptied the dishwasher, folded laundry, washed, flossed and brushed, and got my bed ready, and UF was still busy on the computer, answering emails. </p>
<p>I came in to say goodnight, and was in bed reading at 11:45. UF apologized, feeling guilty about taking so long, but he had lots of mail in, and I was happy to just crawl into bed with my book. Lights out at 12:02! Yahoo! What a grand day we had...</p>

							<div class="entry">
								<h2><a href="/2006/06/a_very_quiet_monday.html">A Very Quiet Monday</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke at 8:15 this morning and UF just an hour later; UF weighed 157(!) this morning, just two pounds away from where Dr. Hadley, the local heart specialist, suggested many years ago that he aim for. He said he never quite made it, and was told he would be skinny at that weight, but he looks great. His reward? A glass of OJ, mango and grapes, two scrambled eggs, two slices of turkey bacon, stewed tomatoes, two slices of toast with jam, and his green tea. </p>
<p>I called Riku at 7:35, catching him just out of bed. He still sounded sleepy, and I called back just before he was leaving for school. We had only a few minutes to talk, so I promised to call back tonight. </p>
<p>Not long after UF ate, he went back to bed. He thinks his shower was too hot this morning and he felt light-headed. He was up an hour or so later, feeling just fine, and made some phone calls and checked his emails. </p>
<p>It was a quiet day at home, despite our intention to get out and run errands early. I kept busy by doing some laundry, cleaning out the fridge, puttering about and reading. We had a late light lunch, and sat at the table trying out the crossword puzzle from the Toronto Star; it's much harder than the Niagara Falls Review puzzle, and we kept at it for an hour or more. </p>
<p>Off to run those errands at 5:30. We had groceries to pick up for Nea's visit here on Thursday, and spent lots of time in Canadian Tire buying hose parts, painting supplies, and a few household items, and then drove to Mullen's Garden Centre for more red rocks for the garden. They didn't have the small ones, so it was Rainbow Gardens next, passing by the house on Ash Street, just for old times sake. It's still not sold. </p>
<p>Dinner was the latest ever; we were both very hungry, but I had a big dinner of wild salmon, sauteed swiss chard, half a sweet potato each, and an ear of corn. UF had his last date square from Gerry for dessert. </p>
<p>I cleaned up, called Riku back and learned he had a new monster, bought in Japantown, and I sang a little bit of a song for him. He asked me if I was coming back soon, and when I heard his voice it seemed not soon enough... still two weeks and two days to go. I know it will go by quickly as it hardly seems possible I have been here for two weeks already! </p>
<p>Bryn said he and Akane both think that Mirei is looking not quite so big these days. However, as he was telling me this, he said she had looked up at him and gave him a look as though wondering how he could look at her and say such a thing! We talked a bit about the possility of Doug and I taking Riku to Vancouver with us next month. If Doug isn't working we will do this. </p>
<p>I called Amelia too, catching her in the tub the first time, and interrupting a new movie the second time. She was gracious enough to talk with me for a bit though, and told me she had taken her "monkey baby" for a ride in the train at our house, and played in the garden. I will be happy to be back and seeing them all again. </p>
<p>I curled up with a book in the living room reading for an hour while UF was on the computer; he came down for his night time cup of tea at 11 P.M. and we finished off the Review crossword. I was in bed with the lights out at midnight.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/lost_keys_and_fish_n_chip_tues.html">Lost Keys... and Fish 'n Chip Tuesday</a></h2>
								<p>I set off at 9:30 on this gorgeous day to pick Candy up at Beth's. I found them both sitting on the porch; what a picture! Beth took me out to the bush area and led me down a wide winding path that Paul is making for the children. They are going to love it; one day it will be lined with 100 tall white pines he is planting along the way. </p>
<p>Beth and Candy had planted some flowers yesterday, so I had a look at all of those before heading off with Candy to pick up paint at Benjamin Moore's on McLeod Road. We drove by the house on Ash Street, of course, on our way back here. </p>
<p>We set to work on the painting immediately... all the woodwork in UF's office, to set off the lovely pale sage green paint that was done a few months ago. Candy and I both sanded the bathroom ceiling over the tub in prep' for painting as well; UF decided we needed more sand paper, went to get the keys for the car, but they were missing from the usual spot in the kitchen. </p>
<p>That set off a search for hours and hours, with no results at all. It is very frustrating as I had them last, as far as I know, and only walked into the kitchen and onto the bedroom before getting busy with the bathroom work. All of us took turns searching the car, the garage, our purses, under the bed and car, on shelves, in the garbage containers in the house, in "headbump", in pockets, etc. Nada. </p>
<p>Candy and I prepped and painted the woodwork off and on, stopping for a light lunch with UF, and tea, mid-afternoon. Of course, in between every stop and with each step we took, we were looking for them. </p>
<p>Gerry picked us up at 6 P.M. for dinner at her house; we could have eaten here more easily, since she had to drive us in both directions, but I had a horrible headache and wanted away from the scene of the crime. We spent three hours on Sheldon Street, eating our delicious fish and chips, enjoying every bite of the lemon meringue pie Gerry had made, and drinking tea. Lionel was with us for less than an hour but we all worked on the Niagara Falls review crossword, making a very good and efficient team, and then worked a smaller and easier one before leaving.</p>
<p>Home before 10 P.M., searched again, had our first glasses of port in a few days (Candy abstained), she and I played cards while UF was on the computer, and then it was bedtime... at midnight. Perhaps I will dream about the whereabouts of the keys!</p>
<p>This just in from Bryn:</p>
<p>Mirei is officially a flipper! She did her first unassisted flip at the studio on Tuesday morning. She can now do them at whim and very quickly too!</p>
<p>She has also discovered that she can hammer her various toys against a nearby wall to make a noise.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/candys_last_day_in_nf_and_a_fa.html">Candy's Last Day In NF, and a Family Gathering</a></h2>
								<p>I dreamt about finding the car keys last night but, alas, it was only a dream. Throughout the entire day, with every job we did, we all had our eyes open for the keys, to no avail. </p>
<p>We had breakfast with Uncle Frank before starting the second coat on the office trim. Candy says she is going to miss our long chats over our meals; we never rush through them, but relax and visit before getting on with our to-do lists. </p>
<p>However, we had lots on the lists today, so soon Candy and I were upstairs putting the second coat on the trim in UF's office. Candy dabbed a little green paint on the nail holes she had filled yesterday, and then we wiped down his desk, I vacuumed thoroughly, and we rehung the freshly washed curtains and toppers. His office looks terrific!</p>
<p>We also looked for a small sander so we could do the bathroom ceiling, but I found it too late in the day to do any of it. We had already hung the freshly washed curtains in there by the time we found it. Candy was so thankful, as it wasn't a job she wanted to do anyway; it may well turn out to be a much bigger job than she could have finished to her satisfaction in one day. </p>
<p>Candy and I both had to shower before going out to Ian's and Lisa's, so that job has been delayed. I might tackle it next week after Neal has returned home; he arrives tomorrow evening. </p>
<p>We put off lunch until after 1 P.M., at which point Gerry and Lionel arrived. They did a big search for the keys too, inside and out, but while they were here the phones were acting up. Two had dial tones, two didn't, and only the phone in the rec' room would ring. Lionel traced the wiring, and finally took the phone from the rec' room and put it in the kitchen. The problem seems to be that phone, but strange things are happening around here!  :)</p>
<p>At UF's request, I called his dealership to see about getting a new key. The news was not good; we would have to have the car towed there for them to program a new key. Then I called CAA, who came quickly enough, but with the bad news that the car might suffer some damage while they towed it out backwards from the garage. The tires would be locked, would burn rubber for certain, and UF was concerned there would be more damage than that. </p>
<p>Finally, late in the day, UF called a locksmith, who told him if he could sweet talk the dealership into giving him the code for the car, he could cut a key for him. So, UF did just that... called the owner of the dealership, an old high school friend's of Neal's, who promised to send someone over in the morning to program and cut a new key. What a relief! </p>
<p>Candy had planned to cook lamb chops for their dinner tonight, so Gerry had kindly driven her out to pick those up, I finished up the vacuuming of UF's bedroom and Nea's room, tidied up the painting tools, and after Gerry and Lionel left, went out to the garage to sweep and clear out all the recycling bins and garden debris we had collected over the past week. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Candy was busy (thermally) insulating all the wall switch plates in the house, managing to finish them all but the rec' room and three double sets. It's a slow tedious job, but she was very efficient at it. UF is just amazed with her "manly" skills and told her so many times. It is so wonderful having her here with us; we hate to let her go but will do so tomorrow morning. </p>
<p>While Candy cooked the lamb, I took a lovely hot shower. I was pretty tense with the key situation, and the new showerhead has a massage unit on it. Ahhhh... 'twas lovely! </p>
<p>I cooked new red potatoes and asparagus to go with our dinner, and prepared three tomato and boccoccini salads with fresh basil. We had to rush dinner a bit for the first time, as Gerry and Lionel were picking us up for an evening with Lisa and Ian. Not having a car really puts a dent in our independence! </p>
<p>Ian managed to get home early from work tonight, so arrived to greet us, Glenn, and Wendy, at about 8:30. That boy is such a delight; he walked in the door with his big grin, making us all feel welcome, as does Lisa. She had a table beautifully set up with hot and cold snacks for us, lots of drinks to choose from and "read" our cards too... all but UF's tonight. </p>
<p>Lionel, Glenn, and UF were casually watching the game between the Edmonton Oilers and the Carolina Hurricanes, but were still chatting and being social while it was on; Edmonton won 4-3 after going into overtime. </p>
<p>Home after a series of group photos, of all but Glenn and Wendy who had left earlier. I got photos of the two of them though, and just before leaving Ian posed for us in his Commissioner's uniform and two different hats, one of which was a sombrero that Lisa brought him home from Spain. </p>
<p>Lisa, by the way, is as tanned as can be, mostly a result of sitting in a fishing boat all last week, her first fishing experience and one she enjoyed very much. She and Ian had taken a week off to go to a cottage and had a grand time. Each time I am in her company, I am so grateful that my brother has this wonderful partner in his life... and we get to share her too! </p>
<p>Bed much too late; UF had his tea and Candy got ready for bed, and then at 1 A.M. suggested we at least start the crossword puzzle so she could help out a bit. We went to bed a half hour later, chatted until almost 2 o'clock, with the alarm set for 5 A.M.!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/car_keys_and_freedom.html">Car Keys! ... and Freedom</a></h2>
								<p>Candy had set an alarm for 5 A.M. but woke on her own twenty minutes before that; good thing too, as the alarm didn't go off at all. I joined her in the kitchen at 5:30, after she was packed up, ready to go, and drinking her coffee. We had a final half hour together before Gerry picked her up; I took a couple of photos, waved goodbye, and crawled back into bed. I left the light on and read and dozed until 8:15. </p>
<p>We were expecting the fellow from the car dealership to arrive this morning and so UF was awake early too. We had cold cereal and toast for breakfast, and were delighted when the fellow showed up with the key code and had a new key made in less than ten minutes; now we wish we had called yesterday! What a liberating feeling, knowing we could just pick up and go under our own steam from now on. </p>
<p>I had a little time on the computer while UF showered and talked with his sister Nina, who had called to see how he was doing. I went off to finish placing the red stones in the front garden, and watered the plants in the front and back gardens. </p>
<p>We were waiting for John to show up for the trimming UF wanted done; he came with his brother and in no time at all had done a great job taming the bushes and overgrown shrubbery, but alas, also managed to cut through the cable lines. We were having lunch while this happened, and I waited until we were on our way to see Dr. Fulton in St. Catherines before telling UF. John assured us they would come out to fix it up but of course we have no idea when that will be. </p>
<p>Despite leaving later than we planned, we were just a few minutes late for the 2:30 appointment. Dr. Fulton is quite a character, and a ladies man for sure; he had me come into his office, lay face down on the single "bed", while he demonstrated how I should "pull" UF's leg to loosen up some bone fragments. His receptionist was there too for the demonstration, and she went first. UF said this movement helped him, but Dr. Fulton has a lot of upper body strength and it hurt my ankle. I was glad to have the treatment over with! </p>
<p>From there we drove to Sears to look for a storm door, which they no longer cover. However, while waiting to learn this, I sat down to enjoy a massage pad, which felt just wonderful. UF tried it next and right on the spot decided to buy one. Turns out they are going on sale tomorrow, so we shall be back.</p>
<p>Neal is coming home with By' tonight, and he and UF are invited out for dinner at By's and Jo's; I was invited as well but decided to spend some time with Marie instead. We had just enough time to get out to Lococo's for fresh veg' and fruit, and then dashed home to unpack and start to mix up the pumpkin and spices for the two pies UF always makes for Nea' when he comes home. They arrived at just past 5:30, so we put the bowl in the fridge to finish up later and went our separate ways. </p>
<p>It was too close to dinner time to call Marie, and I decided I would love some time to wander around Niagara Square. I am so glad I did, as I found some great cotton capris and bought three pairs, as well as three sleeveless T-shirts. The dollar store was nearby, a huge one, and I found lots of goodies for the SF children: books, sparkly Play-Doh, animals, and tissue paper and other goodies for the house. </p>
<p>Tried to contact Marie, with no luck at all, so had a portobello mushroom burger at the A&W before heading home at 9 P.M. I was surprised UF and Neal weren't home, tried the key in the lock, convincing myself it didn't work (and I didn't want to force it), so did a little more mulch laying before they arrived fifteen minutes later. </p>
<p>Almost as soon as I got in, Kelly called inviting me to come to Toronto and do the 5K walk for prostate cancer with them all on Sunday morning. I will go up tomorrow at some point and spend one night with them all, returning to the Falls Sunday evening. </p>
<p>I filled the pie shells and made tea, Neal went off to bed, and UF and I did a crossword puzzle. Determined to get to bed earlier tonight, we said goodnight at 11:15. However, I took the time to take all the labels off my new clothes and had a little fashion show just for me. I love my lime green capris! Bed to read and lights out at 11:45 P.M.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/the_queens_coach_and_a_very_ni.html">"The Queen's Coach" ... and a Very Nice Surprise</a></h2>
								<p>Woke up this morning at 9 A.M. and with no Internet connection yet, the morning passed slowly with time for reading the paper, and chatting with Neal. </p>
<p>After UF arose and had his shower, it was overtime for our first meal of the day. Breakfast at "The Queen's Coach" is always Nea's first choice for all of his meals in the Falls; it's a very popular local spot, and apparently has been for years. We've been told that our Grandfather Rodgers used to drink there with friends after work, many many years ago. Friday night fish and chips there is a family tradition for many locals, and it's not unusual to run into someone you know no matter when you are there. </p>
<p>It was very quiet by the time we arrived at 11:30; the breakfast rush was long over and the lunch hour not quite started. Neal had a cheese omelette, UF the breakfast "special" of scrambled eggs with bacon and onions mixed in, and I my usual "basic" breakfast wherever I am, of two eggs over medium, homefries, and here... Italian toast. </p>
<p>We were sitting talking over our tea and coffee when a familiar face walked in... Elizabeth, Harry Lee's first wife, and mother of Kelsey! We recognized each other immediately and she came over and gave me the longest and biggest hug. Her dad has recently died, she is off work for a couple of weeks and told me that in going through some things in the house she had come across some of the letters I had written to her and to Kelsey many years ago. Elizabeth said she had oftened wondered how we all were, and of course I am always asking Ian or Harry how she and Kelsey are; I was sorry to have lost touch when she left the marriage. She seemed as delighted to have reconnected as I was, gave me her contact information, and I promised to get in touch next week. Elizabeth looks the same and was with her husband for lunch; I am hoping to see Kelsey too when I see Elizabeth.</p>
<p>We stopped at the local hardware store on our way home to look for a few more coleus for the front bed, to no avail, but did buy a new outdoor mat for the front door, and batteries that were on the list.</p>
<p>Neal and I worked a little more on insulating the wall plates while UF was busy on the computer; we were waiting for John to arrive to do some work in the house, but after a bit Neal asked about seeing Beth and I suggested that he and I scoot out while UF was waiting. UF agreed readily, and so off we went for a ride in the country. We timed the miles on the trip last week to pick Candy up, and it is exactly 11.4 miles from UF's garage to the end of the driveway at McKenney Road. </p>
<p>Neal's first words when he saw the house? "It's a mansion!" Beth showed him around the house and around the grounds while I took the opportunity to check my email downstairs in the cool office. It's a hot day today, but we sat in the shade on the porch for a half hour after I pulled a few weeds in the front beds. There was a lovely breeze blowing that we didn't have in the city.</p>
<p>Beth has a few "Rodgers" plants planted in the front flower beds,and we are all waiting to see what they look like when they flower; Beth found them at a nursery last week and Candy plans to get some for her house too. Carol drove Beth into town at 2:30, a little earlier than Beth usually leaves, so we were glad we had had some time with her.</p>
<p>John hadn't shown up, so UF left a message cancelling the work for today, and we all drove off to St. Catherines to pick up the massage mat UF had decided on yesterday. They had put one aside under his name, so that took only minutes and we were on our way back to the Falls immediately. </p>
<p>UF usually takes By' and family out for dinner on Friday nights, but they were busy with Jo's family tonight. Neal was keen on a second meal at "Queen's Coach," so 6 P.M. found us sitting in the same booth where Elizabeth and her husband sat this morning. I had the fish 'n chips (I like them better at "A Fine Kettle of Fish"), and ate the salad that came with Neal's spaghetti. UF had chicken cacciatore with penne, Italian bread, and salad, and brought half the main entree home with him for another meal. </p>
<p>People are <strong>big</strong> in Niagara Falls! We see lots of them at this restaurant but had it confirmed in the paper last week; Niagara Falls has more than the average numbers of smokers, overweight adults, and a higher illiteracy rate than the average Ontarioan. UF said that one look around the restaurant makes it easy for him to eat only a half portion! </p>
<p>At 7:45, UF and I were just heading out the door to the Bell Centre at Niagara Square to check out a new phone for him, when Glenn and Wendy walked up to the back door. It was lovely to see them and they came in for tea and pumpkin pie. First, though, they both did a walkaround of the garage, backyard, and house looking for the car keys for us. No luck, but we enjoyed the hour plus visit with them. Neal continued to put the light plates back on the wall in the rec' room, which I was cutting out and putting together while we chatted. </p>
<p>Neal went off to bed at his usual 9:30-10 P.M., and UF suggested I write my blog before we had our port. I did so, and was very pleased with it, and then lost it after changing <strong>one</strong> word and not saving it! Egad! We sat in the living room relaxing for an hour and I went right to bed instead of trying to redo it. I did make some brief notes though so it could be done later... </p>
<p>Special event! Amelia had her first BM in the toilet today! Susan sent the sweetest photo of a very proud Amelia flushing the toilet, so I took the time to write to Amelia telling her what a big girl she is. She has been quite a faithful little emailer and I had another in from her today as well. </p>
<p>Happy 34th Anniversary to Candy and Rick, who are settled into a lovely B&B tonight.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/niagara_falls_to_toronto_3.html">Niagara Falls to Toronto</a></h2>
								<p>I was awake at 8:15 this morning, showered quickly, made both beds, and quickly sorted through my various belongings to pack up a full bag to take to (and leave in) Toronto. This will save me having to take two big bags on the bus when I leave here in ten days. To my surprise, UF and Neal were sitting at the table, having finished up scrambled eggs, prepared by UF, for their breakfast! He hadn't found the bread in the fridge so it had been a very lean breakfast for UF, especially today. There were eggs waiting for me in the oven too. UF was keen to get out to Niagara Square, as I had promised him last night we would go out for the phone before I left for Toronto today. </p>
<p>Neal came with us for the drive, and UF chose his first set of cordless phones, with two units for the kitchen and his bedroom. As soon as they are hooked up he will have a new answering machine as well, as part of the kitchen phone. We stopped for a few groceries on our way to the bus terminal; Neal drinks lots of milk and eats three yogurts at a time, so the dozen we bought on Thursday were almost gone this morning. </p>
<p>They dropped me off at 11:15, leaving me time to cross over to the Chinese restaurant across the street and get an order of veggie-stuffed tofu-skin rolls, and a Coke, for my lunch. The bus left at noon, and I had two seats to myself to spread out, read, and do a few crosswords, while enjoying the views from the air-conditioned bus. </p>
<p>Kelly and Caillie picked me up after my arrival at 2 o'clock. Caillie was her usual bright and perky self, and chatted all the way home. It was great to be back and to see all the children; they were all home and looking great. Bryant had had a sleepover last night, as part of his birthday event, and there were several boys sitting around the table on the deck, still eating and talking. The party was to have ended at 11 A.M., after a late sleep-in and a huge breakfast prepared by Gregg, but there they still were at 2:30! Gregg drove them home shortly after this.</p>
<p>Caillie and I played a word game, and then I went through the fabulous album Kelly had made Bryant for his birthday. Next up was her completed album of their trip to the Grand Canyon for Kelly's fortieth birthday last year. What a wonderful album it is, with not only lots of great photos of them all, but accompanied by lots of detail about their trip down and back up from that amazing canyon. This took a long time to read, and Caillie told me how nice it was that I read it; interesting comment, and perhaps it will encourage her to do lots of writing too. </p>
<p>Bryn went off to Sean's birthday party at 4 P.M. and Kelly, Gregg, Bryant, Caillie, and I walked around the corner to Clare's 30th birthday party; she is a friend and a member of Kelly's CM team. Myk' was grounded last night, with phone and computer privileges taken away for some time, so she stayed home, walked the dogs, and kept herself busy in her room. Meanwhile, the rest of us were sitting on a newly-built deck, filled with many of Clare's friends, and all of their gorgeous children, almost all of them two-year-olds. </p>
<p>The food was just fantastic, with some great cheeses, assorted dips and veggies, and later the best corn salad I have tasted. Clare has promised to send the recipe on to Kelly, as she just discovered it herself last week at a party. Yum! Dessert was spectacular, with a chocolate fountain, and a massive plate of fresh fruit. Bryn and I agreed that the oranges and chocolates were a great combination but the fresh strawberries were wonderful too.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the evening, a two-week-old baby girl arrived and Bryn was in his glory, holding her for about twenty minutes, inspecting her toes and hands, and stroking her cheeks and head. <br />
  <br />
We all left at 9:30, as tomorrow will see us out the door as close as we can make it to 8:30 A.M. The children went to bed, I checked my emails, and after Gregg went to bed at 11, Kelly and I stayed up too late... until 1 A.M., chatting. We have so little time alone but tomorrow morning will come too soon for both of us. Kelly is fighting off a sore throat; she has lots on her plate as usual!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/team_dedo_and_a_happy_fathers.html">"Team Dedo" and a Happy Father's Day</a></h2>
								<p>I had a lovely snuggly sleep with Caillie, and to my surprise woke at 7:10. I wanted to get in the shower before anyone else and be ready to go on time. It's hard to get this many people out the door in such a short time! I had time, though, to quickly check my email, before making oatmeal for Myk' and me, and she and I peeled and cut up fresh cucumber, carrots, and celery for the backpack. I popped in a few slices of sourdough bread, some of the three loaves I had brought from SF for them all. Thank goodness I hadn't left them in Niagara Falls, as they were all keen to have it. Kelly had a yogurt and her toast in the car, as we dashed out the door at 8:45. </p>
<p>Back in SF, Doug had spent the greater part of the day with Bryn, Akane, Riku, and Mirei, with breakfast out, and lots of time at Tilden Park in Berkeley, riding the train our Toronto children love so much, and exploring a nearby lake. </p>
<p>The main event today was a 5K walk for prostate cancer, starting near Ontario Place. It began at 9:30, and we were there in time for fresh pastries, delicious and tiny bran muffins, and bottled water, before beginning our walk. It was hot already and the little patches of shade were more than welcome. Caillie was having a hard time with it at first, as bedtime was too late for her last night, and she dragged along, being reminded once or twice about how much easier this was than the Grand Canyon walk! We finished in exactly one hour, collected our free t-shirts, and posed for a very friendly fellow taking free digital photos for the event. He also took a couple with my camera so I shall have a copy too. </p>
<p>Kelly and Gregg had collected $420 in donations, a very good total, considering they had only heard about the walk last week. Next year they hope to have t-shirts with "Team Dedo" on them, in tribute to Gregg's dad, the children's "Dedo", who has had prostate cancer and is a survivor. We saw so many people walking in honour of their dads, brothers, and grandfathers, and were surprised to learn that 1 in 7 Canadian men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetimes, and of those seven, one in four will die of it. </p>
<p>Along with our free admission to Ontario Place for the day, came a free healthy lunch as part of the walk. We collected our brown-bagged lunches, and sat on tiered seating, enjoying whole wheat bagels, along with single servings of peanut butter, jam, or cream cheese, a piece of fruit (banana, apple, or orange), a small oatmeal bar, bottled water, various flavoured yogurts, and bagged tiny carrots with dip. </p>
<p>And then it was off for the fun! What a wonderful day I had with them all; the children went through some buildings on their own, and then we all went down the log ride. I always forget how much I really do <strong>not</strong> like that long upward climb on the ride, knowing full well it is going to be a much steeper downward slide down than I like! I screamed, much to the delight of the children, and especially Myk' who chose to go down with her hands in the air. I meanwhile had white knuckles and was happy to get off, wet and relieved to be alive. Bryn talked me into this ride last year too! One day I will remember I don't like it a bit... </p>
<p>The afternoon flew by... we all had ice cream but Bryn, who preferred a "beavertail" covered in cinnamon sugar. The children and parents spent lots of time in the various water venues, while I lay on my back on the grass, watching the clouds float by, enjoying the undersides of the green leaves on the tree over me, and hoping that none of the gulls would drop any offerings on me as I lay there. </p>
<p>Kelly came by to talk me into going on the "pink" water ride with the girls. She offered me her suit but I decided I didn't mind if my clothes got wet; she assured me I wouldn't get any wetter than I did on the canoe ride. Hah! Turns out there are <strong>holes</strong> in the bottom of the rafts and you <strong>sit</strong> in about four inches of water at the beginning of the ride. I was nervous about the ride as we had to climb a long way up to get to the top of it, but both girls assured me it was not scary and it wasn't... it was just such fun and I enjoyed the gentle bumps and twirls the raft made on the way down to the bottom of it. Next time I will take my suit along though; I was soaked and ended up taking my cotton pants off, hanging them on the fence where Kelly and Gregg were sitting to wait for the children, and throwing on a towel around my waist. This worked just fine as the sun was hot and the slacks were dry in less than an hour. </p>
<p>Bryn and I went off on our own to play mini-golf, and he won by a stroke. Darn! The others were getting into dry clothes and we left around 5 P.M., hoping to get a roti at a spot on our way to the bus terminal. No such luck on Sunday, but I had time to buy a fully loaded grilled veggie "dog" from a street vendor outside the bus terminal and sat inside eating it before getting the bus at 6:15 for the Falls. </p>
<p>Kelly had called Glenn, after getting no answer at UF's, and he and Wendy were there to pick me up just after 8 P.M. UF, Neal, and By' were all home, but the new phone hadn't been hooked up, and so there was no message waiting to pick me up. By' and Jo' had bought UF a great new highbacked chair for his computer, and it is perfect. Just last week UF and I had been talking about looking at a new one for him. </p>
<p>Neal and I sat downstairs watching a show on the Queen's official 80th birthday party, and saw lots of footage of her over the years. After By' left, UF joined us for a while. I made our tea, Neal went off to bed about 10 o'clock, and UF and I had port in the living room. I turned out my light at 12:15.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/monday_already.html">Monday Already!</a></h2>
								<p>In just ten days I will be home; I cannot believe how quickly this time away has gone, and yet it seems forever since I have seen the children in San Francisco. </p>
<p>I woke at 9:10 this morning to find Neal and UF both still sleeping. I took advantage of the time alone to catch up with my blogs and read all my neglected emails. Uncle Frank was up an hour later and showered, giving me another half hour to type madly away. At 11:45 we quickly left the house for breakfast at ... yup, "The Queen's Coach". Neal won't even consider going anywhere else; the waitresses are very friendly, the space is open and not crowded feeling at all, and he likes the scrambled eggs and the cheese omelette.</p>
<p>Today I asked him to order the Italian toast, even though he doesn't eat it, so that I could have doubles. The slices are small and the bread is such a treat that I happily ate four slices with my two eggs. No potatoes today; breakfast is a bargain at $1.50!</p>
<p>We drove to Chippawa right after our late breakfast, to check out a screen door for the back of the house. UF took his time looking it over carefully, and then drove to a second place closer to home. He liked the door there a lot, but was appalled at how highly priced they are. I asked if we could stop at Fairview Cemetery so I could water the plants on Mom's and Dad's stone, as it was hot and dry for the past few days. UF and Neal had been to AR's twice this weekend, so the one stop was all that was necessary. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank was feeling a little drowsy, so we dropped him at the house and drove to Beth's at Neal's request. He really enjoys sitting on her porch and listening to us talk; he doesn't say too much, but seems perfectly happy to be there. Rena tried to keep him interested in tossing her a piece of bark mulch, but like everyone else, Neal soon grew tired of her boundless energy. Rena needs a young puppy around to keep her busy! We were getting ready to leave just as Carol pulled up, and before we said goodbye, Paul arrived home as well. </p>
<p>A storm was brewing as we left at 5 P.M., and even though Neal really wanted to go to "Queen's" again for dinner, he didn't like the idea of dragging his dad out in the now pouring rain. He suggested we could possibly eat at home, and was more than keen to do so when I told him I would make him spaghetti with tomato sauce. UF and I both had leftovers... UF his chicken cacciatore with penne from the other night, along with a fresh cob of corn, I a portion of Chinese food I had picked up on Thursday night, before the trip to Toronto was planned. With some fresh mushrooms and a generous amount of fresh asparagus I was a happy camper. Neal ate every bite of his pasta, and thanked me several times for it. </p>
<p>As soon as I cleaned up the kitchen, I got out the massage pad UF had bought late Friday afternoon. It had been busy enough that evening, and then rushed on Saturday morning before I left, so that it hadn't been unpacked. I was sure that UF would have had it going on the weekend, but he and Neal were busy, and so he finally got to use it for the first time tonight. It must have been very relaxing as I left him sitting against it, and Neal just tiptoeed by to tell me that his dad is sleeping. Yup, he's curled up on his bed sound asleep; I'm not surprised, as he felt tired all afternoon (else he would have joined us at Beth's). He would have liked to have seen the two climbing rose bushes he bought for her on the weekend. </p>
<p>I sat with Neal downstairs in the rec' room; he had CNN on, so I watched a bit of that with him while keeping busy with a crossword puzzle from last Friday. At 9 P.M. I decided to wake UF so that he would sleep tonight, but he was just coming out of his room as I headed up the stairs. Neal said goodnight then, and I made UF a cup of his nighttime tea. We sat downstairs as well, and after a little TV time we finished up the one puzzle together and got started on Saturday's as well. UF does amazingly well at coming up with words, while not having access to the sheet, something I just cannot do. It must be a spatial thing. </p>
<p>Bedtime at 11:30...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/running_around_and_a_quiet_eve.html">Running Around and a Quiet Evening Out</a></h2>
								<p>We were all up at a fairly decent hour this morning; I had decided to send Neal and UF off to breakfast without me, as I miss our fresh fruit and lighter breakfasts. I offered to make breakfast here, and was very surprised when Neal agreed, as he is very fond of the time out in a restaurant and the friendly waitresses at the "Queen's Coach". So, we all started off with banana halves and fresh mango, Neal had his eggs with ketchup, UF his usual cereal, juice, toast, and green tea, and I had cereal and juice as well. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank got busy once more trying to get the new phones working, and then settled into his office for emails and phone calls. I did a few small loads of laundry and stayed downstairs ironing until it was all done; UF had some winter shirts hung up from before his trip, and I was behind in my own few blouses, so that was a good job done in the cool of the morning. </p>
<p>UF and I dashed off to Niagara Square after that to get the phone looked at; the gal who helped us at the Bell store, Kerry, was just wonderful and very attentive to UF and his questions about the phone. Of course it worked the minute she plugged them in, but there was something to do with crossing the phones onto the opposite stands after charging that did the trick. UF liked her so much that he almost made her an "honourary niece" after their half hour dialogue about the phone. She was great and so friendly, and UF said on the way home that he almost hoped the phone wouldn't work so he could go back and have her be friendly all over again. We haven't had much luck with helpful or more than just doing-their-job clerks lately. </p>
<p>We stopped at the A&P on the way home to stock up on a half dozen yogurts for Neal, knowing he must be hungry waiting for us. We needn't have worried as he had gone to the back of the fridge and found the tiny and most delicious yogurts Candy had left, completely ignoring all the various flavoured puddings that UF had bought him before his visit. </p>
<p>He had three more yogurts while UF had soup and a whole sandwich (put japepeno havarti cheese on anything and UF thinks I am a gourmet chef!), and I had a sandwich and tea as well. </p>
<p>Neal declined a trip to Costco with us, happily returning to sitting in the vibrating chair downstairs watching TV. We needed just a few more supplies for the house, and I bought Glenn some pistachio nuts after seeing how disappointed he looked when I gave Ian his a few days ago. We had a little time at home before going our separate ways for dinner... UF and Neal to By' and Jo's, and me out with Amelia (as Amy prefers being called now... our Amelia inspired her to use her given name). She pulled up just as UF and Neal were leaving, so they had a chance to say hello; UF and Amelia have met but not Neal and Amelia.</p>
<p>Amelia had heard of a good Chinese restaurant in Chippawa, so off we went. We were the only two people there at 6:30, which was surprising as the food was very good. They have no tofu on the menu, but we shared a shrimp chow mein, and a really delicious thin and tasty noodle dish with lots of mixed and fresh vegetables... no canned mushrooms here! We sat eating slowly, devouring every last bite, even though the plan had been to take half of it home for lunch tomorrow! We had lots of catching up to do, though, and the time flew by for us. A half hour before we left, another group came in, four young women, and sat in the booth behind us. They turned out to be a family Amelia knew, as her eldest daughter and one of the gals had been best friends through high school. I took advantage of this and after they had been talking and catching up, had one of them take a couple of photos of us just before we left. </p>
<p>Home at 9 o'clock. We were sitting in the living room for about fifteen minutes before Neal and UF returned. UF sat with us and visited for a bit while Nea' changed into his PJs and sat in his favourite chair in front of the TV. Amelia left soon after that and I joined Neal downstairs. UF joined us for his tea, then UF and I went up to the kitchen and worked half a crossword puzzle over our port. We stopped long enough to just chat before heading up to bed. I tried to look at Candy's photos, but the computer bogged down on me, and kept freezing so I finally had to give up and get to bed. Hope it's all working in the morning, as UF had had trouble earlier too. Oh, Jo' had made ribs for dinner from a recipe book that UF had brought them back from Denver. He confessed to eating more than the Denver Diet really allows.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/strawberries_and_roses_and_a_b.html">Strawberries and Roses... and a Big Mess!</a></h2>
								<p>This was an almost perfect day; Candy being here to share it with us after our busy week last week would have made it perfect.<br />
 <br />
Before leaving the city, we stopped at Avondale to pick up three more yogurts for Neal; he had polished off the final three last night, and he will miss lunch at his place in Hamilton. Even though he insisted he would be fine 'til dinner, he finished all three once we got there. </p>
<p>Neal lives in a big and very beautiful former private home in an area of Hamilton that has been designated heritage property. The large home he is in is surrounded by the most beautifully well-kept brick and Tudor homes, all perfectly landscaped, as is his. </p>
<p>Judy, the chief cook and housekeeper, came out to the car as Neal was eating his yogurt, and invited us in to have a tour of the home and to see Neal's room. UF has been here before but had only been on the first floor. Everything is very tidy, organized, and in place. Neal showed us where he sits at the table for six, their TV room, and kitchen (dinner was going to be beef stew; Neal quietly, and with a grin, kept begging to come home with us!)</p>
<p>Neal was concerned about his dad climbing the narrow and winding stairs to his room (the back stairs from the back of the house), but they have good solid hand rails and he was fine. We met all of his housemates but one, who was out for the afternoon. Peter is a tall and  gentle giant of a man, the newest member, having arrived only six months ago. Kathleen, an older woman, has been there for six years. And the friendliest of the bunch (whose name I have forgotten for the moment) was so sweet, throwing her arms around both UF and me when she was introduced, and then taking me into her airy double room, and showing me the photo of her 16-year-old son. He lives up north in Owen Sound and plans to go to University next year. She had lots to say, and whispered how none of them like Judy, the gal in charge.</p>
<p>Three young children live in the house too, on the third floor with their parents, who own the business. The children are 2, 4, and 6 years old, and occasionally come downstairs to visit with the residents. I, of course, took a few group photos of Nea's housemates; they all seem very nice and we met the fifth one coming in. She told me it was just as well she wasn't home for the photo as she was in no mood to be photographed anyway.</p>
<p>The house has lots of character, was built about eighty years ago, and still has many of the original pieces of beautiful furniture in the various rooms, and paintings and prints on the walls. We went downstairs using the much wider front stairwell, with its beautiful wood banister, leading to the front door with leaded glass foyer windows.</p>
<p>Nea's room is small, but not tiny, and very very tidy. UF was very surprised and pleased to see everything in order; Neal immediately set to work putting all his things away before coming out to the hallway to chat with everyone. They were all happy to see Neal home again.</p>
<p>Before leaving, I took some photos of the surrounding neighbourhood houses and the heritage sign, and plan to have a "Neal" album up when I get home. I am just so sorry I didn't get a photo of the three Massard men; I missed my one opportunity last week. UF said there are very few of those.</p>
<p>Neal was sorry to see us leave, and I wished I could have brought him home with us again. He is obviously happy to be free to just wander about at his own speed, eat when he's hungry, get out for some drives, drop in to see Beth, and have breakfast and dinner out. There is no food allowed to be brought into the home by the residents at all, and no access to the fridge either. However, as UF says, he is stable there and treated kindly, which is a much better situation than has been true many times in the past.</p>
<p>UF is after some breakfast or luncheon plates, dishes halfway between bread and butter plates and the larger 10-1/2 inch dinner plates. We had talked about how this is a much better sized plate to eat from when trying to keep the portions Denver diet sized, but they're hard to find. So, we have been talking about visiting some pottery shops in the area; on the way home we spotted a sign on the highway for "Forks Road Pottery" in Grimsby. We had missed the exit, and had to double back to get to it, but what a wonderful place it is! We were lucky enough to run into yet another friendly gal, who walked us through the original railway station, with many lives in between that and the present antique and pottery shop. It is huge, and we strolled very slowly throughout the three big rooms, looking at massive grinding wheels, really old pottery from the mid-90s (not for sale), wonderful old pine furniture, including a fabulous huge blanket box at only $390(!) and so much more. What a bargain the box was; it would cost four times that or more on the west coast, and would easily hold all my extra blankets, duvets, pillows, etc. Does anyone I know have room for it? No. It would be a wonderful piece in a big living room or bedroom though...</p>
<p>I fell in love with one of the patterns of the main potter, one called "the garden". I couldn't resist and bought myself a small plate, and ordered two other pieces as well, which I shall pick up in the fall. UF and the gal chatted a lot about various pieces and we did lots of holding and touching of wonderful old objects; I love Ontario for this reason alone! It makes me long to be back here. I took some photos and on we went, an hour or more later.</p>
<p>On our way to Niagara-on-the-Lake, on Mountain road, we stopped at a fruit stand (how wonderful it is to be here in the early summer and fall!) and bought the most wonderful local strawberries, grown and sold by such a friendly woman. UF had spotted quart baskets for $7 earlier, but these were just $4 and so delicious! We bought two and plan to eat them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for as long as they last.</p>
<p>How Susan would love to be here; there were no cherries to be had, as the few the seller had were gone early this morning... she didn't have enough pickers to collect more. Susan and I could easily spend a few days picking berries and cherries to our heart's content! UF and I must remember to get there early on Friday, as she thinks she will have more by then.</p>
<p>Next stop was at a wonderful nursery in Niagara-on-the-Lake, a spot I had read about in the paper a few days ago. It was in an article on roses, and highlighted this business specializing in hardy and English roses, in particular those called "David Austin" roses, which have been grown for their heavenly scent and large and sumptious blooms... and hardy enough for Ontario winters too. Was this spot worth the drive out there! Once again we had the help of a wonderfully friendly woman, a gal from Switzerland originally; she recognized the name Massard from that country. She and UF had a long discussion about what brought their families to the new country. She and her husband have been running this fruit farm for nine years and every plant is lovingly tended. There isn't a yellow leaf or a wilted rose anywhere in sight and each has an individual little drip system running to keep it well-watered. UF took one look at them and asked me if he had room for two more bushes! The answer really is no, but he stated he would happily toss out two of the ones he has to acquire these. They really were so beautiful, and it was hard to decide which two to choose. Finally we set off, with a gorgeous soft yellow, with new buds about to burst open and one saucer sized bloom, and another soft blush pink, white with pink edges and middle, safely ensconced in the back seat, along with another box of strawberries, these smaller and only $3 a quart!</p>
<p>I had wanted to take Glenn and Wendy out for dinner, in thanks for all the meals and invitations I have had to their home each time I am here. Tonight's the night. The plan was to meet at "Mick 'n Angelo's" soon after 5:30. We were there first, and had a table when Glenn and Wendy arrived. It was such a good evening with them, with lots of talk about family history and searches and stories. UF and I both ordered the angel hair pasta with spinach and mushrooms, with tomato sauce, and now have enough for at least one more meal each in the fridge. However, we are going for dinner with them tomorrow night too; Becky and Wayne will join us, for an early birthday celebration for Glenn. He and Wendy will be at their trailer all weekend. We are really going to have to stay home for the next few days and eat, eat, eat!</p>
<p>Wendy fell in love with our roses and took one of the cards I had for Palantine Nursery. When we opened the car doors to come home it smelled like heaven should smell... strawberries and roses!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we did not come home for the quiet cup of tea and strawberries we had anticipated. The back hose has been dribbling for days it appears, and had soaked through the foundation into the laundry room and downstairs bathroom!</p>
<p>I was out in the garage getting the recycling ready to go out, and UF told me the bad news as he came upstairs with soaking shoes. By' showed up just at the right moment, and was able to get the wet/dry vaccum going, hauling out the wet rugs, which I have dripping on the lawn chairs still, and took an hour to get it all cleaned up. No damage done, just a freshly washed basement floor! They had a fan running up until we went to bed, and it was already dry.</p>
<p>I had taken all of our purchases out of the car, started clearing out the recycling and garbage, swept more of the garage floor, pulled weeds from and swept the front walkway, planted the last of the plants in the front bed, and watered the new plants. Longest day of the year today, so I was out there until almost 9:30, coming in just as it got dark.</p>
<p>Finally, at 9:40, we had our tea and strawberries, finished last night's crossword puzzle (a cinch!), and found another unfinished one in the kitchen drawer. That one was a bit of a challenge in the last corner, and we had our port as we tackled it. Off to bed after midnight again... still no computer time for more than a quick reading of emails... maybe tomorrow... bed after 1 A.M. What a wonderful day!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/robins_egg_blue_and_an_early_b.html">Robin's Egg Blue and an Early Birthday Celebration</a></h2>
								<p>I woke at 9:15 this morning! Good thing as I had read until after 2 A.M. although my guess is that I was dozing off and on for an hour before turning out the light. Uncle Frank slept until 11:30, so I had lots of computer time before showering, making the beds, and getting our brunch on the table. </p>
<p>It was 12:30 when we sat down to eat; UF weighed in at 159 this morning so asked for a good hearty breakfast. I made up lovely big fruit plates, with half a banana each, half a mango, a nice clump of red grapes, and a generous number of strawberries. Yum! UF also had scrambled eggs, turkey bacon, sauteed fresh tomatoes, his juice, and green tea. I had one scrambled egg, one slice of toast, and a few spoonfuls of tomatoes.</p>
<p>UF went off on his own after some time in the computer room in the early afternoon. John was called to come over for some repair and painting on two ceilings; Stephanie was with him, and helped with the ladder while he trimmed the pear tree and dragged two big lounge chairs out of the headbump space. It was hot and humid today and we had turned the air on; working outside was not an option for me. Instead, I did a little weeding right after brunch, then came in and changed the sheets on Nea's bed, vacuumed and cleaned his room thoroughly, ran the vacuum through the hallway, did a load of laundry, and called Marie and Beth to catch up with them.</p>
<p>UF was gone for over two hours, getting the car washed and lubricated, and trying, unsuccessfully, to get a spare key made at a locksmith. He got home just twenty minutes before we were to meet Glenn and Wendy, Becky, her mother-in-law Alice, Wendy's mom, Stephanie, her brother Jonathon, and boyfriend John for dinner at "Lee's" Chinese restaurant at Stamford Plaza. It was an early birthday celebration for Glenn, who will be at the trailer on his birthday Sunday.</p>
<p>Dinner was delicious. There must have been ten different dishes and the owner kindly cooked up a perfect dish with sauteed tofu and lots of crisp and varied vegetables. I loved every bite of it and ate it all; I did have to share a few pieces of tofu with a few people who wanted to try it. Not one of them liked it much; they found it too chewy.</p>
<p>Glenn's main gift was in the trunk of his car for him, a wooden bench that turns into a picnic table to be used up at the trailer. They love to eat in the back, overlooking the water, and have only had a temporary table up to this point. Becky went home right away, John and Steph' disappeared, but the rest of us went back to Glenn's and Wendy's for tea and some time to talk to each other. There were so many for dinner and UF and I were at the far end of the table.</p>
<p>Home by 9:15; UF is reading the paper, and I will join him now for strawberries and some port while we do the crossword puzzle. I want to get to bed early tonight, as I would really like to plant the two rose bushes in the morning before it gets too hot. We have a day out planned, which means I have no idea how I am going to accomplish all the things on my mental list!</p>
<p>... oh, the "robin's egg blue" part. While pulling a few weeds in the front garden this morning, I found the most beautiful tiny robin's egg; only half of it was there but oh my, what a colour!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/goldfinches_purple_finches_rob.html">Goldfinches, Purple Finches, Robins, and Mourning Doves</a></h2>
								<p>One of Auntie Rita's greatest pleasures was awakening to the sounds of the birds outside her bedroom window in the summer. I am sleeping in that bedroom and know exactly just how sweet it is. Uncle Frank has the bird feeders full, and I awaken to their songs, and get to watch them while preparing the meals here. I slept in until 9:15 this morning, and then spent the next two hours on the computer while UF slept in. I finally managed to get through some emails, write up two blogs, and answer some emails as well. I was doing so well keeping up with them the first few days of my trip, but now have well over 200 stacked up, with less than a third of them answered. </p>
<p>We ate a cold breakfast today, but started with a big fruit plate again. Uncle Frank is enjoying this thoroughly, as the strawberries are sweet, the grapes crisp and juicy, and the half banana a regular part of our breakfast these days. He tried on a couple of pairs of pants from his closet after showering and is delighted to fit into pants he hasn't worn in years, all size 36. He's determined not to gain any weight; tomorrow we hope to clear out some of the larger and older pants. </p>
<p>I went out to plant two rose bushes before the day got hotter; they look so beautiful and when UF saw them he commented that he was sure there was room for one more! He's addicted to these new roses and wants as many of them as he can get. Already he's talking about digging a new flower bed in front of the patio for next summer, just so he can fill it with roses. </p>
<p>I continued cleaning the back area, digging up around the bed so the water doesn't run off after watering, sweeping very thoroughly, pulling up each tiny weed growing between the red bricks, moving the table and chairs onto the lawn to clear under them, etc. UF joined me at one point and continued sweeping and weeding, working together until it was finished. We moved out a wooden bench that has been in storage for years, and placed two lounge chairs on the lawn, ready for stretching out on a warm day. Today was hot, and I was glad to come in and freshen up for some errands in the car. It was too late for our intended drive to Wainfleet to see the antique cars, so we will be going tomorrow instead. </p>
<p>We went off to look at a storm door at Home Depot; after finding doors priced at $700 at two independent door makers UF was happy to find one at almost half that price. We had a very friendly man named Joe helping UF with all his questions, and it was a delight to deal with him. They will come out to measure and UF will have a brand new door in three weeks. He was very pleased as he wanted a good solid doorframe, but with full glass, and this fit the bill perfectly at a good price. </p>
<p>It was well past time for lunch, so we stopped at Boston Pizza, next door to Home Depot, and shared a medium pizza with green olives and mushrooms. UF had a half pint of light beer too, and we relaxed and enjoyed our late lunch. Next stop was dropping off cross-country skis and shoes at Goodwill, picking up some dry cleaning, and a last stop for four more bags of red stone. This should be the last of that, as the flower and perennial beds are almost fully covered. We filled in an area between the neighbour's yard and the garage with red stone when Candy was here, and it took a lot of stones to cover this area, which has scrappy grass and too much shade. Placing the last of the stones will be tomorrow's yard chore. </p>
<p>By' was here when we arrived at 5:20; after waiting five minutes for us, he decided to wash his car. This gave UF ten minutes to sit on a chair and watch him, and to take my photo near the car. He even had By' take one too; I felt very awkward posing by the car, but it was a photo he wanted. </p>
<p>We had several things put aside to give to Byron, and the last of them made him very happy. I turned over the four full boxes of photos of him and his family, taken over all the years. Many had been sorted into "events" by Auntie Rita, but there were also thousands of loose photos which were finally separated into these boxes for By' and Jo'. the best of the lot, though, was a fifth flat box, filled with the best treasures: black and white photos of By' as a baby and young child, going on through the years until his early teens. By then, photos were in colour, and they were in the other boxes. However, there were also wonderful old birthday cards to and from Byron, from birth photos to cards he signed (or had signed for him) for Mother's and Father's Days from the time he was a just a little guy. Mother's Day cards he had made, primary report cards, and letters to and from his grandparents in Colorado. What a lucky pair of boys Neal and By' were, to have a mother who saved all these for them. By' was very surprised and said he had no idea his mom had saved any of these things. </p>
<p>They went off for their fish and chip special at the Queen's, and I spent almost four hours with Marie. They have the sweetest little house, and tonight I took some photos of some of my favourite areas inside, collections of old graters, a set of tea cups in a stand in their bedroom, and a collection of birdhouses arranged in the computer room. I showed Marie some of the photos in my albums, and of course we exchanged stories about all the cute things our grandchildren have been saying over the past few months. We had tea, and we even had time for one game of Aces before I left at 10 o'clock. </p>
<p>UF was busy clearing things out of the garage when I got home! I had been cleaning the garage over the past few days, sweeping and tidying, and hoping to have time for some more clearing out. It was so hot yesterday that we decided it was a job that could wait until the fall, but the skis went out at least. However, after his evening out at the Massard Jr's, he had found a few things to take to Goodwill, had By' take the lawn mower from the laundry room, and got lots done. I convinced him it was time to stop for our crossword puzzle and a dish of strawberries. He was happy to do so; we completed the puzzle very quickly tonight, and sat with the last of this bottle of port for an extra fifteen minutes before heading to bed at just past midnight.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/crosswords_and_a_day_out.html">Crosswords and A Day Out</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke at 9:15 this morning, surprised to have slept so late. Got busy going through old emails and wrote up my blog; it was hot already and there is gardening to be done. </p>
<p>UF emerged at 10:15, and went back into his room after saying "good morning". I was certain he was in there using his back massager but he tucked back into bed and came out an hour later, not happy that he had slept so long. He has a hard time sleeping as long as his body needs, and I refuse to waken him unless he has an appointment early in the day.</p>
<p>I showered and went outside to plant the two roses from Palantine Nursery. The digging was hot and one spot particularly challenging (there are a lot of roses in that bed!); I really should have showered after doing this, but I must say the new ones look just gorgeous, and are stealing the show. Then I distributed four big bags of red stones over the back garden beds. We had thought this would be the end of it, but we are still short of really covering things properly. UF will have to decide if he wants to buy more and be thorough, or if this will do the trick for this summer. I finished up by sweeping the patio thoroughly, and pulling the last few tiny weeds from between the bricks. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank decided that we wouldn't go to the antique car show after all, as he had overdone the work in the yard and garage yesterday and was feeling too sore for much walking. Fine with me, as it was obviously going to be a hot, hot day today. </p>
<p>Breakfast was light... a big fruit plate each, with some cereal and toast for UF, and strawberry yogurt and toast for me. UF said it all looked so pretty, that I should take a photo of it, so I did. </p>
<p>After freshening up, we headed out for a full day away from the house. First stop was the Goodwill Store, where we unloaded plastic flower pots, a tin pail, a padded garden hanging basket, a wooden goose mobile, and some stakes for tomato plants, all things UF had decided late last night he no longer needed taking up space in the garden. The woman who took them from me was delighted and said she could use them all. </p>
<p>UF had decided that we should top up the red rocks, so three more big bags went into the back of the car, ensuring, UF told me, a smoother ride out to buy a new rose! We stopped for quart baskets of local strawberries and cherries on Mountain Road, before taking the long way out to Virgil to the nursery. What a lovely day for a ride in the country! I took a nice photo of UF choosing his last rose for this summer, with the help of the friendly woman who remembered his last two choices. We put another shade of soft pink rose in the car, and a second basket of smaller strawberries in as well, and continued on our way. </p>
<p>Next stop was a short visit to a very busy Main Street in Niagara-on-the-Lake, to buy some jam at Greaves. They have some unusual jams there as well as the traditional strawberry, raspberry, and peach, and UF is now well stocked. </p>
<p>We both wanted to see Becky's and Wayne's new house, so off we went along the beautiful Niagara Parkway, briefly stopping to have a look at "The Pump House", where Amanda is teaching art classes for the summer. What a beautiful setting to be working in! The Pump House is right behind the fort, and along the road are the most beautiful old homes, with the main street not too far away. </p>
<p>Becky and Wayne live almost directly across the street from the MacFarland House, a spot Doug and I loved to visit when we were dating. We had picnics there and sat in the shade of the old trees beside the main house. I was so busy checking out this area that we drove right by the little white house set well back from the road. Luckily, the best place to turn around happened to be a winery (there seem to be hundreds of them in this area now), and we went in for a wee taste test of an early "dessert" wine. UF also tasted a dry white wine, which he bought. </p>
<p>Access to Becky's and Wayne's is not from the Parkway, but from a small side road just before the house. It is one of several homes set in the midst of a vineyard, and what a spot they have! It is costing them less to rent this reasonably small house, with an amazing setting, than it does to rent an apartment in Niagara Falls. They were both busy working in the huge yard when we drove up, and they stopped to give us a tour. They have already painted three rooms, Wayne has trimmed many of the old neglected trees on the property, they have pulled out big overgrown bushes near the door and front windows, planted peonies and a vegetable garden, and have plans for a new stone walkway, with lots still to do. The older couple who own all of the property are so pleased to have a young couple taking care of it for them, and Becky and Wayne are delighted to be that couple! I took some photos, so eventually they will be up on my Ontario-in-the-summer album.</p>
<p>Across the street from them, on the side road, is the well-known Kurtz Orchards, known for their jams, jellies, and various food treats. They used to sell produce as well, but no longer do that. So, feeling a bit peckish, we took advantage of their many samples and ate our way through the building. We had garlic and cheddar dressing on pretzel sticks, many many jams and jellies, a few curds (the best of which was "mango madness"), and some peanuts and honey too. Yum! The car was sitting even lower when we pulled away!</p>
<p>By this time, Uncle Frank realized that he was really hungry. I suggested just heading home for some of our many leftovers, but he would have none of it. We stopped at a little restaurant in Virgil where he and Auntie Rita often ate, called "Lawrenceville". There wasn't a lot in this "specializing in prime rib" spot for me, so I ordered a Western sandwich, with no ham, and with added tomatoes. It was so big that I ate only the omelette with no bread at all, and cancelled the fries that came with it. UF enjoyed his pastrami-on-rye with a bowl of beef barley soup. </p>
<p>Back to the Falls, hoping to get to Lococo's for some corn on the cob before they closed, but we were an hour late. Perhaps we will find some tomorrow, as we both enjoyed it so much. We stopped at the cemetery and watered both gravesites thoroughly, and then drove to Donna's and Sheldon's to leave a brochure from Candy for them. No one was home, but I stopped long enough to take the photos of their back garden I didn't take the last time I was there. Donna has a long row of beautiful roses along a fence and they smelled just amazing; I know, I smelled each and every one of them. </p>
<p>Next stop... Marie and Graham's, to take some photos of their little "doll house" as UF calls their home. Graham has just finished re-siding the top portion and of course their gardens are always in perfect and glorious condition. I had Graham take a couple of photos of Marie and me too, which will no doubt turn out better than than the two I took using the top of the car as a base. UF and Graham had time to talk about all the various plants and garden techniques Graham uses too; years ago he found six old pillars in terrible shape, and now two of them are part of his rebuilt front porch. </p>
<p>Tea time (actually, long past tea time at 6:30) and since Beth wasn't home (we had hoped to stop in there and spray her roses for her), we called Gerry and had our tea on her wee porch, along with Girl Guide cookies. Gerry is on her own this week while Lionel is away fishing, so I may have some time with her tomorrow to take photos in the cemeteries. Now that I have the digital camera I would like to document all the various burial sites for our family; this way they can be online for everyone else when they want the information. </p>
<p>We left at 9 P.M., when it was still miraculously light out, and went home to check out why our little moon lights weren't working. After spending some time at the front (the ones at the back work fine), UF decided the house lights under the eaves were making the lights think that it was still day time. His solution? He has tucked little stones on top of each one, and says he will "untuck" them each morning. </p>
<p>Then followed our now usual evening routine... sleepytime tea for UF, with bowls of fresh strawberries for both of us. The crossword puzzle awaited us, of course, but it was a tougher than usual one, and we finally decided to leave the final five words until tomorrow, when we could look at it with fresh eyes. No doubt one wrong word has thrown us off. Bed before midnight! </p>
<p>Oh, one last thing... </p>
<p>"Served at the seder was sauteed elver and eared seal, sauteed in a spate of sloe sauce, beautifully presented in an antique osier basket."</p>
<p>Yup! We've been doing crossword puzzles almost daily, and after spending much time on one particularly tough corner two nights ago, UF decided a sentence of those words was in order. UF always checks in his online dictionaries after we have finished a puzzle for all the words we have never heard of (osier and elver), or words we are not sure how to pronounce or know the exact meanings of. </p>
<p>Just for those who may not be up on these words either, "elver" is a baby eel, an "eared seal" is a "type of seal", "spate" is a sudden flood/rush/outpouring of something, and "osier" baskets are made from natural twigs and grasses. UF didn't know the term "seder", although I got it instantly; reading novels by Singer helps me a lot with the Jewish terms. We make a very good crossword team, though, as I know many movie actors from this era and he has the older ones covered; he knows sea terms and I know kitchen terms, etc., etc.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/a_movie_visiting_and_happy_bir.html">A Movie, Visiting, and Happy Birthday to the Twins!</a></h2>
								<p>Uncle Frank and I had a movie date today; we left the house at 11:40 A.M. to see "The DaVinci Code" at Niagara Square. It has been playing here for at least three weeks; the theatre was almost empty, and so we settled into the first elevated front row seats and sat back to enjoy it. I had a big bag of popcorn, of course; I deliberately ate a small breakfast so that I could indulge. We both enjoyed the movie very much; we had read the book about the same time, and thought they did a decent job of it, although were glad that we had read the book for all the details that had to be left out.</p>
<p>We were halfway to Beth's at that point, it was warm and muggy, and the thought of sitting on Beth's porch was very appealing. She was sitting "burning the bottoms of her feet", as UF put it, when we arrived, and she claimed she had just that moment sat down. There was a lovely breeze blowing, and no signs of the muggy weather just a few miles down the road. UF had taken the rose spray out for Beth's newly planted two rose bushes, so she did that, and then gave us a tour of the massive stand of blueberry bushes, and the nicely growing vegetable garden. I picked leaves from three lettuces to take home for a salad, and Beth gave me two of their ripest plum tomatoes as well. </p>
<p>We sat in the kitchen and had tea and big bowls of melon, while Beth took a quick shower (she doesn't like to shower if she's alone!). We had been fooling around with our cameras for a while, testing out our "flower" buttons, and taking closeups of hands and watches. UF seems to have the best one for this, so I must read the instruction book and see what I am doing wrong. I tossed the ball to Reena for about fifteen minutes; she just loves to have some attention and I enjoy making her happy. UF had made friends with her earlier, and both he and I took some cute shots of her paying attention to him. </p>
<p>I called Gerry to invite her for dinner; we are in tonight, and eating leftovers, but tasty ones. Home at 5:30, heated up two pastas as I hadn't heard back from Gerry. UF suggested calling her again, and thank goodness I did, as she hadn't left a message accepting our invitation (she hadn't recognized the stranger's voice on his answering machine)! She came over a half hour later bearing four good servings of her wonderful eggplant parmigiana. She and I shared the two dishes. I made a salad using Beth's lettuce, our tomatoes, and a few balls of the fresh mozzarella I bought last week, and the final touch was a nice big serving of asparagus each. UF thoroughly enjoyed his dinner, as did we. They each had the last two slices of pumpkin pie and I had a bowl of strawberries with my tea. </p>
<p>UF had been cutting back the tops of the plants that have finished blooming and had started to weed, so while Gerry and I went through a big box of recipes, he finished up the garden area he had been working on. I kept most of AR's handwritten recipes for the dishes that I knew best, and also came across a couple written in Mom's handwriting, which I also kept. I will share these with my sisters for their albums. </p>
<p>Doug had a very successful day yesterday on his OneBag site, with over 50,000 hits! I showed Gerry how to access it, and also showed her many of the wonderful photos that Susan sent out today of Amelia, Riku, and Mirei. The two older children look so much longer to me and Mirei looks as though her legs are even chunkier than they were when I left... hard to imagine! Liz sent photos too, as did Gail yesterday, so it has been a great two days for seeing all those faces. </p>
<p>UF and I sat with our port, strawberries, and pistachios working on a crossword; it was an easy one tonight. UF had pulled, cleaned, chopped, and put on a pot of rhubarb to cook up; I decided to add a few bags of uncooked rhubarb from the freezer as it was a bit runny, and sadly found a freezer half-filled with unfrozen food in it! </p>
<p>By' had been using the wet-vac to clean up the water spill from last week, and unplugged the freezer. We decided it was just a sign that it was time to get rid of some things that had been there for too long anyway, and to start afresh. Uncle Frank has been busy cleaning it out, after we took everything out and deposited it in the garbage. It's not going to smell like roses in the garage for the next few days! </p>
<p>We also called Glenn, thinking he was celebrating his birthday at the trailer, but learned that he was in terrible pain with his back, and Wendy had brought him home. He sounded just terrible, with a soft low voice and obviously hurting too much to talk at all. Not a good birthday at all for him. </p>
<p>Gail was home and in good spirits but so sad to learn that her twin brother was hurting. She and Tom had had a lovely day out together, and of course she had lots of wonderful gifts to open and a perfect day celebrating her 59th birthday. We chatted on the "conference call" mode of UF's new phone, which was nice as we could both hear her in the kitchen, using just one phone.  </p>
<p>It's almost midnight so I'm going to close off and get to bed. I intended calling Riku and Amelia tonight, but the freezer took our extra time and now it's too late... night night.  </p>
<p>P.S. Ah, good intentions, but UF and I sat looking at all the photos Susan sent out today, and then had to go and check out the Mirei album to see her rolls, "anklets", and "bracelets" too. She was a chunky, smiling girl too, and it was such fun seeing that little face again. Bedtime? After 1 A.M.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/busy_busy_day.html">Busy, Busy Day</a></h2>
								<p>Hot muggy day here today; I could feel the heat and the humidity the moment I woke up this morning, so got right to work. No point in showering since I knew within minutes of doing anything physical I would need another one. I changed the bedding on both beds as soon as UF was out of the shower, we sat and had a leisurly breakfast of cold cereal, etc. while reading the paper, and then the day got really busy. I tidied the laundry room with UF's help, cleaned the bathrooms, did all the ironing and continued on with it as the laundry got finished; we went through UF's closet, checking out shirt sizes, as well as a few pairs of trousers. I planted the newest rose, a beautiful pale pink called "Princess Grace", spread out another three bags of red rocks around the back and sides of the house, made a fruit salad, cooked broccoli for UF to have cold tomorrow, chatted with Marie and Graham for an hour while we had lunch (I had hoped to join them at "The Donut Diner" where they ate), and away went our day with random jobs around the house. </p>
<p>Just before 6 P.M. UF and I dashed out in the car to take a load of shirts, slacks, typewriters, and a decades-old hair dryer to Goodwill. We were so pleased they were still open, and they were delighted with our offerings. </p>
<p>Home for dinner; it was tempting to take UF up on his offer to eat out, but there was food in the fridge I wanted to use up. We were both very hungry after our busy day, so quite enjoyed our whole wheat pasta with "ground round" and fresh tomatoes added to the sauce, a nice big serving each of sauteed spinach with pine nuts, and a half cob of corn each. For dessert we had the freshly picked rhubarb with strawberries added to it we made up last night, and of course Devon custard. What a treat, and we took a little time over tea for a break before starting up again. </p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Bob McLean had stopped in, and was disappointed to learn I was leaving tomorrow. We had hoped to get together with Judy and Bob last week, but somehow the time slipped away. So, the plan was that they would come over this evening for a visit. I expected them to arrive at 9:30.</p>
<p>So at 8 P.M., UF went off to the grocery store on his own. My plan was to vacuum upstairs and downstairs quickly while he was gone, leaving a few minutes to tidy up a bit. However, the doorbell rang at 8:15, and we had company... so, we had a visit in the kitchen, while I chatted and peeled some veggies for a slow cooker side dish for UF tomorrow. </p>
<p>UF went off to Canadian Tire too, so didn't arrive home until 9:15; Judy and Bob stayed on an extra hour, and by that time I was really tired, with no energy at all. We did have our glass of port and strawberries, and did a few crossword lines, but went off to bed before midnight. </p>
<p>Glenn was to have seen a doctor today at 4:30, but no word from him as to how it had all gone; he was still in a lot of pain when I talked with him earlier.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/06/jetlagged_stan_rogers_and_happ.html">Jetlagged, Stan Rogers, and Happy Birthday, Beth!</a></h2>
								<p>At 8:00 A.M. Toronto time, my body decided it was time for me to awaken; I gave up trying to convince it otherwise and got out of bed at 5:30 local time. </p>
<p>There were over 250 emails in my inbox waiting to be answered/ sorted/filed/tossed or answered, so I spent the next two-plus hours working on that project. </p>
<p>Just as I had wrapped myself in a towel after showering, there was a loud knocking on the bathroom door; Riku had come up to say hello on his way to school, while Bryn dropped off the laundry. Akane and Mirei were to be over soon to spend the morning and I had hoped Amelia would be here for a few hours as well; she would have loved the time with the baby. However, Mirei slept for a long time this morning and Amelia and Susan had a slow beginning to their day on Ashbury Street. Riku and Bryn had popped in for a visit while Amelia was still in her PJs, so there were no children here this morning after all.</p>
<p>I called Beth hoping to talk to her on birthday number 55, but there was no answer. I sang "Happy Birthday" to her on the phone, and just prayed that no one would hear it but her. She wrote later saying she had had a wonderful day, despite having to work, with lots of flowers and presents given to her while she was there. Her birthday will be celebrated properly on Sunday. </p>
<p>I put the last load of their clothes in the washer at 11 A.M., so that I could get working on our big basket waiting upstairs, emptied out one big suitcase, and sorted through my mail.</p>
<p>We arrived at the school at 1:05 to pick Riku up from school. He's a big guy there now, so his name is on the "senior" sheet and his cubby near the front of the building. It was lovely to see that happy little boy come running towards me! I read him three new Caillou stories on the way home, and he wanted a little time playing with two new plastic animals before napping. I fell asleep with him for forty minutes(!) ... a rare thing for me, and he napped from 1:50 to 4 P.M. </p>
<p>When he first awoke we sat on his bed, tossing a stuffed animal back and forth between us. Every so often I would pretend that it was knocking me backwards, and he laughed out loud so hard each time I did it. How easily one can make a child laugh! </p>
<p>The sparkly white PlayDoh from the Dollar Store in the Falls was a huge hit, and Riku rolled happily away with the small rolling pin, ending up with three tiny little "ice cream" confections for me, artfully decorated. He gave me a knife and fork but no spoon, telling me it was "too sticky" to eat with my fingers. </p>
<p>The highlight of the day was Riku asking me if I knew the song about "straight dark rows"! I was astounded that he knew this Stan Rogers song, "The Field Behind the Plow"; Doug told me that Bryn plays it on the car stereo while they drive to and from school. He has heard him sing it before but was obviously still amazed at how well he knows it. Doug played it on the computer for us, and Riku sat playing with the PlayDo while singing along to it. To hear that little boy singing "Take the wife back home for Christmas if you can; All summer she hangs on, while you're so tied to the land" was the sweetest thing I have heard for a long time! He was singing quietly along to himself as it played, and with such feeling too. Wow! </p>
<p>We were just heading out the door for some sidewalk chalk time when Bryn arrived, so he chatted with his dad, while we drew Riku's body outline on the sidewalk and then crossed the street to say hello to our old "pal", a lovely older man and his tiny dog. </p>
<p>We were busy playing hide and seek when Riku spotted a little girl climbing into a car, just a few houses down. He ran over to say "hi" to her and her parents and we learned that they will be our neighbours for only two months before moving to the other side of the city; however, they invited us to knock on their door anytime Riku wanted to play, and I know Amelia would enjoy meeting her too. She's four years old and has two dogs, which will be a huge hit with Amelia as well. </p>
<p>I waved goodbye to Riku and Bryn at 6 P.M., came in and took care of a few more emails, and finally headed upstairs to eat our very light dinner of potstickers while watching a movie with Doug. He rubbed my shoulders as I lay across his legs, and I dozed off now and then while watching a sweet old movie (from the 40s), set in the Hebrides during WW2. The day ended with a hot cup of tea, while sitting on the sofa and dozing off. Bedtime at 11:40.</p>
