								<h2>Candy In Town and Mirei Cuts Her First Tooth!</h2>
								<p>The forecast called for rain today, and although it didn't happen, it was muggy and overcast all day today. Uncle Frank is missing his perfect Denver mornings, as well as the dry air and lower temperatures. </p>
<p>We had a late leisurely breakfast this morning, with another poached egg, juice, a dozen grapes, and a half banana each. I read through a couple of days' worth of old papers while Uncle Frank went up to the computer and his phone calls. He had called his neighbour yesterday about getting an appointment for his physiotherapy, and was disappointed to learn that she hadn't been able to do so as yet. She needs copies of his surgical records, so today we ran some errands, first to the bank, and then to the nearby plaza to get the copies he needs for his doctor here and his own records as well.</p>
<p>I wanted some things from the bin store, and UF needs cinnamon for the pumpkin pies he makes when Neal comes home, so in the mid-afternoon we headed out, stopping at the cemetery after the bin store. I pulled up some weeds from around both Auntie Rita's and Mom's & Dad's sites, and from there we drove to Rainbow Gardens to buy some colourful flowers and white stones to tidy them both up after we've had some rain. We drove by our old house on Ash Street; it has been completely renovated and I peeked in as many windows as I could. There is a wooden deck with French doors leading off the kitchen, and it made me feel a little teary to see our old kitchen with a new layout and all new cupboards. The hardwood floors in the living room/dining room area look lovely and there is carpet on the stairs going up to our bedrooms. The selling price is now $149,000, up from the $99,000 being asked before the renovations. Glenn had gone through on an open house last weekend and managed to take lots of photos for us of the interior. UF and I both agreed they should plant some flowers in the front flower bed and tidy up the little around the side and back of the house. Mom kept it tidier than that all the years she lived in it on her own. It's still tough to just drive by... </p>
<p>It started to drizzle lightly on the way home. We need the rain for the gardens, which I am hoping Candy will help me with when she is here. I had dinner on the table very quickly tonight... we both enjoyed the wild salmon in dill sauce, a half each of a baked sweet potato, sauteed spinach, and pine nuts, with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar, carrot sticks, and for dessert with tea, a little later on, I made up two dishes of the stewed rhubarb we picked together last fall, with a small amount of custard. Yum! </p>
<p>Tonight, we settled in the living room for the latter part of the evening, with our port. Uncle Frank has books that he received for Christmas, so he read over some recipes from the slow cooker recipe book Gail and Tom gave him. So many sounded easy and delicious that I had him choose three to try this week... he chose a vegetable side dish, a soup, and a meat dish. More on this as we make them. We also had lots of fun trying hard to work on a New York Times crossword book. Oh my! I think we ended with about fourteen words filled in, with a trip to Doug's online dictionary to confirm the prefix "nux<br />
for "vomica"; I can well imagine one page will do for the entire trip at this rate! </p>
<p>While we were relaxing in the living room the phone rang twice; Donna was calling to see if "the girls" could arrange to get together for a full afternoon and evening visit together. She was suggesting that we go to St. Jacob's, but may have decided on a "spa" day starting with time around the pool at Beth's and ending with a whirlpool bath, ordered-in dinner, and hanging out at Donna's and Shel's in the evening, sans Sheldon. I was expecting to hear from Candy tonight; Glenn was picking her up at 7:30 but the line was busy when she called. </p>
<p>Bryn also called me using the free Skype service available right now.. calling from the computer to a home phone number. It was great to hear from him; Riku talked for a little bit, I could hear Mirei in the background, was thrilled to hear that she has cut her first tooth(!)... I knew this would happen when I was away(!)... and a second not far behind apparently, and the happy news that Akane would not be going to Japan on her own with the two children. It has not been settled whether she will stay on with Mirei after her sister's wedding, but I am looking forward to the full days with Riku and adventures with Amelia if this happens.</p>
<p>We headed off for bed at midnight tonight...</p>
