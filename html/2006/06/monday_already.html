								<h2>Monday Already!</h2>
								<p>In just ten days I will be home; I cannot believe how quickly this time away has gone, and yet it seems forever since I have seen the children in San Francisco. </p>
<p>I woke at 9:10 this morning to find Neal and UF both still sleeping. I took advantage of the time alone to catch up with my blogs and read all my neglected emails. Uncle Frank was up an hour later and showered, giving me another half hour to type madly away. At 11:45 we quickly left the house for breakfast at ... yup, "The Queen's Coach". Neal won't even consider going anywhere else; the waitresses are very friendly, the space is open and not crowded feeling at all, and he likes the scrambled eggs and the cheese omelette.</p>
<p>Today I asked him to order the Italian toast, even though he doesn't eat it, so that I could have doubles. The slices are small and the bread is such a treat that I happily ate four slices with my two eggs. No potatoes today; breakfast is a bargain at $1.50!</p>
<p>We drove to Chippawa right after our late breakfast, to check out a screen door for the back of the house. UF took his time looking it over carefully, and then drove to a second place closer to home. He liked the door there a lot, but was appalled at how highly priced they are. I asked if we could stop at Fairview Cemetery so I could water the plants on Mom's and Dad's stone, as it was hot and dry for the past few days. UF and Neal had been to AR's twice this weekend, so the one stop was all that was necessary. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank was feeling a little drowsy, so we dropped him at the house and drove to Beth's at Neal's request. He really enjoys sitting on her porch and listening to us talk; he doesn't say too much, but seems perfectly happy to be there. Rena tried to keep him interested in tossing her a piece of bark mulch, but like everyone else, Neal soon grew tired of her boundless energy. Rena needs a young puppy around to keep her busy! We were getting ready to leave just as Carol pulled up, and before we said goodbye, Paul arrived home as well. </p>
<p>A storm was brewing as we left at 5 P.M., and even though Neal really wanted to go to "Queen's" again for dinner, he didn't like the idea of dragging his dad out in the now pouring rain. He suggested we could possibly eat at home, and was more than keen to do so when I told him I would make him spaghetti with tomato sauce. UF and I both had leftovers... UF his chicken cacciatore with penne from the other night, along with a fresh cob of corn, I a portion of Chinese food I had picked up on Thursday night, before the trip to Toronto was planned. With some fresh mushrooms and a generous amount of fresh asparagus I was a happy camper. Neal ate every bite of his pasta, and thanked me several times for it. </p>
<p>As soon as I cleaned up the kitchen, I got out the massage pad UF had bought late Friday afternoon. It had been busy enough that evening, and then rushed on Saturday morning before I left, so that it hadn't been unpacked. I was sure that UF would have had it going on the weekend, but he and Neal were busy, and so he finally got to use it for the first time tonight. It must have been very relaxing as I left him sitting against it, and Neal just tiptoeed by to tell me that his dad is sleeping. Yup, he's curled up on his bed sound asleep; I'm not surprised, as he felt tired all afternoon (else he would have joined us at Beth's). He would have liked to have seen the two climbing rose bushes he bought for her on the weekend. </p>
<p>I sat with Neal downstairs in the rec' room; he had CNN on, so I watched a bit of that with him while keeping busy with a crossword puzzle from last Friday. At 9 P.M. I decided to wake UF so that he would sleep tonight, but he was just coming out of his room as I headed up the stairs. Neal said goodnight then, and I made UF a cup of his nighttime tea. We sat downstairs as well, and after a little TV time we finished up the one puzzle together and got started on Saturday's as well. UF does amazingly well at coming up with words, while not having access to the sheet, something I just cannot do. It must be a spatial thing. </p>
<p>Bedtime at 11:30...</p>
