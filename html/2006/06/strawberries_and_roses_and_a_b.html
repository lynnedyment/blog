								<h2>Strawberries and Roses... and a Big Mess!</h2>
								<p>This was an almost perfect day; Candy being here to share it with us after our busy week last week would have made it perfect.<br />
 <br />
Before leaving the city, we stopped at Avondale to pick up three more yogurts for Neal; he had polished off the final three last night, and he will miss lunch at his place in Hamilton. Even though he insisted he would be fine 'til dinner, he finished all three once we got there. </p>
<p>Neal lives in a big and very beautiful former private home in an area of Hamilton that has been designated heritage property. The large home he is in is surrounded by the most beautifully well-kept brick and Tudor homes, all perfectly landscaped, as is his. </p>
<p>Judy, the chief cook and housekeeper, came out to the car as Neal was eating his yogurt, and invited us in to have a tour of the home and to see Neal's room. UF has been here before but had only been on the first floor. Everything is very tidy, organized, and in place. Neal showed us where he sits at the table for six, their TV room, and kitchen (dinner was going to be beef stew; Neal quietly, and with a grin, kept begging to come home with us!)</p>
<p>Neal was concerned about his dad climbing the narrow and winding stairs to his room (the back stairs from the back of the house), but they have good solid hand rails and he was fine. We met all of his housemates but one, who was out for the afternoon. Peter is a tall and  gentle giant of a man, the newest member, having arrived only six months ago. Kathleen, an older woman, has been there for six years. And the friendliest of the bunch (whose name I have forgotten for the moment) was so sweet, throwing her arms around both UF and me when she was introduced, and then taking me into her airy double room, and showing me the photo of her 16-year-old son. He lives up north in Owen Sound and plans to go to University next year. She had lots to say, and whispered how none of them like Judy, the gal in charge.</p>
<p>Three young children live in the house too, on the third floor with their parents, who own the business. The children are 2, 4, and 6 years old, and occasionally come downstairs to visit with the residents. I, of course, took a few group photos of Nea's housemates; they all seem very nice and we met the fifth one coming in. She told me it was just as well she wasn't home for the photo as she was in no mood to be photographed anyway.</p>
<p>The house has lots of character, was built about eighty years ago, and still has many of the original pieces of beautiful furniture in the various rooms, and paintings and prints on the walls. We went downstairs using the much wider front stairwell, with its beautiful wood banister, leading to the front door with leaded glass foyer windows.</p>
<p>Nea's room is small, but not tiny, and very very tidy. UF was very surprised and pleased to see everything in order; Neal immediately set to work putting all his things away before coming out to the hallway to chat with everyone. They were all happy to see Neal home again.</p>
<p>Before leaving, I took some photos of the surrounding neighbourhood houses and the heritage sign, and plan to have a "Neal" album up when I get home. I am just so sorry I didn't get a photo of the three Massard men; I missed my one opportunity last week. UF said there are very few of those.</p>
<p>Neal was sorry to see us leave, and I wished I could have brought him home with us again. He is obviously happy to be free to just wander about at his own speed, eat when he's hungry, get out for some drives, drop in to see Beth, and have breakfast and dinner out. There is no food allowed to be brought into the home by the residents at all, and no access to the fridge either. However, as UF says, he is stable there and treated kindly, which is a much better situation than has been true many times in the past.</p>
<p>UF is after some breakfast or luncheon plates, dishes halfway between bread and butter plates and the larger 10-1/2 inch dinner plates. We had talked about how this is a much better sized plate to eat from when trying to keep the portions Denver diet sized, but they're hard to find. So, we have been talking about visiting some pottery shops in the area; on the way home we spotted a sign on the highway for "Forks Road Pottery" in Grimsby. We had missed the exit, and had to double back to get to it, but what a wonderful place it is! We were lucky enough to run into yet another friendly gal, who walked us through the original railway station, with many lives in between that and the present antique and pottery shop. It is huge, and we strolled very slowly throughout the three big rooms, looking at massive grinding wheels, really old pottery from the mid-90s (not for sale), wonderful old pine furniture, including a fabulous huge blanket box at only $390(!) and so much more. What a bargain the box was; it would cost four times that or more on the west coast, and would easily hold all my extra blankets, duvets, pillows, etc. Does anyone I know have room for it? No. It would be a wonderful piece in a big living room or bedroom though...</p>
<p>I fell in love with one of the patterns of the main potter, one called "the garden". I couldn't resist and bought myself a small plate, and ordered two other pieces as well, which I shall pick up in the fall. UF and the gal chatted a lot about various pieces and we did lots of holding and touching of wonderful old objects; I love Ontario for this reason alone! It makes me long to be back here. I took some photos and on we went, an hour or more later.</p>
<p>On our way to Niagara-on-the-Lake, on Mountain road, we stopped at a fruit stand (how wonderful it is to be here in the early summer and fall!) and bought the most wonderful local strawberries, grown and sold by such a friendly woman. UF had spotted quart baskets for $7 earlier, but these were just $4 and so delicious! We bought two and plan to eat them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for as long as they last.</p>
<p>How Susan would love to be here; there were no cherries to be had, as the few the seller had were gone early this morning... she didn't have enough pickers to collect more. Susan and I could easily spend a few days picking berries and cherries to our heart's content! UF and I must remember to get there early on Friday, as she thinks she will have more by then.</p>
<p>Next stop was at a wonderful nursery in Niagara-on-the-Lake, a spot I had read about in the paper a few days ago. It was in an article on roses, and highlighted this business specializing in hardy and English roses, in particular those called "David Austin" roses, which have been grown for their heavenly scent and large and sumptious blooms... and hardy enough for Ontario winters too. Was this spot worth the drive out there! Once again we had the help of a wonderfully friendly woman, a gal from Switzerland originally; she recognized the name Massard from that country. She and UF had a long discussion about what brought their families to the new country. She and her husband have been running this fruit farm for nine years and every plant is lovingly tended. There isn't a yellow leaf or a wilted rose anywhere in sight and each has an individual little drip system running to keep it well-watered. UF took one look at them and asked me if he had room for two more bushes! The answer really is no, but he stated he would happily toss out two of the ones he has to acquire these. They really were so beautiful, and it was hard to decide which two to choose. Finally we set off, with a gorgeous soft yellow, with new buds about to burst open and one saucer sized bloom, and another soft blush pink, white with pink edges and middle, safely ensconced in the back seat, along with another box of strawberries, these smaller and only $3 a quart!</p>
<p>I had wanted to take Glenn and Wendy out for dinner, in thanks for all the meals and invitations I have had to their home each time I am here. Tonight's the night. The plan was to meet at "Mick 'n Angelo's" soon after 5:30. We were there first, and had a table when Glenn and Wendy arrived. It was such a good evening with them, with lots of talk about family history and searches and stories. UF and I both ordered the angel hair pasta with spinach and mushrooms, with tomato sauce, and now have enough for at least one more meal each in the fridge. However, we are going for dinner with them tomorrow night too; Becky and Wayne will join us, for an early birthday celebration for Glenn. He and Wendy will be at their trailer all weekend. We are really going to have to stay home for the next few days and eat, eat, eat!</p>
<p>Wendy fell in love with our roses and took one of the cards I had for Palantine Nursery. When we opened the car doors to come home it smelled like heaven should smell... strawberries and roses!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we did not come home for the quiet cup of tea and strawberries we had anticipated. The back hose has been dribbling for days it appears, and had soaked through the foundation into the laundry room and downstairs bathroom!</p>
<p>I was out in the garage getting the recycling ready to go out, and UF told me the bad news as he came upstairs with soaking shoes. By' showed up just at the right moment, and was able to get the wet/dry vaccum going, hauling out the wet rugs, which I have dripping on the lawn chairs still, and took an hour to get it all cleaned up. No damage done, just a freshly washed basement floor! They had a fan running up until we went to bed, and it was already dry.</p>
<p>I had taken all of our purchases out of the car, started clearing out the recycling and garbage, swept more of the garage floor, pulled weeds from and swept the front walkway, planted the last of the plants in the front bed, and watered the new plants. Longest day of the year today, so I was out there until almost 9:30, coming in just as it got dark.</p>
<p>Finally, at 9:40, we had our tea and strawberries, finished last night's crossword puzzle (a cinch!), and found another unfinished one in the kitchen drawer. That one was a bit of a challenge in the last corner, and we had our port as we tackled it. Off to bed after midnight again... still no computer time for more than a quick reading of emails... maybe tomorrow... bed after 1 A.M. What a wonderful day!</p>
