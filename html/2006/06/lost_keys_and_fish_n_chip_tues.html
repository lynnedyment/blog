								<h2>Lost Keys... and Fish 'n Chip Tuesday</h2>
								<p>I set off at 9:30 on this gorgeous day to pick Candy up at Beth's. I found them both sitting on the porch; what a picture! Beth took me out to the bush area and led me down a wide winding path that Paul is making for the children. They are going to love it; one day it will be lined with 100 tall white pines he is planting along the way. </p>
<p>Beth and Candy had planted some flowers yesterday, so I had a look at all of those before heading off with Candy to pick up paint at Benjamin Moore's on McLeod Road. We drove by the house on Ash Street, of course, on our way back here. </p>
<p>We set to work on the painting immediately... all the woodwork in UF's office, to set off the lovely pale sage green paint that was done a few months ago. Candy and I both sanded the bathroom ceiling over the tub in prep' for painting as well; UF decided we needed more sand paper, went to get the keys for the car, but they were missing from the usual spot in the kitchen. </p>
<p>That set off a search for hours and hours, with no results at all. It is very frustrating as I had them last, as far as I know, and only walked into the kitchen and onto the bedroom before getting busy with the bathroom work. All of us took turns searching the car, the garage, our purses, under the bed and car, on shelves, in the garbage containers in the house, in "headbump", in pockets, etc. Nada. </p>
<p>Candy and I prepped and painted the woodwork off and on, stopping for a light lunch with UF, and tea, mid-afternoon. Of course, in between every stop and with each step we took, we were looking for them. </p>
<p>Gerry picked us up at 6 P.M. for dinner at her house; we could have eaten here more easily, since she had to drive us in both directions, but I had a horrible headache and wanted away from the scene of the crime. We spent three hours on Sheldon Street, eating our delicious fish and chips, enjoying every bite of the lemon meringue pie Gerry had made, and drinking tea. Lionel was with us for less than an hour but we all worked on the Niagara Falls review crossword, making a very good and efficient team, and then worked a smaller and easier one before leaving.</p>
<p>Home before 10 P.M., searched again, had our first glasses of port in a few days (Candy abstained), she and I played cards while UF was on the computer, and then it was bedtime... at midnight. Perhaps I will dream about the whereabouts of the keys!</p>
<p>This just in from Bryn:</p>
<p>Mirei is officially a flipper! She did her first unassisted flip at the studio on Tuesday morning. She can now do them at whim and very quickly too!</p>
<p>She has also discovered that she can hammer her various toys against a nearby wall to make a noise.</p>
