								<h2>Robin's Egg Blue and an Early Birthday Celebration</h2>
								<p>I woke at 9:15 this morning! Good thing as I had read until after 2 A.M. although my guess is that I was dozing off and on for an hour before turning out the light. Uncle Frank slept until 11:30, so I had lots of computer time before showering, making the beds, and getting our brunch on the table. </p>
<p>It was 12:30 when we sat down to eat; UF weighed in at 159 this morning so asked for a good hearty breakfast. I made up lovely big fruit plates, with half a banana each, half a mango, a nice clump of red grapes, and a generous number of strawberries. Yum! UF also had scrambled eggs, turkey bacon, sauteed fresh tomatoes, his juice, and green tea. I had one scrambled egg, one slice of toast, and a few spoonfuls of tomatoes.</p>
<p>UF went off on his own after some time in the computer room in the early afternoon. John was called to come over for some repair and painting on two ceilings; Stephanie was with him, and helped with the ladder while he trimmed the pear tree and dragged two big lounge chairs out of the headbump space. It was hot and humid today and we had turned the air on; working outside was not an option for me. Instead, I did a little weeding right after brunch, then came in and changed the sheets on Nea's bed, vacuumed and cleaned his room thoroughly, ran the vacuum through the hallway, did a load of laundry, and called Marie and Beth to catch up with them.</p>
<p>UF was gone for over two hours, getting the car washed and lubricated, and trying, unsuccessfully, to get a spare key made at a locksmith. He got home just twenty minutes before we were to meet Glenn and Wendy, Becky, her mother-in-law Alice, Wendy's mom, Stephanie, her brother Jonathon, and boyfriend John for dinner at "Lee's" Chinese restaurant at Stamford Plaza. It was an early birthday celebration for Glenn, who will be at the trailer on his birthday Sunday.</p>
<p>Dinner was delicious. There must have been ten different dishes and the owner kindly cooked up a perfect dish with sauteed tofu and lots of crisp and varied vegetables. I loved every bite of it and ate it all; I did have to share a few pieces of tofu with a few people who wanted to try it. Not one of them liked it much; they found it too chewy.</p>
<p>Glenn's main gift was in the trunk of his car for him, a wooden bench that turns into a picnic table to be used up at the trailer. They love to eat in the back, overlooking the water, and have only had a temporary table up to this point. Becky went home right away, John and Steph' disappeared, but the rest of us went back to Glenn's and Wendy's for tea and some time to talk to each other. There were so many for dinner and UF and I were at the far end of the table.</p>
<p>Home by 9:15; UF is reading the paper, and I will join him now for strawberries and some port while we do the crossword puzzle. I want to get to bed early tonight, as I would really like to plant the two rose bushes in the morning before it gets too hot. We have a day out planned, which means I have no idea how I am going to accomplish all the things on my mental list!</p>
<p>... oh, the "robin's egg blue" part. While pulling a few weeds in the front garden this morning, I found the most beautiful tiny robin's egg; only half of it was there but oh my, what a colour!</p>
