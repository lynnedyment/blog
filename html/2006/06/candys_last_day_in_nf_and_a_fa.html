								<h2>Candy's Last Day In NF, and a Family Gathering</h2>
								<p>I dreamt about finding the car keys last night but, alas, it was only a dream. Throughout the entire day, with every job we did, we all had our eyes open for the keys, to no avail. </p>
<p>We had breakfast with Uncle Frank before starting the second coat on the office trim. Candy says she is going to miss our long chats over our meals; we never rush through them, but relax and visit before getting on with our to-do lists. </p>
<p>However, we had lots on the lists today, so soon Candy and I were upstairs putting the second coat on the trim in UF's office. Candy dabbed a little green paint on the nail holes she had filled yesterday, and then we wiped down his desk, I vacuumed thoroughly, and we rehung the freshly washed curtains and toppers. His office looks terrific!</p>
<p>We also looked for a small sander so we could do the bathroom ceiling, but I found it too late in the day to do any of it. We had already hung the freshly washed curtains in there by the time we found it. Candy was so thankful, as it wasn't a job she wanted to do anyway; it may well turn out to be a much bigger job than she could have finished to her satisfaction in one day. </p>
<p>Candy and I both had to shower before going out to Ian's and Lisa's, so that job has been delayed. I might tackle it next week after Neal has returned home; he arrives tomorrow evening. </p>
<p>We put off lunch until after 1 P.M., at which point Gerry and Lionel arrived. They did a big search for the keys too, inside and out, but while they were here the phones were acting up. Two had dial tones, two didn't, and only the phone in the rec' room would ring. Lionel traced the wiring, and finally took the phone from the rec' room and put it in the kitchen. The problem seems to be that phone, but strange things are happening around here!  :)</p>
<p>At UF's request, I called his dealership to see about getting a new key. The news was not good; we would have to have the car towed there for them to program a new key. Then I called CAA, who came quickly enough, but with the bad news that the car might suffer some damage while they towed it out backwards from the garage. The tires would be locked, would burn rubber for certain, and UF was concerned there would be more damage than that. </p>
<p>Finally, late in the day, UF called a locksmith, who told him if he could sweet talk the dealership into giving him the code for the car, he could cut a key for him. So, UF did just that... called the owner of the dealership, an old high school friend's of Neal's, who promised to send someone over in the morning to program and cut a new key. What a relief! </p>
<p>Candy had planned to cook lamb chops for their dinner tonight, so Gerry had kindly driven her out to pick those up, I finished up the vacuuming of UF's bedroom and Nea's room, tidied up the painting tools, and after Gerry and Lionel left, went out to the garage to sweep and clear out all the recycling bins and garden debris we had collected over the past week. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Candy was busy (thermally) insulating all the wall switch plates in the house, managing to finish them all but the rec' room and three double sets. It's a slow tedious job, but she was very efficient at it. UF is just amazed with her "manly" skills and told her so many times. It is so wonderful having her here with us; we hate to let her go but will do so tomorrow morning. </p>
<p>While Candy cooked the lamb, I took a lovely hot shower. I was pretty tense with the key situation, and the new showerhead has a massage unit on it. Ahhhh... 'twas lovely! </p>
<p>I cooked new red potatoes and asparagus to go with our dinner, and prepared three tomato and boccoccini salads with fresh basil. We had to rush dinner a bit for the first time, as Gerry and Lionel were picking us up for an evening with Lisa and Ian. Not having a car really puts a dent in our independence! </p>
<p>Ian managed to get home early from work tonight, so arrived to greet us, Glenn, and Wendy, at about 8:30. That boy is such a delight; he walked in the door with his big grin, making us all feel welcome, as does Lisa. She had a table beautifully set up with hot and cold snacks for us, lots of drinks to choose from and "read" our cards too... all but UF's tonight. </p>
<p>Lionel, Glenn, and UF were casually watching the game between the Edmonton Oilers and the Carolina Hurricanes, but were still chatting and being social while it was on; Edmonton won 4-3 after going into overtime. </p>
<p>Home after a series of group photos, of all but Glenn and Wendy who had left earlier. I got photos of the two of them though, and just before leaving Ian posed for us in his Commissioner's uniform and two different hats, one of which was a sombrero that Lisa brought him home from Spain. </p>
<p>Lisa, by the way, is as tanned as can be, mostly a result of sitting in a fishing boat all last week, her first fishing experience and one she enjoyed very much. She and Ian had taken a week off to go to a cottage and had a grand time. Each time I am in her company, I am so grateful that my brother has this wonderful partner in his life... and we get to share her too! </p>
<p>Bed much too late; UF had his tea and Candy got ready for bed, and then at 1 A.M. suggested we at least start the crossword puzzle so she could help out a bit. We went to bed a half hour later, chatted until almost 2 o'clock, with the alarm set for 5 A.M.!</p>
