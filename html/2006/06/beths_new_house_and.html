								<h2>Beth's New House and...</h2>
								<p>I was at the computer this morning, when Candy called from Glenn's. She was up bright and early and I quickly dressed and went to pick her up to spend some time here with Uncle Frank and me. She looks terrific and was her bright and happy-as-usual self. We sat chatting in the living room until Uncle Frank woke at 11:15 A.M. I had asked him last night not to set his alarm, but he had, for 8:30, and to his credit had decided to crawl back into bed for a bit. I was so pleased that he did, as we should all sleep as much as we need to. Alarms and being wakened are two of my pet peeves.  </p>
<p>Candy made herself a tomato sandwich, and then had tea with Uncle Frank and me over a late breakfast for us... very late, as it was 1:15 when we finished! Uncle Frank had scrambled egg, one slice of turkey bacon, and a slice of toast; he asked for the one slice of bacon but thinks it may have been the only time in his life he had just one. Oh yes, Virginia has been a good teacher for both of us. </p>
<p>We all drove over to Beth's around 3 P.M. The house is just gorgeous, inside and out, with big airy rooms, fourteen acres of fruit trees, lawns and woods, a large in-ground pool, and a just-planted vegetable garden. We walked around some of the property and sat outside for a while, but the mosquitos drove us into the house. It was humid and threatening to rain and they were out in full force. </p>
<p>About 5 P.M. we headed back to Uncle Frank's house; we had a little time here before driving the few miles to Glenn's and Wendy's for dinner. Becky was there as well, looking wonderfully healthy. She told us she had hit the 100 pound weight loss mark; she's doing it on her own and has obviously worked hard at it. </p>
<p>For dinner there was prime rib, with grilled salmon for Wendy and me, mashed potatoes, a big green salad, brussel sprouts, a delicious sauteed spinach and mushroom dish, whole wheat dinner rolls, with Key lime pie or Mississippi mud pie for dessert. It was a great spread and we all sat drinking tea and catching up on our news after dinner. </p>
<p>It was Stephanie's graduation formal tonight; we were sorry not to have seen her in her dress, but look forward to seeing the photos. I snapped some pictures of everyone, although Becky wouldn't let me take one of her; later on she and Glenn dumped water on each other and Beth managed to snap a couple. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank was tired and dozing off a bit so we left to come home about 9:30. We sat and had our port in the kitchen tonight, most unusual for us, but intended getting to bed a little earlier. I checked my email, and found I had a message from Amelia! She wrote me lots of numbers, letters and capital letters... very interesting. I wrote back right away and hope this is the beginning of a lifelong correspondence.  </p>
<p>Uncle Frank finally had his cogeco account working and I left him writing some emails at 11:15. I headed for bed and my book, thinking I would spend a little more time on the computer after Uncle Frank finished off, but turned off my light at midnight instead. I heard UF heading for bed minutes later too...</p>
