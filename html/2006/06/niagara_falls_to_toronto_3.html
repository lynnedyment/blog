								<h2>Niagara Falls to Toronto</h2>
								<p>I was awake at 8:15 this morning, showered quickly, made both beds, and quickly sorted through my various belongings to pack up a full bag to take to (and leave in) Toronto. This will save me having to take two big bags on the bus when I leave here in ten days. To my surprise, UF and Neal were sitting at the table, having finished up scrambled eggs, prepared by UF, for their breakfast! He hadn't found the bread in the fridge so it had been a very lean breakfast for UF, especially today. There were eggs waiting for me in the oven too. UF was keen to get out to Niagara Square, as I had promised him last night we would go out for the phone before I left for Toronto today. </p>
<p>Neal came with us for the drive, and UF chose his first set of cordless phones, with two units for the kitchen and his bedroom. As soon as they are hooked up he will have a new answering machine as well, as part of the kitchen phone. We stopped for a few groceries on our way to the bus terminal; Neal drinks lots of milk and eats three yogurts at a time, so the dozen we bought on Thursday were almost gone this morning. </p>
<p>They dropped me off at 11:15, leaving me time to cross over to the Chinese restaurant across the street and get an order of veggie-stuffed tofu-skin rolls, and a Coke, for my lunch. The bus left at noon, and I had two seats to myself to spread out, read, and do a few crosswords, while enjoying the views from the air-conditioned bus. </p>
<p>Kelly and Caillie picked me up after my arrival at 2 o'clock. Caillie was her usual bright and perky self, and chatted all the way home. It was great to be back and to see all the children; they were all home and looking great. Bryant had had a sleepover last night, as part of his birthday event, and there were several boys sitting around the table on the deck, still eating and talking. The party was to have ended at 11 A.M., after a late sleep-in and a huge breakfast prepared by Gregg, but there they still were at 2:30! Gregg drove them home shortly after this.</p>
<p>Caillie and I played a word game, and then I went through the fabulous album Kelly had made Bryant for his birthday. Next up was her completed album of their trip to the Grand Canyon for Kelly's fortieth birthday last year. What a wonderful album it is, with not only lots of great photos of them all, but accompanied by lots of detail about their trip down and back up from that amazing canyon. This took a long time to read, and Caillie told me how nice it was that I read it; interesting comment, and perhaps it will encourage her to do lots of writing too. </p>
<p>Bryn went off to Sean's birthday party at 4 P.M. and Kelly, Gregg, Bryant, Caillie, and I walked around the corner to Clare's 30th birthday party; she is a friend and a member of Kelly's CM team. Myk' was grounded last night, with phone and computer privileges taken away for some time, so she stayed home, walked the dogs, and kept herself busy in her room. Meanwhile, the rest of us were sitting on a newly-built deck, filled with many of Clare's friends, and all of their gorgeous children, almost all of them two-year-olds. </p>
<p>The food was just fantastic, with some great cheeses, assorted dips and veggies, and later the best corn salad I have tasted. Clare has promised to send the recipe on to Kelly, as she just discovered it herself last week at a party. Yum! Dessert was spectacular, with a chocolate fountain, and a massive plate of fresh fruit. Bryn and I agreed that the oranges and chocolates were a great combination but the fresh strawberries were wonderful too.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the evening, a two-week-old baby girl arrived and Bryn was in his glory, holding her for about twenty minutes, inspecting her toes and hands, and stroking her cheeks and head. <br />
  <br />
We all left at 9:30, as tomorrow will see us out the door as close as we can make it to 8:30 A.M. The children went to bed, I checked my emails, and after Gregg went to bed at 11, Kelly and I stayed up too late... until 1 A.M., chatting. We have so little time alone but tomorrow morning will come too soon for both of us. Kelly is fighting off a sore throat; she has lots on her plate as usual!</p>
