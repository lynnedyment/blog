								<h2>A Gardening Day and an Evening Out</h2>
								<p>Candy and I were out in the garden this morning before UF awakened. It was perfect for it. We weeded, lay red stone on the flower beds, mulched a couple of others, and Candy planted a few more flowers. Uncle Frank and Auntie Rita always decorated the front of their home so beautifully, and for the first time since Auntie Rita's death, there is a tiny wicker tricycle by the front door, with a pot of flowers on the seat, and a tiny child-size bench. Later in the day a little boy from across the street was chatting with us, and I thought how AR would have been his best friend on the block if she were here with us still. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank had a doctor's appointment at 1 P.M., so at noon I came in quickly, made lunch for us, tidied up and managed to get there on time. Candy stayed home to finish up some outside jobs. All went well with the doctor; UF really just wanted to fill him in on the results of his surgery, but he had very good results from his blood work... cholesterol and blood pressure both low. UF says he is in great shape, from the belly button up!</p>
<p>We had tea and cookies and went immediately outside to get back to work in the gardens. Uncle Frank had bought some "pagoda" lamps, which use solar energy to light up the pathway at night, and he placed those while Candy planted geraniums and I planted the rest of the flowers under the windows, and white impatiens in the front bed. We were busy right up until 6 P.M. when we had to stop and get ready for dinner out with Gerry and Lionel. We weren't really ready to stop, but it was a good thing we had to, as we were all tuckered out from the fresh air. We accomplished so much; the front yard looks amazing! I took lots of photos and can't wait to see them online. </p>
<p>We drove out to the Lane for dinner at Mick 'n Angelo's, a very popular and busy spot. We had to wait forty minutes to be seated but it was worth it; the food is plentiful and delicious, and enough for generous helpings to take home too. Lionel and I both had angel hair pasta with mushrooms and spinach and asked for tomato sauce with it; Candy had it with the original garlic and olive oil. Gerry had a delicious looking eggplant parmigiana, and UF enjoyed every bite of the half of his linguine carbonara. Soup or salad came with the meals, again with very generous portions, and hot crusty bread. Yum! It was loud but we enjoyed it all anyway. </p>
<p>Gerry and Lionel came back for tea and there was rhubarb and custard for those who wanted it. We also worked together to finish off last night's crossword puzzle; Lionel is very good at them, and UF always manages to get the tougher ones, while Candy and I do our best. Gerry came up with one tough one that had us stumped, and that led to the finishing off of the last problematic corner. </p>
<p>They left for home about 10:30, so after checking emails and puttering about for a bit, the three of us sat down to do tonight's puzzle, a much easier and shorter one. We were feeling pretty smug, thought we would get to bed earlier, and somehow that didn't happen... computer time, checking out some photos online, chatting, etc., etc. I went to bed at 1:15, Candy was already turned over to sleep, having finished her book the night before, and Uncle Frank was at the computer when I said goodnight. I read until 1:45. Insane. </p>
<p>Dad died nineteen years ago today; he was on our minds today, and Candy and I talked about him as we planted the flowers. It is hard to imagine that so much time has passed.</p>
