								<h2>A Day with No Children...</h2>
								<p>... is truly like a day with no sunshine! This was the first time since I arrived home from Toronto, I believe, at the end of September, that I have not laid eyes for more than a few minutes on one of the three children here in the city. Bryn stopped in at 8:40 with their laundry, which meant I did have two minutes of sunshine as Riku was with him. He noticed a picture of Santa on the back of a Reader's Digest, asked if they were elves in the photo near the sleigh, and was obviously taken with the scene. I ripped off the back cover for him, and he studied it intently on the way to school Bryn said... just mesmerized by it. This is going to be such an exciting Christmas for him. </p>
<p>Bryn told me later in the day that he had been playing Stan Rogers as they often do on that trip to school. Following is the exchange that took place between them. Bryn said "He has a beautiful voice." Riku replied "But he died", to which Bryn said: "That's right... he didn't get to be an old man." Riku's response: "I will get to be an old man if you take care of me."</p>
<p>Ah, if only that were true! How very touching that Riku believes this... </p>
<p>Riku woke Bryn up at 6 A.M. today singing "Here Comes Santa Claus"! Bryn did manage to settle him back in for a little extra sleep though.</p>
<p>So, even though my day was childless and the house seemed far too quiet and lonely, I did get lots accomplished today. After wrapping the last of four boxes to mail to Toronto, I stopped to pick up some crochet hooks from a Potrero Hill gal from the Freecycle group. I know I am missing a few from my set, so these will come in very handy one day. On to the post office where there was a surprisingly short line; I bought lots of stamps for Christmas cards and we must get those out within the week. </p>
<p>Home for breakfast, a nice big one as Uncle Frank would say... egg, two slices of sourdough toast, two slices of "bacon", and a big mug of hot chocolate made with my now favourite "drinking chocolate" which Doug bought for me. Then it was time to get started on my day... laundry, and the big job of sorting through three large containers of various baby clothing... a stack for Mirei from Amelia, a stack from Riku for the new baby boy expected at the Ellis/Doering household in a few weeks, and a stack of clothing that may or may not suit one of the two little ones at some point in the future. It took a lot longer than I thought it would but I did get three drawers in the little downstairs bedroom neatly packed with some of the clothes that will fit Riku and Mirei now, with spares for them and Amelia too... T-shirts, warm sweaters, etc. </p>
<p>I chatted with Gail again today; she is having her colonoscopy tomorrow, finally! We hope to see what is going on with her pancreas, as she has been in pain for well over a month now. </p>
<p>Later tonight I phoned and chatted  for a long time with Uncle Frank. It was nice to have the extra free time to do this as it has been too long since we caught up in real time, and not via email. Neal called this morning as well, so it was a very productive phone day! </p>
<p>I was sort of expecting to hear from Akane today, to meet her at the playground with the children. She took Mirei with her to school today, wearing a front baby carrier I would think, so perhaps Mirei had slept in the morning and was set for an adventure on the bus and streetcars with her Mom. Riku was starting his first group piano lesson at 1:15 for I think a half hour. Bryn said later that he enjoyed it and  would go back. Good! We will all be so pleased if he plays the piano as his cousins do. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped in on his way home from work for a moment; I was busy on the phone chatting with a Freecycle member, from whom I had just acquired two free tickets and a free parking spot at the Cow Palace for the "Dickens' Christmas Fair" tickets. Doug and I took Riku to this event two years ago; he chose his first Christmas decoration there, although he was too young to appreciate the marvelous costumes and various British accents everyone working there puts on. We had talked about going but tickets are $20 each plus the charge for parking so this was a great find! I was the first to respond and the fellow who was giving them away was very pleasant and chatty. We will pick them up tomorrow and can go any weekend between now and Christmas. </p>
<p>The evening flew by; I called Toronto to talk with Bryn and Mykayla, both of whom I had missed talking to last weekend. What busy lives they all now lead! Caillie answered the phone and she just made me laugh so much. The first thing she did was tell me that the letter I had told her I had mailed to her had not arrived; it should have, but she realized that she hadn't checked the mail today. So, she put me on "hold"... just pretending, as she can't do that from home, and hummed along some elevator-type mindless music while checking the mailbox! When she had gone though it all she told me it hadn't arrived but she would check the "lost" mail section and see if she could find it. It should be there tomorrow for sure. I congratulated her on her very good report card (solid Bs with some As), and then she passed the phone to Bryn. He got seven As on his report card and is working on his two Bs to bring them up as well. He is enjoying middle school very much, and obviously thriving and enjoying it all. Myk' had been playing the piano in the background; she had forgotten her clarinet and so was practicing on the piano instead. She plays so well and it was a pleasure to hear her; she had made the decision to quit piano when I was there in the fall, much to all our regrets... she plays so well! </p>
<p>After my call, I made some tea and actually sat down and went through a few magazines, cleared the folk art chickens from the living room to make room for the Christmas decorations I pulled out from the cedar chest yesterday, and cleared away bits and pieces from here and there. Playing Christmas music all day helped get me in the spirit and I can't wait to get the house feeling like the season has arrived. </p>
<p>Doug called briefly to say that his flight from Kansas to Denver had been delayed due to winter weather, and so he was being flown to Washington/Dulles(!), to connect with a flight to San Francisco! Instead of arriving at 10:15 he was due in at 12:37.</p>
<p>In the end, Doug arrived at 12:05, and we were in bed by 12:45.</p>
