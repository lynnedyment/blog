								<h2>"This is Cuddlin'..."</h2>
								<p>Too late to bed last night but I woke on my own at 7:45 and quickly got ready to leave the house for my 9 A.M. dermatologist appointment downtown. Doug drove me and waited for the forty-five minutes it took me to get in to see the doctor. Then we were on our way to pick up the free tickets to the Dickens' Christmas Fair at the Cow Palace over the next two weekends. The tickets and parking pass are worth $48 but cost us nothing, thanks to Bob via Freecycle. We had chatted on the phone for a few minutes last night, so it was lovely to meet him as he gave me the tickets. </p>
<p>We were close to Stonestown Mall; neither Doug nor I had been there for well over a year. We wanted to check out the Santa there for a visit with Riku and Amelia, but Doug doesn't like his fake smile so we will see what the downtown Macy's Santa is like. It was really lovely to just wander about the mall, though, admiring the Christmas decorations and listening to the Christmas music. I found clothes for all three children there, and we enjoyed our shared lunches at the Boudin sourdough bakery... broccoli cheese soup in a bread bowl, and a tuna sandwich on a sourdough baguette. Yum! </p>
<p>I drove over at 2 o'clock to pick up Mirei; she had just awakened from a good nap and was her usual bubbly happy self. She ate a big lunch of cereal and veggie stew, plus strained fruit and water, plus some bits of grapes as well. We played our usual game of "hats"; I put something... a plastic cup or bowl on my head, she admires it, I tip my head and it falls off, and then she tries to put it on her head. It's adorable. Or, if it stays on her head, when I have placed it there, she very carefully reaches up to take it off. We are still learning "ears" and she is just starting to point them out on various stuffed animals. And vocal! Oh yes! I couldn't believe how much noise she was making today, just keeping herself amused. </p>
<p>She stood by the coffee table in the living room, looking at books for at least twenty minutes(!) and staying busy, with no intervention at all from us. Riku would do the same thing at that age, and, in fact, still does. After dinner tonight, while I was cleaning up, he was sitting on the sofa, quietly looking through a Spanish language picture book. </p>
<p>And, despite falling from the first stair, Mirei was immediately back up at them, with me behind her, and got to the third stair before we had to leave. She doesn't give up easily, being quite tenacious; her mom has noticed this same trait. </p>
<p>Each day she gets steadier and steadier on her feet and more sure of herself, pulling up with just one hand. She is always quick to flirt with Doug. He noticed yesterday that she seems to know she can't just constantly go to him, so will approach him, sit quietly and wait until he moves his chair on wheels, and then give him the big smile she has been saving for him. He spends a lot of time walking her around the house pointing out her favourite things on the walls. </p>
<p>We didn't get to the playground until 4:35; we drove over because we were busy somehow right up until we left the house. Riku's first words when we got there were "Why you are so long getting here?" He played for a bit on the dome, but didn't want to run and kick the ball; he just wanted to come to my house, so Mirei didn't get to sit in the sandbox today, which she enjoys. They walked home and Riku and I drove; Doug was off to T'ai Chi at 5:30.</p>
<p>Riku quite amazes me in so many ways. Without being reminded or asked, the minute he takes off his coat and shoes he goes right into the bathroom, pulls up the stool, and washes his hands very well with soap and water. </p>
<p>Riku asked to look at his Easter basket of goodies. Last week he threw out all the chocolate he hadn't eaten, and he keeps his promise not to eat any candy until after dinner. He just enjoys lining up the candy, asking what various items are and offering to give our favourites to us. He knows about "rockets" and left out a package for Doug to eat after his dinner and I got a piece of red licorice as my treat. I don't know too many children who could or would just sit with candy right beside him and not even attempt to eat it until it was the time decided upon. He ate a great dinner too; he asked for mac' and cheese, ate a large portion of that along with chopped fresh tomatoes, two slices of "bacon", and a large number of steamed carrot sticks, as well as a bowl of grapes and vanilla soy milk. Then he ate the tiny orange candy he had chosen, after being told he couldn't have the chocolate Tootsie roll this late in the day. </p>
<p>Oh, he wanted to know tonight where the North Pole was and was happily singing Christmas songs throughout the afternoon and evening. He hums away to himself too; what a sweet boy he is! He also commented that Santa had a big tummy and he wondered if Mrs. Santa did too. </p>
<p>He was tired, and after Bryn had dropped in to say goodnight, I got him ready for bed. We read "The Lost Teddy Bear" from my Everyday Storybook, and he was more than ready to sleep. I walked out at 7:30 P.M. with Riku snoring lightly. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a really boring, predictable rental movie; we hadn't a clue that it was from a Christian site but once it got started it was obvious. I thankfully fell asleep as Doug was rubbing my back so missed most of it. Whew! Doug said it was the worst movie we have ever rented from Netflix! </p>
<p>Bryn was on IM: here is his message about their evening with Mirei<br />
"It was a DELIGHT to have her alone at dinner. Tonight she grabbed a finger on each of my hands (0% help from me) and walked six or seven steps; she just <strong>went</strong> too, as soon as she was in position." I had commented that she was now taking more reasonable sized steps... and Bryn replied "no giant steps... i will miss them!" and went on to say: "she made me gut laugh tonight... first time in AGES. She was taking a sip of water (via straw) then started blowing bubbles, we chuckled... she took the straw out, waited a minute... straw back in... she looked right at me and just blew furious bubbles right away. We howled... she was really watching us react. It is really nice to have a "private" dinner with her once a week... extended 1+ hours in the kitchen with no interruption." He finished up with a new observation about tucking Mirei in "last night was interesting... i was holding her as i always do... after five minutes, she was still awake but wiggling... i realized after a bit that she WANTED to be put in the crib... before she was asleep." She is learning to be independent I guess! </p>
<p>Gail had five biopsies done today during her colonoscopy; she now has two weeks to wait for the results, but is still in pain, and still in the dark about what is going on with her. Not a good time for all of this to be going on although the good news is that her amylase count is up, so it isn't her pancreas causing the problems she is having... but what is?  </p>
<p>...as for my blog title... Riku and I were snuggling in bed after his story tonight and he mumbled something to me. I didn't quite catch it and said "Pardon?" to which he replied, snuggling in even closer to me... "This is cuddlin'" Yes, it is and very nice too! </p>
<p>Bed at 11:30.</p>
