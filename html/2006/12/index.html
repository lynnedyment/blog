								<h2><a href="/2006/12/mirei_lunches_at_greens.html">Mirei Lunches at Green's</a></h2>
								<p>Susan phoned this morning to see if I would like to join her and Kevin at <em>Green's</em>, the wonderful vegetarian restaurant located on the waterfront at Fort Mason, with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. I haven't been for a couple of years and eagerly accepted the invitation. Today was to have been my full day with Mirei, but she nodded off for her morning nap before Akane got her over to me. Of course my morning flew by, filled with all the bits and pieces of random chores, a long chat with Neal on the phone, and then it was time to pick up a well rested Mirei at 11:50. </p>
<p>Our dining companions were old friends of Susan's, who first befriended one of their sons at art school in Halifax. She has kept in touch with them over the years and they manage to get together once in a rare while. Ike and Diana are the parents, and their friend Irene is traveling with them from their homes in Alberta. They are just the loveliest of people: world travelers, very interested in art, and so very warm and friendly. </p>
<p>Of course they all thought Mirei was such a sweet girl; she sat in a high chair ever so nicely for most of our two hour lunch, although she also had Susan and Kevin holding her in between courses. On the way out of the restaurant, the hostess made it a point to comment on how well behaved she was. </p>
<p>We all started the meal with a wonderful kabocha squash soup; Mirei had some too, along with crumbled nori, which I had taken along. She daintily ate small pieces of Acme whole wheat bread; what good taste she has already! I had my very favourite vegetable and tofu brochette with a green salad, and two wonderful desserts were ordered for all of us to share. Green's makes its own ice cream and today's was a fresh mint ice cream, sandwiched between meringues plus a fabulous pumpkin brulee with sweetened cranberries. We were treated to the meal by Ike and Diana, even though we protested in vain. It was such a treat to be at Green's again and especially with such good and interesting company. </p>
<p>Mirei had napped for an hour and a half at home, dozed off on the half hour it took me to get to Green's... traffic was terrible and I took a much longer route than was ideal... and then she napped on the way home for about twenty minutes. Not good. I fed her, and hoped she would drift off but soon realized she needed to have time to explore... too much sitting for her so far! </p>
<p>Riku and Akane were home from school early; Riku came in bearing a birthday gift from the school... they hold a birthday party each month for those children born that month, and the gift was a big scrapbook for their school years. There was a gift for Mirei to open as well, which she did on her own!, and it was a lovely soft pink hand-knitted scarf that Susan's mother made for her. It was a thank you to me for having taken care of Amelia while Susan and Kevin were away two weeks ago. It is really lovely with strands of pastel wool knitted through the ends of the scarf. </p>
<p>Susan had loaned me their copy of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"; Doug had ordered a set of three Christmas DVDs this morning, but I thought watching one today would be a treat for Riku. Akane and I had our tea upstairs, Riku had his snack from school, and a plate of strawberries and grapes while we watched the movie. He quite enjoyed it, although he didn't want to hear so much singing (it's Burl Ives singing and narrating), as he wanted to know what was going to happen with the snow monster wandering about in the country! </p>
<p>Mirei was very happy sorting through my bedside drawers and pressing the ringer on the phone to locate it! She was mighty pleased with the results but Grandpa less so. Akane was heading for home just before 5 P.M. to prepare dinner so I suggested that she leave the children here. </p>
<p>Bryn showed up nice and early at the end of this work week, and off he went home with Riku, as I thought it might work out for Mirei to have her (late) afternoon nap here. However, she slept for only a half hour and then wakened crying and inconsolable until I gave up and dressed her. I think she might be teething, or perhaps she was thrown off with the twenty minute nap, so after a little more crawling around, Doug and I walked her home. I knew if we put her in her stroller she would be asleep in minutes so Doug carried her home in the dark. What a treat for her: he stopped to show her neon lights and the cars going in both directions on the highway below the overpass, touch leaves, and look in brightly lit store windows. </p>
<p>Susan called to say that Amelia has a fever again and had a not so wonderful afternoon at school today; it was such a shame as she was game to go this morning and was back to just not feeling well at 3 P.M. I'm so glad it's the weekend and she will have two days to recover from whatever is going on with her. We've had our fair share of fevers in the family this week! </p>
<p>Doug and I had a light dinner upstairs while watching a taped show; I tidied up and sat at the computer while he watched another show. It feels like the end of the week to me too, and what a lovely way it was to end it. I just totally relaxed and didn't do a productive thing after my lunch out... until this evening. Hard to believe it's Friday already! </p>
<p>P.S. Bryn IM'd tonight to say that Riku is starting piano lessons next week... Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:15 until 1:45. One of the mothers from his preschool will be the teacher. We are all hoping he enjoys them! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/12/dude_lets_go.html">"Dude... Let's Go!"</a></h2>
								<p>Oh, it was an early arising today. Doug woke me at 4:30 for a 4:45 departure for the airport. He is off to Kansas where it is very cold... just at freezing. Well, it's cold from our west coast viewpoint! I was back home and in bed with my warmed up bed buddies by 5:30 and asleep within minutes. I was very happy to get an extra two hours sleep in. </p>
<p>I had a very productive day at home. I answered a couple of emails but was determined to get birthday and anniversary cards organized for December through mid-January, as well as do the usual Monday washing. The cards take a long time, as I tend to write notes in the ones with whom I am not in touch via email... mostly the cards for the U.K. but a couple of other friends as well. The time flew by, as it always does; I took a quick walk to the mailbox to mail the ones for next week. The day had warmed up from the chilly morning; our temperature in the house hovers around 64F overnight, but with the sun up and shining brightly I don't need to leave the heat on for too long. </p>
<p>Akane arrived with Mirei at 2 o'clock as usual. She was a bright perky girl, having just awakened from a one and a half hour nap. Not that she doesn't smile her big smiles even when she's tired, though! First on the agenda... lunch time. She ate cereal and veggies, finished off with bananas and pears, and about half a teething biscuit; this kept her busy while pushing things off the table, one of her favourite things to do! Mirei made me laugh today, doing something she hadn't done here before, but apparently has been doing at home... she puts her head down on her arm,  which is lying flat on the table, and then looks up at me grinning away. It was obvious she wanted me to do the same thing and gave me that sweet Mirei laugh when I did so. Today I pointed out my ears to her and then took hold of hers. Then we did the same with the animals in the bedroom; she must be bored with touching noses so onward we go.  </p>
<p>We spent a little while upstairs in the master bedroom, just for a change. The room has lots of toys in it... a big container of plastic blocks and animals, Bryn's farm from when he was two years old, a Fisher-Price trailer of the same vintage, and another basket filled with children's books and stuffed animals. Mirei's favourite things to play with? Glad you asked. The phone with the seek button is what she heads for first! It drives her grandfather a little crazy as he can here it down here too, but my oh my, it makes her happy. What power! And today she learned how to turn it off too which is so very handy. It means she can make it ring over and over and over, and she does! </p>
<p>Grandpa's books on the lower shelf are of great interest to her too, but when forced to move away from them, she is quite happy to try to unplug the tv and/or music equipment instead. Now she can open my bedside drawers as well, all on her own, with some brute strength, but she does it, and there are all sorts of great things in there... little pots of lip salve, wooden rollers for my back, hand cream in tubes, a scented candle which used to sit on top until she discovered it tasted quite good. The room takes much longer to tidy up these days then it did just a week ago! </p>
<p>Then it was time to get up and move around. Bryn had mentioned the other day how fast Mirei is at getting around now and is she ever. One minute she is in the kitchen pulling herself up on the play kitchen in the eating area, and the next minute she has rebooted my computer and is on her way to the living room to stare at the folk art chickens. Mirei continues to purse up her lips in a tight little "oh" movement, and point around at whatever has caught her eye... the clock, the gum ball-like container that she is used to Doug shaking at her, or the frog perched way up on the hutch. Mirei is used to Doug being here to show her all these things, as he carries her around.Today I asked her where Grandpa was and she craned her neck around to where he usually sits at his computer.. and he wasn't there! I'm sure she wonders where he could be. </p>
<p>We left the house at 4:15 to meet Akane and Riku in the playground. He came running over to give me a hug, and when Mirei woke from her short nap, he gave her hugs and kisses too. He is always so happy to see her, and it's adorable to see her happy response to seeing him. Akane left to prepare dinner, Mirei didn't stay sleeping with the noise from playing children, so soon she was happily sitting in the sandbox with Riku and a little girl just over one year old. Mirei used to put everything into her mouth, but now only the interesting things go in... not the sand, but any little found objects... a stick yesterday. She responds very well to being told no so it's fun sitting there with her as she plays with the coarse sand and lets it run through her hands. She and the other child touched each others faces, and held hands, and looked at each other. Riku entertained us by running and then leaping into the sandbox, being careful to avoid coming close to the little ones. He is attempting to climb up the high dome there now; he really wants to do it and I think if his cousins were here he would be up at the top in no time. </p>
<p>At 5 P.M. it was getting cold, and so we left, strolling home slowly, which gave Riku lots of time to explore. He peeked under the bottoms of the new garages just built at the complex that has been going up for months and months, stopped to run his fingers through the lavender planted along the sides of that building, dashing to me to let Mirei and me smell, and checking out anything new along that street... a contrail today, and the comment that a dog that usually barks from behind a gated door was not home today. I explained what "strolling" was, dashing with his hand in mine at first, and then slowing way down so we could "stroll", a much nicer way to get home. At some point on this walk Riku looked up at me and said "Dude, let's go!" It was so funny and made me laugh out loud. He drags out the first word so it sounds like "duuuuuuddde," and then of course we both then started saying it, sometimes at the exact same moment, which made us both laugh out loud. What a funny boy he is. Bryn said later he learns so much from the children at school and this is one of them. I now hear talk of "power rangers" which is what he already plans to be for Hallowe'en next year. </p>
<p>The evening with the children and Bryn passed quickly... Riku played in the kitchen while I fed Mirei; Bryn came back from dropping Akane off for her 6 P.M. Chinese class, and we all sat at the table while Riku ate his dinner. He and I had some time playing on his bed with a sticker book; he was putting together a train scene and really enjoying it. Then it was PJ time, teeth brushed, and into bed for a long chapter in "Walter the Lazy Mouse". Bryn thought since it was so early he could hear two chapters tonight but it was obvious he was fast ready for tuck-in time. He was asleep before 7:30 but woke an hour later, possibly with a bad dream, so I snuggled in next to him for about ten or fifteen minutes until he was deep asleep again. </p>
<p>Bryn had cleaned the kitchen, tucked Mirei into bed, and had tea ready for us when I walked out the second time. He showed me some of the vintage Christmas tree ornaments he had just put top bids on through EBay and even managed to find a tree topper just like the one we have! It was never my favourite but both Bryn and Doug think it's just perfect. </p>
<p>We had a little time to chat about their trip to Ontario, although only got to the end of the first few days when he left at 9:10 to pick up Akane.  I did a little annotating on Amelia's online birthday photo album, and then walked home in the crisp cold but clear night, thanks to the full moon. Just gorgeous! </p>
<p>I had spoken with Doug on Skype this afternoon, just as he settled into his hotel room. He no doubt went off to bed early too; I was up the stairs with lights out by 11:15.</p>
<p>P.S. I remembered the next morning that Mirei had her first ride on the round-about at the playground and quite enjoyed it. She also managed to climb up two of the stairs on her own going up to the second floor! When I caught her at it, she turned and gave me a big smile as though to say "Just look how clever I am!" </p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/12/a_day_with_no_children.html">A Day with No Children...</a></h2>
								<p>... is truly like a day with no sunshine! This was the first time since I arrived home from Toronto, I believe, at the end of September, that I have not laid eyes for more than a few minutes on one of the three children here in the city. Bryn stopped in at 8:40 with their laundry, which meant I did have two minutes of sunshine as Riku was with him. He noticed a picture of Santa on the back of a Reader's Digest, asked if they were elves in the photo near the sleigh, and was obviously taken with the scene. I ripped off the back cover for him, and he studied it intently on the way to school Bryn said... just mesmerized by it. This is going to be such an exciting Christmas for him. </p>
<p>Bryn told me later in the day that he had been playing Stan Rogers as they often do on that trip to school. Following is the exchange that took place between them. Bryn said "He has a beautiful voice." Riku replied "But he died", to which Bryn said: "That's right... he didn't get to be an old man." Riku's response: "I will get to be an old man if you take care of me."</p>
<p>Ah, if only that were true! How very touching that Riku believes this... </p>
<p>Riku woke Bryn up at 6 A.M. today singing "Here Comes Santa Claus"! Bryn did manage to settle him back in for a little extra sleep though.</p>
<p>So, even though my day was childless and the house seemed far too quiet and lonely, I did get lots accomplished today. After wrapping the last of four boxes to mail to Toronto, I stopped to pick up some crochet hooks from a Potrero Hill gal from the Freecycle group. I know I am missing a few from my set, so these will come in very handy one day. On to the post office where there was a surprisingly short line; I bought lots of stamps for Christmas cards and we must get those out within the week. </p>
<p>Home for breakfast, a nice big one as Uncle Frank would say... egg, two slices of sourdough toast, two slices of "bacon", and a big mug of hot chocolate made with my now favourite "drinking chocolate" which Doug bought for me. Then it was time to get started on my day... laundry, and the big job of sorting through three large containers of various baby clothing... a stack for Mirei from Amelia, a stack from Riku for the new baby boy expected at the Ellis/Doering household in a few weeks, and a stack of clothing that may or may not suit one of the two little ones at some point in the future. It took a lot longer than I thought it would but I did get three drawers in the little downstairs bedroom neatly packed with some of the clothes that will fit Riku and Mirei now, with spares for them and Amelia too... T-shirts, warm sweaters, etc. </p>
<p>I chatted with Gail again today; she is having her colonoscopy tomorrow, finally! We hope to see what is going on with her pancreas, as she has been in pain for well over a month now. </p>
<p>Later tonight I phoned and chatted  for a long time with Uncle Frank. It was nice to have the extra free time to do this as it has been too long since we caught up in real time, and not via email. Neal called this morning as well, so it was a very productive phone day! </p>
<p>I was sort of expecting to hear from Akane today, to meet her at the playground with the children. She took Mirei with her to school today, wearing a front baby carrier I would think, so perhaps Mirei had slept in the morning and was set for an adventure on the bus and streetcars with her Mom. Riku was starting his first group piano lesson at 1:15 for I think a half hour. Bryn said later that he enjoyed it and  would go back. Good! We will all be so pleased if he plays the piano as his cousins do. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped in on his way home from work for a moment; I was busy on the phone chatting with a Freecycle member, from whom I had just acquired two free tickets and a free parking spot at the Cow Palace for the "Dickens' Christmas Fair" tickets. Doug and I took Riku to this event two years ago; he chose his first Christmas decoration there, although he was too young to appreciate the marvelous costumes and various British accents everyone working there puts on. We had talked about going but tickets are $20 each plus the charge for parking so this was a great find! I was the first to respond and the fellow who was giving them away was very pleasant and chatty. We will pick them up tomorrow and can go any weekend between now and Christmas. </p>
<p>The evening flew by; I called Toronto to talk with Bryn and Mykayla, both of whom I had missed talking to last weekend. What busy lives they all now lead! Caillie answered the phone and she just made me laugh so much. The first thing she did was tell me that the letter I had told her I had mailed to her had not arrived; it should have, but she realized that she hadn't checked the mail today. So, she put me on "hold"... just pretending, as she can't do that from home, and hummed along some elevator-type mindless music while checking the mailbox! When she had gone though it all she told me it hadn't arrived but she would check the "lost" mail section and see if she could find it. It should be there tomorrow for sure. I congratulated her on her very good report card (solid Bs with some As), and then she passed the phone to Bryn. He got seven As on his report card and is working on his two Bs to bring them up as well. He is enjoying middle school very much, and obviously thriving and enjoying it all. Myk' had been playing the piano in the background; she had forgotten her clarinet and so was practicing on the piano instead. She plays so well and it was a pleasure to hear her; she had made the decision to quit piano when I was there in the fall, much to all our regrets... she plays so well! </p>
<p>After my call, I made some tea and actually sat down and went through a few magazines, cleared the folk art chickens from the living room to make room for the Christmas decorations I pulled out from the cedar chest yesterday, and cleared away bits and pieces from here and there. Playing Christmas music all day helped get me in the spirit and I can't wait to get the house feeling like the season has arrived. </p>
<p>Doug called briefly to say that his flight from Kansas to Denver had been delayed due to winter weather, and so he was being flown to Washington/Dulles(!), to connect with a flight to San Francisco! Instead of arriving at 10:15 he was due in at 12:37.</p>
<p>In the end, Doug arrived at 12:05, and we were in bed by 12:45.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/12/this_is_cuddlin.html">"This is Cuddlin'..."</a></h2>
								<p>Too late to bed last night but I woke on my own at 7:45 and quickly got ready to leave the house for my 9 A.M. dermatologist appointment downtown. Doug drove me and waited for the forty-five minutes it took me to get in to see the doctor. Then we were on our way to pick up the free tickets to the Dickens' Christmas Fair at the Cow Palace over the next two weekends. The tickets and parking pass are worth $48 but cost us nothing, thanks to Bob via Freecycle. We had chatted on the phone for a few minutes last night, so it was lovely to meet him as he gave me the tickets. </p>
<p>We were close to Stonestown Mall; neither Doug nor I had been there for well over a year. We wanted to check out the Santa there for a visit with Riku and Amelia, but Doug doesn't like his fake smile so we will see what the downtown Macy's Santa is like. It was really lovely to just wander about the mall, though, admiring the Christmas decorations and listening to the Christmas music. I found clothes for all three children there, and we enjoyed our shared lunches at the Boudin sourdough bakery... broccoli cheese soup in a bread bowl, and a tuna sandwich on a sourdough baguette. Yum! </p>
<p>I drove over at 2 o'clock to pick up Mirei; she had just awakened from a good nap and was her usual bubbly happy self. She ate a big lunch of cereal and veggie stew, plus strained fruit and water, plus some bits of grapes as well. We played our usual game of "hats"; I put something... a plastic cup or bowl on my head, she admires it, I tip my head and it falls off, and then she tries to put it on her head. It's adorable. Or, if it stays on her head, when I have placed it there, she very carefully reaches up to take it off. We are still learning "ears" and she is just starting to point them out on various stuffed animals. And vocal! Oh yes! I couldn't believe how much noise she was making today, just keeping herself amused. </p>
<p>She stood by the coffee table in the living room, looking at books for at least twenty minutes(!) and staying busy, with no intervention at all from us. Riku would do the same thing at that age, and, in fact, still does. After dinner tonight, while I was cleaning up, he was sitting on the sofa, quietly looking through a Spanish language picture book. </p>
<p>And, despite falling from the first stair, Mirei was immediately back up at them, with me behind her, and got to the third stair before we had to leave. She doesn't give up easily, being quite tenacious; her mom has noticed this same trait. </p>
<p>Each day she gets steadier and steadier on her feet and more sure of herself, pulling up with just one hand. She is always quick to flirt with Doug. He noticed yesterday that she seems to know she can't just constantly go to him, so will approach him, sit quietly and wait until he moves his chair on wheels, and then give him the big smile she has been saving for him. He spends a lot of time walking her around the house pointing out her favourite things on the walls. </p>
<p>We didn't get to the playground until 4:35; we drove over because we were busy somehow right up until we left the house. Riku's first words when we got there were "Why you are so long getting here?" He played for a bit on the dome, but didn't want to run and kick the ball; he just wanted to come to my house, so Mirei didn't get to sit in the sandbox today, which she enjoys. They walked home and Riku and I drove; Doug was off to T'ai Chi at 5:30.</p>
<p>Riku quite amazes me in so many ways. Without being reminded or asked, the minute he takes off his coat and shoes he goes right into the bathroom, pulls up the stool, and washes his hands very well with soap and water. </p>
<p>Riku asked to look at his Easter basket of goodies. Last week he threw out all the chocolate he hadn't eaten, and he keeps his promise not to eat any candy until after dinner. He just enjoys lining up the candy, asking what various items are and offering to give our favourites to us. He knows about "rockets" and left out a package for Doug to eat after his dinner and I got a piece of red licorice as my treat. I don't know too many children who could or would just sit with candy right beside him and not even attempt to eat it until it was the time decided upon. He ate a great dinner too; he asked for mac' and cheese, ate a large portion of that along with chopped fresh tomatoes, two slices of "bacon", and a large number of steamed carrot sticks, as well as a bowl of grapes and vanilla soy milk. Then he ate the tiny orange candy he had chosen, after being told he couldn't have the chocolate Tootsie roll this late in the day. </p>
<p>Oh, he wanted to know tonight where the North Pole was and was happily singing Christmas songs throughout the afternoon and evening. He hums away to himself too; what a sweet boy he is! He also commented that Santa had a big tummy and he wondered if Mrs. Santa did too. </p>
<p>He was tired, and after Bryn had dropped in to say goodnight, I got him ready for bed. We read "The Lost Teddy Bear" from my Everyday Storybook, and he was more than ready to sleep. I walked out at 7:30 P.M. with Riku snoring lightly. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a really boring, predictable rental movie; we hadn't a clue that it was from a Christian site but once it got started it was obvious. I thankfully fell asleep as Doug was rubbing my back so missed most of it. Whew! Doug said it was the worst movie we have ever rented from Netflix! </p>
<p>Bryn was on IM: here is his message about their evening with Mirei<br />
"It was a DELIGHT to have her alone at dinner. Tonight she grabbed a finger on each of my hands (0% help from me) and walked six or seven steps; she just <strong>went</strong> too, as soon as she was in position." I had commented that she was now taking more reasonable sized steps... and Bryn replied "no giant steps... i will miss them!" and went on to say: "she made me gut laugh tonight... first time in AGES. She was taking a sip of water (via straw) then started blowing bubbles, we chuckled... she took the straw out, waited a minute... straw back in... she looked right at me and just blew furious bubbles right away. We howled... she was really watching us react. It is really nice to have a "private" dinner with her once a week... extended 1+ hours in the kitchen with no interruption." He finished up with a new observation about tucking Mirei in "last night was interesting... i was holding her as i always do... after five minutes, she was still awake but wiggling... i realized after a bit that she WANTED to be put in the crib... before she was asleep." She is learning to be independent I guess! </p>
<p>Gail had five biopsies done today during her colonoscopy; she now has two weeks to wait for the results, but is still in pain, and still in the dark about what is going on with her. Not a good time for all of this to be going on although the good news is that her amylase count is up, so it isn't her pancreas causing the problems she is having... but what is?  </p>
<p>...as for my blog title... Riku and I were snuggling in bed after his story tonight and he mumbled something to me. I didn't quite catch it and said "Pardon?" to which he replied, snuggling in even closer to me... "This is cuddlin'" Yes, it is and very nice too! </p>
<p>Bed at 11:30.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/12/a_visit_with_riku_and_mirei.html">A Visit with Riku and Mirei</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn dropped Riku off here this morning, later than I expected, as Riku had gone to bed later than usual lat night, and had slept in a bit today.</p>
<p>We were heading off to the Bay Area Discovery Museum with Susan and Amelia, and there was time to get a nice big bowl of cereal into him, especially good as it keeps him happy when he is a little short on sleep. Both children are ready for earlier than usual lunches too. after running around the playground.  </p>
<p>It was <strong>so</strong> cold here today! The temp' in the house was down to 60ºF this morning again ... brrrr! There was frost on the car across the street today and yesterday too; if it had rained we would have snow! Crazy weather for us to have here and I am not used to it.</p>
<p>The children had lots of fun, as always, and kept so busy with the inside and outside activities. They kept warm running around, and thank goodness the sun came out and warmed things up on the other side of the Golden Gate bridge. A big cup of hot tea helped while the children played on the boat. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I forgot my camera at home this morning and so only have shots of the children at home today. I'm hoping to get some from Susan from our outing, though, as she always takes great shots of them. </p>
<p>Despite the busy hours there, Riku stayed awake the entire way home; I couldn't believe it, especially after all the food he ate! However, three minutes from the house his eyes started to close. I played a little "windstorm" game by opening and closing the windows in the car. It worked; he was giggling away and we made it home. I could have put him down for a nap but it made more sense to me to have him ready for an earlier bedtime.</p>
<p> I picked up Mirei, leaving Riku with Doug for a few minutes. Doug has been really busy  working on a project for work today, so it was good for them to have a little time alone together, before busy Mirei arrived. She and Riku had some time to play together. How this little girl loves to watch every little thing that Riku does, and tries so hard to do whatever it is along with him. They played in the living room, in the bedroom with the cars, and then shared a gingerbread cookie in the kitchen too. Mirei spotted Riku with one, and not willing to be left out, went up to him making it clear she wanted some as well. Riku is always very generous with her, and happily broke off a piece for her. </p>
<p>Mirei looked dressed for the holidays in a gorgeous little pair of pinky red silk pants of Amelia's, which I had never seen on Amelia. Mirei's big smiles and happy demeanor make every day feel special, though, even without the festive togs. </p>
<p>Riku put together two puzzles while I fed her and tucked her in at 4:30, later than would have been ideal, but she napped late with Akane this morning at home. She has a little cold and certainly needed the extra rest. She slept until 6 P.M.</p>
<p>As soon as she was asleep, Riku and I went upstairs to watch "Charlie Brown's Christmas", which arrived in the mail today along with the others we had ordered.<br />
 <br />
Bryn told me earlier he would be running some errands, and would be later than usual picking Riku up, so I asked if Riku could just sleep here. I really wanted him in bed at 7 as he was tired, so this made sense for all of us. Mirei would have been full of energy just when Riku was flagging and needing the house quieter. After a good dinner, and a long fun tub time Riku was asleep at 7:05! Good thing too, as Bryn is taking him for breakfast at Jim's at 8 a.m. with Brent and Mari. </p>
<p>I made up a new batch of gingerbread and worked on writing messages in our last three Christmas cards. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/12/riku_charlotte_and_an_evening_1.html">Riku, Charlotte, and an Evening at Hampshire Street</a></h2>
								<p>Quiet morning at home today, catching up on a few emails, reading the paper while eating breakfast, enjoying Judi's blackberry jam on Acme bread. This is one of the things I will miss most about the Bay Area... this wonderful bread always available! </p>
<p>I called Denver to speak to Uncle Frank in his new rehab centre; he was a little dozy but had his physio this morning and a good hearty breakfast. As soon as he finds out what is causing the dizziness and pain in his groin, he will be a happy camper, as he is so keen to get on with recovering from his surgery and getting out of the hospital setting. We didn't talk too long today, but he was happy to have a call, and filled me in on his treatment and better meals there. </p>
<p>Akane had called to suggest that today would be a good day to take Riku to the movies; "Charlotte's Web" was on our list. I spent an hour going through bags of clothes, and giveaway household items for the Goodwill, and packaged up five full bags ready to leave the house with us. This is the first of a major cleaning out I plan to do in 2007. </p>
<p>We picked Riku up at 12:45 (Bryn was tucking Mirei in, but she was up for more food shortly after that; this is a girl who wants a full tummy before she goes to sleep and makes her needs known too!), and I had lots of fun with Riku displaying his sunglasses on top of his head, pretending to be a "dude", making me laugh. Parking was easy, and Riku ran down all the hills on our way to the theatre. He stood with Doug buying tickets, looked at all the movie posters with great interest, and found seats with Doug while I bought the popcorn. There were lots of trailers, which Riku enjoyed, with questions about whether they looked scary to me, or OK. We munched on popcorn andate a couple of Twizzlers; I had apple juice with me for Riku. The movie was just great. Riku sat on his own seat for most of it, really taking it all in, and paying attention. I got a little snuggle in too, for a few minutes halfway through. </p>
<p>After the movie we raced each other from one tree or post to another, uphill to our car. Riku was tired but happy, and we dropped off the bags for Goodwill and then went off for some gelato near Amelia's old school. Riku and I had coconut, while Grandpa tried the strawberry. Yum! </p>
<p>We thought Bryn, Akane, and Mirei might be home, so we stopped in there, but headed for our house to wait for them when we found the house empty. Much to our surprise, they were already here, so we had tea and gingerbread, Riku played upstairs with his cars on his own, and Mirei made us all smile. She was sitting at the table, having polished off two jars of fruit and some veggies I heated up for her as well. What a grand little eater she is! </p>
<p>Doug and I had a light dinner at home, finished off a crossword puzzle, checked and wrote some emails, and headed over to Hampshire Street at 7:45 to babysit while Akane and Bryn went to a concert, a Christmas gift to Akane from Bryn. </p>
<p>Riku was already tucked into bed; this is his third night of falling asleep on his own and he didn't call out once... just two nights of trying and he's got it down flat! He did waken with a dream once and twice more, but for just seconds, before rolling over and sleeping again. </p>
<p>Mirei and I listened to a little music box from Japan, inspected the decorations on the tree, and I watched her explore the living room while waiting for Doug to come back from driving Akane & Bryn to the concert. She was soon rubbing her eyes, but once again made it perfectly clear that she needed more to eat before settling down for the night. </p>
<p>She ate a big bowl of oatmeal with blueberries, polishing it off in no time, while sitting on Doug's lap watching the tree lights. She looked so darling in her little sleeper blanket, putting her index finger to her mouth to let us know it was sleepy time... "shhhhh". Mirei also made it clear that she wanted to go right into her crib, and not be held as her dad had suggested. It's interesting as she just may know that is not how we do it at my house with me; I simply lay her down and put a hand on her tummy or leg, and then she figures out how to slip off to sleep. I was out of the room in less than five minutes this second time. </p>
<p>The rest of the evening was uneventful; Doug and I watched two episodes of a popular TV show we don't get, and then watched most of a wonderful British movie called "Goodnight Mr. Tom" which we had seen years before but enjoyed just as much the second time around. I had a little trouble staying awake during the cops and robbers shows, but was wide awake for the last of the evening. Doug picked the concert goers up at 12:40 and we were home just shortly after 1, and watching the last half hour of the movie. Bed at 2 A.M. for me. </p>
