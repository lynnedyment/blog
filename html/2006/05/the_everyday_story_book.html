								<h2>"The Everyday Story Book"</h2>
								<p>In June 1951, at the end of grade one, I won the reading award, given to the best reader in the grade. My prize was a book, which I dearly loved, called "The Everyday Story Book". It contains seven stories, one for each day of the week. Somehow, it managed to survive a household with ten children growing up in it! It had been dribbled on, scribbled in, and, in my own grade one printing, I had written in protest on one of the pages, "do not skribble in this book." You can still see it but I'm so glad I wrote it in pencil!  </p>
<p>I also underlined what I thought were some obviously disturbing (to me) sentences in one of the stories... about Jiggers, a little dog who gets locked into a house on his own. I underlined "The house was cold", "There was no fire", and "There was no one to feed him or give him a drink". I think this is my very favourite story of all. Throughout the pages you can see where various brothers and sisters took their pencils to the book too. </p>
<p>The book was in bad shape after all those years; the front cover had come off, the last page of the last story was torn, the title page was torn in half, and the certificate that announced my award was still there, amazingly enough, on the torn page. </p>
<p>One of the best presents I ever received was given to me about six years ago. Kelly, unbeknownst to me on one of her visits to San Francisco, had taken the book home with her. I had been reading it to  Bryn and Caillie, just as I read it to their Mom and Uncle Bryn many years ago, and to the children I babysat in Vancouver. </p>
<p>For my birthday that year, Kelly had arranged to have it completely redone for me. It sports a new binding, reinforced corners, two dark green double pages at the front (with two small pictures from the torn page permanently attached to them), and a fine job of a special transparent material covering the torn page. It was such a thoughtful and priceless gift to me; it meant a lot to me and reminded me of how much I love to read, and from such an early age. </p>
<p>Riku and Amelia both love being read to, and each chooses two stories at nap time, as well as any time throughout their visits with me. We have a lot of books in the house for them; I often read the same stories over and over, and then they get put aside for a while, until we rediscover them. However, last week I thought of this special book, and this morning came across it as I was tidying up the front bedroom. I took it with me for the car ride home from school with Riku.</p>
<p>While Doug picked up two slices of wonderful "designer" style pizza for us (Wednesdays was made with thin potato slices, grilled red onions, and pesto sauce... it was sooo good; today was grilled kabocha squash, red onion, garlic oil, and fontina cheese), Riku chose two stories to read, and another when we got home. He liked the stories and the pictures, just as I knew he would.</p>
<p>I shall name all seven stories, as I know my younger siblings will remember them well too. They start with "Sally's Lost Shoe", "A New Pet", "Jiggers" (my favourite), Teddy's Sailboat", "The Make-Believe Picnic", "The Lost Teddy Bear", and finally "Mumpsy Goes to Kindergarten".  </p>
<p>Riku was a tired fellow at pick-up, happy, but he didn't come running out with his usual big smile today, and as soon as we pulled into the driveway he said "I want to go to sleep right now." We read one more story, and he was asleep before I got to "the babies on the bus... ", less than five minutes from tuck-in to door shut. </p>
<p>He was groggy and pale after two solid hours of sleep; he awoke slowly, wanting to be in my arms and snuggling for the longest time. He would have gone back to sleep with no problem at all, but it was 4 P.M. when he awoke and that was late enough. His skin was itchy too, with fine bumps on his back, tummy, and arms. I tried to talk him into a tub so that he could relax and then I could get some cream on him. Usually he's up for this, but not today. </p>
<p>It was warm outside but the wind was blowing hard. Riku was easily talked into going outside to the yard for some fresh air once he noticed some workmen in our yard, working on the house being renovated beside us. He dragged out his Easter bucket filled to the brim with some of his favourite items... flashlight, necklaces, a few animals, etc., and about four of his trucks as well. I noticed him pointing them out to the friendly workers, even demonstrating what noise they made, much to their enjoyment. </p>
<p>Soon he was back to being his own sweet self, and ate up every bite of some scrambled egg, two slices of "bacon", a full slice of toast, and a glass of soy milk. He ate up all his lunch at noon hour too, so I wonder if he is in a growth spurt. I can't seem to keep him filled up these days! </p>
<p>Off to Costo with Akane and Mirei, whom we picked up at the studio at 5:45. An hour later we dropped them at home, came home and took our leftover Lu Lai dinner upstairs to eat while watching "Good Night, and Good Luck", a movie about Edward R. Murrow and the McCarthy hearings. It was wonderfully done.. and so well acted. I even stayed awake for it all! </p>
<p>I didn't get one photo of either child today; this might be a first.. sad. Bed at 11 P.M.</p>
<p>P.S. Gail is going full tilt on our family history, making new discoveries several times a week! She is back to 1803 on one side, and 1807 on another. We are so excited about this and I can't wait to get at it with her.</p>
