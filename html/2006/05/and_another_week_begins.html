								<h2>And Another Week Begins...</h2>
								<p>I slept until 8:35 this morning! I have no idea what is going on with my sleep pattern, but I have slept in later this week than the entire year put together. </p>
<p>I made up for lost time though, by getting the washing started immediately, answering lots of emails, and showering before finally sitting down to eat breakfast. Still, it seemed no time at all had passed before it was 12:40 and Doug and I were heading out the door to pick up Riku. </p>
<p>I assumed it was going to be as hot today as it was yesterday, but it was cool and foggy over on the other side of the city. Riku came bounding out of school wearing shorts and a short-sleeved shirt, which would be fine in Potrero Hill, and fine indoors at school too, but when we walked down to meet Grandpa at the bakery Riku cuddled into Doug's arms for the trip back to the car. </p>
<p>I took along the new book Doug had just given him yesterday, "No Cats Allowed", so that I could read to Riku and maybe keep him awake on the way home. Bryn thought he might be extra tired since the heat last night kept him awake longer than usual. He was just fine, however, and asked for ten minutes on the timer to play before we headed in for his nap. He even delayed a bit longer by telling me he had to finish his soy milk before he could nap... and his drawing wasn't finished either. </p>
<p>He napped for one and a half hours, still not quite ready to waken but not wanting to be left alone in bed either. However, I left the door open and told him he could sleep more or get up. This kept him in bed a bit longer but he finally just wanted me to snuggle with him and we giggled him awake slowly but surely. </p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon passed quickly. It was warm enough that he just wandered around in his underwear, indoors and out, busy with the wheelbarrow for a bit, and collecting rocks to fill it up. </p>
<p>Doug gave him an old digital camera which thrilled him to bits. It even has its own camera case! He went outside and snapped dozens of photos of spit bugs, a current fascination ("What is saliva?"), and took some indoor shots too. At one point he realized "it's not working!" as he couldn't see through the little screen and knows he should be able to. However, it wasn't a huge worry, and kept him busy for a long while. </p>
<p>I went upstairs to change the bedding, and after a bit Riku came up telling me, "I didn't know where you were. I was calling 'Nana, Nana', and you were not answering." After coming back downstairs he asked for the big and mostly ignored basket of toys from the laundry room, and spent the rest of the afternoon digging through it, rediscovering old treasures. </p>
<p>One of the things he found was a soft pre-dressed baby; he is such a good daddy, and carefully picked her up and insisted that Doug wait until he wrapped her in a "blanket"... a little jacket, before they went down to check on the mail. He lay her carefully on the floor beside him as he played with some other toys, but would look over at the doll occasionally, telling her "shhhh", and "It's okay; go to sleep." </p>
<p>Dinner time at 6 P.M. (we had salmon, new potatoes, broccoli, and steamed carrots) and Riku repeated after Doug at the end of the meal "What's forrrr dessert?". He and Bryn do this at home too; it's a Dyment ritual. I put out our special dessert bowls, from way back at the farm days in the 70s... bought at my first auction... filled with custard and strawberries. Those guys just polished them off in no time, as did Bryn with the bowl I put out for him, when he came to say goodnight to Riku. </p>
<p>Riku played with his animals in the tub, singing out in a loud voice "Old McDonald Had a Farm" as he lined them up along the edge. He also sang a Japanese song today at naptime, putting his index and thumbs together and then swinging his arms out and putting his hands under his armpits. It will be interesting to learn from Akane what the words mean. </p>
<p>Riku is like Caillie, and gets very warm as he settles into a sleep, so I ended up taking his undershirt off after he tossed and turned longer than usual. This did the trick and he was soon asleep, at 8:40 rather than the 8:10 I was aiming for. When he gets hot, he itches and so the scratching went on for a bit... </p>
<p>I'm expecting to be turning in shortly myself; it's 10:45 and no doubt Riku will be awake between 6:30 and 7 A.M. as usual.</p>
