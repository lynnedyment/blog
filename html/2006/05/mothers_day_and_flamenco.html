								<h2>Mothers' Day and Flamenco!</h2>
								<p>This day started out in a very lazy fashion... sleeping in until 8 A.M. and then sitting in bed chatting with Kelly, who called just minutes after I awoke. </p>
<p>She is without her children today, as they are with Hans at his Mom's this weekend. So, instead she got up early with the dogs, went for a long run, and came home to a lovely breakast and card from Gregg. </p>
<p>My gift from Kelly was to be a long soak at the Kabuki but we talked about the new photo program from Creative Memories and I may get that instead.... Doug has no idea when I am going to find the time for yet another project but I'm an optimist! </p>
<p>I dashed into the shower immediately, but hadn't finished drying my hair when I heard a little tap on the bathroom door. There stood Riku with a <strong>huge</strong> bouquet of beautiful red tulips, eighteen in all! He said "Happy Mothers' Day!" and immediately dashed downstairs to start playing. </p>
<p>Akane, Bryn, and Mirei were here as well, and Bryn got started immediately on the fresh scones he had promised to make for breakfast. He also scrambled eggs and cooked bacon for Akane, Doug set the table, and I got to spend most of that time smiling at Mirei who was just beaming away in her usual fashion. We had stewed tomatoes, and veggie "bacon" and "sausage" too. The current scones were light and delicious, although Bryn says he will make them thicker the next time, and perhaps use a different recipe, since he thought they were lacking in what he thinks is a real scone flavour. </p>
<p>Susan called from the plane at 10:15 to say goodbye (Amelia said hello as well); they were preparing to take off fifteen minutes later for Vancouver, and then Vancouver Island. They will be with Susan's mom for Mothers' Day.</p>
<p>While breakfast was being prepared, Doug got on the net and booked Uncle Frank's and my flight from Denver to Toronto. I leave in two weeks exactly for Denver, and the following day we leave for the Falls. I am scheduled to return on the 28th of June. </p>
<p>The plan for today was for all of us to go to SFMOMA, but Riku had napped only twenty minutes yesterday and was in sore need of an early nap. I sent Bryn, Akane, and Mirei off to the gallery and Doug and I stayed home with Riku; he was asleep within minutes of being tucked in. </p>
<p>It was hot here today, the hottest day we have had so far, so Bryn and Akane returned here two hours later, just as Riku was wakening from his hour and a half nap. It's much cooler at our place than at theirs, so Bryn locked himself in the front bedroom to work, Akane started the laundry they brought over, and Riku played in the yard with the wheelbarrow, but running in and out to chat with us too. Mirei got some attention; I took lots of photos of her, and then she settled in to a nap in Riku's room. </p>
<p>The afternoon flew by and at 6:30 Doug and I set off for an evening of flamenco music and dance, a gift from our downstairs neighbour as thanks for babysitting their daughter Oona one evening many weeks ago. the first half was all singing, which dragged a little. It's hard for us to sit and listen to music, when we don't understand a word of what is being said (it being all in Spanish), but the second half was just wonderful. This was our first full exposure to flamenco (Doug had seen some at a folk festival years ago) but Karyn had arranged for front row seats for us, at at fairly small club, and it was terrific. I was quite amazed by the drama of it all, and the interaction between the dancers and the musicians. Apparently, in most cases, the audience takes more part in throwing out calls of "ole" too, but we were mostly an audience of gringos and not doing our part. The owner of the club is a woman in her fifties perhaps, and was just the most terrific dancer; she is in amazing physical shape and I am not surprised! She was breathing less hard than the two much younger women dancers and doing more intricate footwork too. </p>
<p>We were home at 9:30 P.M., did some emailing (I had so many emails in from friends today; it was lovely!), and I caught up on the Sunday paper. I was sleepy, but managed to stay awake and read until midnight, when I finally turned out the light on my side of the bed.</p>
