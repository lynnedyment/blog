								<h2>Happy Birthday, Gram day.... and Riku too!</h2>
								<p>My morning disappeared in no time today... Skyped with Kelly first, who called me from Savannah, Georgia. She was on her way to soak in the hot tub and sauna before having a 70-minute river rock massage. She had already run for four miles, and Gregg had brought some fruit and a little quiche up to the room for her breakfast. Meanwhile, Gregg was already at his cooking class, so Kelly dashed off, promising to call later and fill me in on how the massage was. </p>
<p>Then I phoned Beth and we talked about her big beautiful new house; she is delighted with it, loving the quiet surroundings and all the trees and space around her. She and Paul are pretty well unpacked and organized, except for purchasing two wardrobes for their closetless bedroom, the kitchen is set up, and she is looking forward to opening the pool at the end of the month. </p>
<p>Next on my phone list was Uncle Frank; Virginia answered and said they were just sitting in the kitchen having tea on an overcast morning. It was overcast here as well, so we had a nice long chat about "The Da Vinci Code", which UF is just six pages from finishing, and talked more about when he might be given permission to fly home. </p>
<p>I just had time to shower, Skype with Gail for a bit about photos, grab a quick breakfast, and dash out the door to meet Riku. As always, Riku just comes bursting out of the room and up the few stairs, with his big welcoming smile, but this time wearing a tri-cornered paper hat, threatening to fall off at any second, which it did, several times, and carrying a bright and beautifully coloured fish flag with a twirling gold top on it. He insisted on having both in the back seat with him, and it was quite a struggle to manage it all and drink his soy milk as well. </p>
<p>However, once that was done, he had such a hard time keeping his eyes open. He lost the battle on Potrero Avenue, and I had to carry a very sleepy boy up the stairs and straight into bed. He was chilly as I stripped him down for his nap (he gets too hot with more than just his underwear on), so cuddled him into the soft pink heart blanket I had bought for Mirei. Amelia loved it yesterday too, so it will be well worn in by the time Mirei uses it. </p>
<p>Riku napped for two hours... was asleep by 1:40 and struggling to awaken at the end of that two hours. He awoke with a dream, I think, and a hard cry at the end of the first hour, and would happily have gone back to sleep with any encouragement after two. However, I try very hard to not disrupt his night routine, so cuddled him for the longest time, slowly having him decide what he wanted to do with the rest of his time here. </p>
<p>It was still cool and overcast, he was hungry, so I prepared a big snack, and we went upstairs to watch a short but sweet new video for him, one of Bryn's and Caillie's. It is called "Old Bear", and has animated soft animals with British accents. Riku was enchanted and smiled away as he watched it with me. He had some of Grandpa's "special" toast (cinnamon and apple), a half portion of cereal, and strawberries, orange segments, and a half of my banana! </p>
<p>As soon as that was over, in just a half hour, we sat and built with Lego, mostly playing with the farm. He sat on the train for a bit too, although he doesn't use it very often. Today it was appealing to him and he took his toys for a ride in the caboose. That's where he was when Bryn walked in to pick him up. After a bit he had Bryn close his eyes so he could show him the hat and fish flag... too cute. Oh, Riku also took a photo of me wearing the hat too; he was delighted to see the results. </p>
<p>They went off home for dinner, just as Kelly called to let me know she had enjoyed the massage but wouldn't likely choose to have another. Next up for them is a cruise up the river to a Crab Shack for dinner. </p>
<p>I answered a few emails before Doug came in from work. We had small bowls of chili and took them upstairs to eat with some tortilla chips, while watching a British Masterpiece Theatre taped film. We both really enjoyed "Carrie's War", a story of a young brother and sister evacuated out of London during the Blitz. </p>
<p>We both answered emails for a while and ended the evening with a taped TV show; we're trying to get caught up before I leave for Ontario, but it's a challenge with Doug away so much lately as well. </p>
<p>I always think I will get to bed earlier for some reading time, but tonight didn't turn the light out until 12:45. Doug gave in before I did; he has T'ai Chi in the morning and so had an excuse for turning in earlier. </p>
<p>Gram would have been 106 today! How I miss her in my life...</p>
