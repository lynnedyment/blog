								<h2>"Do You Want to Talk About Dreams?"</h2>
								<p>I turned off my reading light at 2 A.M. this morning and was awake at 7:45; I decided to get up and on with my day and go to bed early tonight. I'm on my way as soon as I write this. </p>
<p>Bryn IM'd this morning with news of Riku's night and morning; here is a little excerpt: </p>
<p>Bryn: this morning i asked riku where mirei and mommy were (i wstill in bed... he had been up and came back into his room to talk to me)</p>
<p>Riku: "mirei is in the big bed"... i asked, "sleeping?"... "no, she is awake"</p>
<p>Bryn: "and mommy?"</p>
<p>Riku:"mommy is VERY awake"</p>
<p>Bryn: he gets me to do push-ups in the morning now.</p>
<p>Doug and I picked Riku up at 1 P.M.; we read "The Three Pigs" on the way home and even though he had eaten all his lunch at school, drank a full container of vanilla soy milk on the way home, just as I was about to tuck him in... the timer had already gone off, he told me he was hungry. Talk about a well-timed delaying tactic but he was hungry indeed; he had six small pieces of cheese, a half slice of Doug's cinnamon/apple bread, and another very small cup of soy milk. I can see his face getting more round by the day! </p>
<p>It was a good thing Bryn had mentioned the push-ups to me as, just as Riku was settling in for his nap, he piped up with "Oh, I forgot to do my pushups!" I reassured him he could do them after his nap. </p>
<p>Riku's day in a nutshell... nice nap, with some pillow "fighting" before he got out of bed. Then he dragged out the wooden blocks from under the bed, that used to be his Grandpa's and then his aunt's and dad's, and we sat on the floor of the living room for the longest time. Riku built a very impressive city and playground and I built a sandbox for it. Riku put little wooden knobs for people... Auntie Susan and I sat on the bench while he, Amelia, and Diego sat in the sandbox. </p>
<p>I did some video recording of him sitting there, busy with his town; I really wanted to catch him chatting away to himself as he built, but he engaged me in his conversation and somehow got on the topic of policemen and bad guys. I don't do enough recording of any of the children and must do so. </p>
<p>He swept in the garden for a while and carried more stones to his wheelbarrow, he had a nice big dinner of spaghetti with three veggies, followed by a long tub time. Bryn and Brent came in just as I had taken him out of the tub. He had a little time with Brent while Doug and Bryn chatted for a few minutes and then we went back to building. </p>
<p>Riku is very clear these days about wanting his current projects left just as they are. "Don't put these away, okay?" and "Leave those right there; I will play with them next time!"  and once I had "You promise?" with those eyebrows raised as he said it. </p>
<p>Before going to bed, he watched the video I took of Mirei on Saturday and the footage of him today. He laughed so hard when he saw Mirei batting away at her toys; her arms were actually blurry as she was moving so quickly, and of course he was quite intrigued to see himself too.  </p>
<p>He took a while to fall asleep tonight; seemed to be settling nicely and then would pop up with a question, just as I was thinking I could leave the room. "What was that funny noise?", and "Tomorrow Daddy is picking me up?", and the best of all "Do you want to talk about dreams?" No, thank you, I would like your little mind to stop turning and go to sleep. </p>
<p>Oh, one other funny thing that happened was that I got a serious stitch in my side as I was lying beside Riku settling him in for the night. He heard me gasp although I was trying hard not to make any noise at all; however, I guess he could sense all was not well, so he asked in the most concerned voice "Are you okay, Nana?" I told him I really really hurt and he immediately said "Would you like me to get some ice? That will make it feel better." It was so sweet, and I told him I would be fine. He rolled over and put his hand on my neck and said "It will be okay, Nana. It will be okay."... and after a few deep breaths it was. I thought there thinking what a wonderful doctor our little "Dr. Dyment" is with his kind and concerned bedside manner. </p>
<p>I tidied up, answered lots of emails, wrote my blog, and went off to bed at 10:45, expecting that my day will start around 6:30 A.M.</p>
