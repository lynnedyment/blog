								<h2>Denver to Toronto</h2>
								<p>The household in Denver awakens at 8 A.M. I woke at 7:20 and just lay in bed reading until I heard everyone up. The plan was to go out for breakfast, so after a glass of orange juice we were all ready to leave the house by 9:15. We drove to a place where they had eaten dinner a few nights ago, called "The Village Inn"; Uncle Frank and I had eggs and toast with potatoes, Virginia and Joe had the pancakes. I got a lovely big insulated pot of tea with another pot of hot water; what a treat to not have to dunk my tea bag in a mug! Small things make me happy. </p>
<p>We went back to the house right away to pack up for the trip to Toronto. I wrote a note to Joe and Virginia, leaving it on a box of Joseph Schmidt truffles for them, to be discovered after I left, and Virginia was pleased with the loaf of sourdough bread as well. Uncle Frank carefully planned his gift to them, leaving it on his bed... a new keyboard and mouse for their computer.</p>
<p>At noon hour my hosts busied themselves in the kitchen, calling us to the table for a shared "Amy's vegetarian pizza with vegetables", and a delicious salad prepared by Joe: mixed greens with red pepper, onion, cubes of avocado, and tomatoes. We had iced tea and a cookie with it, and set off at 1:15 for the drive to the airport. We soon had the ordered wheelchair for UF, and said our goodbyes to Virginia and Joe, who stayed to wave goodbye from an upper deck until we were through security. </p>
<p>Our flight was delayed for twenty minutes, so we had lots of time for a slow walk to a cafe for a cold drink. I had purchased a sandwich for this flight at Rainbow yesterday... a grilled tofu with field greens and pesto, and UF bought a roast beef and cheese on a bun. Once again we lucked out with seats; I had booked us a window and an aisle and even though the plane was close to being full, we didn't have to share that third seat. UF was very pleased with our "picnic" dinner. I had two oranges and some organic grapes with me. We ate our sandwiches, and then topped that off with some delicious chocolates Akane had packed in with the inari and noodle dishes. Lucky us! </p>
<p>By' and Jo' were there to meet us at 9:30; we were the last off the plane, and the bags took a long time to get to us, but by 10:45 we were home in hot and humid Niagara Falls. We had been told on the plane that the temperature in Toronto was 33C and everyone groaned. It was 86F in the house, and in no time By' had the AC going and we were looking forward to being cool again. Uncle Frank so loved the weather in Denver... blue skies in the mornings, lightly clouding over in the afternoon, but with dry air always. He will miss it, but most likely will be back this summer for a second surgery. </p>
<p>By, Jo', and UF each had a beer, UF's first alcohol in seven or eight weeks as Joe and Virginia do not drink. Jo' had brought over a plate of delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies, so we indulged and each had one. UF is down to 161 pounds(!) and would be happy to keep his weight down to under 165. We shall have to try to stick to Virginia's spa diet, which consists of very small portions of everything they eat.</p>
<p>Jo' and By' left about 12:30, and UF and I headed upstairs to bed soon after. I was worried about the stairs but he does amazingly well on them; he is now using two canes but on the stairs goes up as he did before the surgery. Lights out at 1:15 A.M.</p>
<p>p.s. Doug wrote later to say that Akane, Bryn, and the children had been over later in the day after a few hours at the beach with Susan, Kevin, and Amelia. Akane was doing laundry and they ended up staying for dinner, which Akane prepared there; while she was busy with that, Riku was also busy making a very large and elaborate "dinner" in the backyard on the picnic table... he took out all of his plates, cups, and glasses, pulled lots of grasses and greens from the garden and had quite a feast all ready for everyone. What a guy!</p>
