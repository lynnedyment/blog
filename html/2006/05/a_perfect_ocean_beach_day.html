								<h2>A Perfect Ocean Beach Day</h2>
								<p>Doug went off to work today on the bus at 8:15; he is working in downtown SF all week, and our "internal" clocks went off just before 7 A.M. Laundry day today, and the ironing is building up again. Just don't feel like ironing lately. Wrote a few very long overdue emails to Carol Woods, and to Joe Price in the Manitoulin; nice to finally be catching up again. My goal is to have zero emails when I leave for Denver! </p>
<p>I tried to call Beth in her new home, but she was out; I did manage a great long talk with Uncle Frank. Virginia kindly emailed and told me they were home all morning; I caught Uncle Frank in the back yard strolling about. We made plans to book our flight from Denver home to the Falls around May 22nd. He sounded well if a little frustrated at what he sees as a lack of progress, but it was a big surgery and will take time. </p>
<p>Riku came bounding out of school with that big smile for me, and from the minute the car started moving, he just sang and sang. He started out with "The Farmer in the Dell" which is an obvious favourite right now; we sang away together and had a grand ol' time. Later on came "Old MacDonald"; he played for "ten minutes" and was sound asleep in less than that once we had read his story... a new book for him but an old one of his Daddy's... "Mr. Dressup, the Babysitter". Riku enjoyed it so much, and had lots of questions about the problems with having a baby elephant in a house!  </p>
<p>Bryn IM-ed me while Riku was napping, and told me that Riku has just started substituting sea creatures for the farm animals. I learned that the jelly fish is "sting sting here", "bite bite" for the shark, "blow blow" for the whale, and so on. He started singing these just as we were pulling into the driveway, although this time the whale was "splash splash here... ". This little boy loves to sing; it is the sweetest thing to just hear him singing away on his own, starting up a new song as soon as he finished off the last. A popular one right now is the beginning of a nursery song Akane sings to Mirei, but which Riku finishes off with part of an Ultraman song, his Japanese action hero figure. </p>
<p>Riku napped for an hour and a half, as did Amelia! Susan called just as Riku woke and suggested a trip to Ocean Beach. I quickly packed up a snack, and off we went at 4 P.M. Traffic was light, and we pulled into the parking lot twenty-five minutes later. Amelia and Susan were waiting for us, and the children had a grand time, right up to 6:10. Riku wanted to dig a big hole, and we did so, and then Amelia wanted to take one of his big plastic trucks to the water. Instead she ran at full speed pushing it ahead of her; considering she had to bend way over to do so, she was just amazing, not even tripping once. Heads were turning as it was the cutest thing to see. </p>
<p>Riku and I had decided not to carry a truck along with us, and even though he might have enjoyed pushing it along, he had lots of fun chasing after Amelia and inspecting the tire treads in the sand from the emergency beach vehicle. Amelia went a long way down the beach and Riku was determined to stop and do a thorough inspection every few feet, so it took a long time to get back to our blanket. I took lots of great photos of the two of them, and of Susan and Amelia playing in the water towards the end.</p>
<p>Riku decided he wanted a tub before he ate, which worked out well. I made him a veggie-loaded noodle soup, he drank lots of soy milk, and we all ate together when Doug got home.</p>
<p>Riku had gone to the bathroom just before his tub, and of course flushed the toilet as he always does. I was in the bathroom with him and he looked at me and said "Nana, say this: Oh, I wanted to do that!" Of course I repeated it right back to him and his reply was "Oh, too bad, you were too slow!" It was hilarious; he is already setting me up to be his straight man!</p>
<p>Bryn came by at 8:15, just as we had decided he wasn't coming; I had told Riku his daddy would be there, and it was good to see him walk in. Of course that meant getting out of bed and waving goodbye to him and to Brent, both off to play ping pong. Riku laughed as his daddy stuck his head out of sunroof (and Brent his hand), before pulling away.</p>
<p>We read the new book again tonight, and even though Riku was tired he had a few problems getting to sleep. First he needed water (I always forget to take it in with me) and then when he was almost asleep he had something bothering his eye. He started to cry a bit, as he said it was "picking" him. I got a cold cloth and he rubbed away at it, but even when trying to settle down again he kept reaching up to rub again. And his little dry spot on his ankle was bothering him... finally asleep at 9 P.M.  </p>
<p>I was too tired for a movie tonight, so went through 300 photos with Doug, managing to get them down to 100. I took so many today but of course had been taking photos all week when Doug was away. One day they will all be in online albums, but right now Doug is very busy with two different jobs. I worked on annotating Amelia's and Riku's part albums and went to bed at 11 P.M.</p>
