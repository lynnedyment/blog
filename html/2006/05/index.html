								<h2><a href="/2006/05/a_perfect_ocean_beach_day.html">A Perfect Ocean Beach Day</a></h2>
								<p>Doug went off to work today on the bus at 8:15; he is working in downtown SF all week, and our "internal" clocks went off just before 7 A.M. Laundry day today, and the ironing is building up again. Just don't feel like ironing lately. Wrote a few very long overdue emails to Carol Woods, and to Joe Price in the Manitoulin; nice to finally be catching up again. My goal is to have zero emails when I leave for Denver! </p>
<p>I tried to call Beth in her new home, but she was out; I did manage a great long talk with Uncle Frank. Virginia kindly emailed and told me they were home all morning; I caught Uncle Frank in the back yard strolling about. We made plans to book our flight from Denver home to the Falls around May 22nd. He sounded well if a little frustrated at what he sees as a lack of progress, but it was a big surgery and will take time. </p>
<p>Riku came bounding out of school with that big smile for me, and from the minute the car started moving, he just sang and sang. He started out with "The Farmer in the Dell" which is an obvious favourite right now; we sang away together and had a grand ol' time. Later on came "Old MacDonald"; he played for "ten minutes" and was sound asleep in less than that once we had read his story... a new book for him but an old one of his Daddy's... "Mr. Dressup, the Babysitter". Riku enjoyed it so much, and had lots of questions about the problems with having a baby elephant in a house!  </p>
<p>Bryn IM-ed me while Riku was napping, and told me that Riku has just started substituting sea creatures for the farm animals. I learned that the jelly fish is "sting sting here", "bite bite" for the shark, "blow blow" for the whale, and so on. He started singing these just as we were pulling into the driveway, although this time the whale was "splash splash here... ". This little boy loves to sing; it is the sweetest thing to just hear him singing away on his own, starting up a new song as soon as he finished off the last. A popular one right now is the beginning of a nursery song Akane sings to Mirei, but which Riku finishes off with part of an Ultraman song, his Japanese action hero figure. </p>
<p>Riku napped for an hour and a half, as did Amelia! Susan called just as Riku woke and suggested a trip to Ocean Beach. I quickly packed up a snack, and off we went at 4 P.M. Traffic was light, and we pulled into the parking lot twenty-five minutes later. Amelia and Susan were waiting for us, and the children had a grand time, right up to 6:10. Riku wanted to dig a big hole, and we did so, and then Amelia wanted to take one of his big plastic trucks to the water. Instead she ran at full speed pushing it ahead of her; considering she had to bend way over to do so, she was just amazing, not even tripping once. Heads were turning as it was the cutest thing to see. </p>
<p>Riku and I had decided not to carry a truck along with us, and even though he might have enjoyed pushing it along, he had lots of fun chasing after Amelia and inspecting the tire treads in the sand from the emergency beach vehicle. Amelia went a long way down the beach and Riku was determined to stop and do a thorough inspection every few feet, so it took a long time to get back to our blanket. I took lots of great photos of the two of them, and of Susan and Amelia playing in the water towards the end.</p>
<p>Riku decided he wanted a tub before he ate, which worked out well. I made him a veggie-loaded noodle soup, he drank lots of soy milk, and we all ate together when Doug got home.</p>
<p>Riku had gone to the bathroom just before his tub, and of course flushed the toilet as he always does. I was in the bathroom with him and he looked at me and said "Nana, say this: Oh, I wanted to do that!" Of course I repeated it right back to him and his reply was "Oh, too bad, you were too slow!" It was hilarious; he is already setting me up to be his straight man!</p>
<p>Bryn came by at 8:15, just as we had decided he wasn't coming; I had told Riku his daddy would be there, and it was good to see him walk in. Of course that meant getting out of bed and waving goodbye to him and to Brent, both off to play ping pong. Riku laughed as his daddy stuck his head out of sunroof (and Brent his hand), before pulling away.</p>
<p>We read the new book again tonight, and even though Riku was tired he had a few problems getting to sleep. First he needed water (I always forget to take it in with me) and then when he was almost asleep he had something bothering his eye. He started to cry a bit, as he said it was "picking" him. I got a cold cloth and he rubbed away at it, but even when trying to settle down again he kept reaching up to rub again. And his little dry spot on his ankle was bothering him... finally asleep at 9 P.M.  </p>
<p>I was too tired for a movie tonight, so went through 300 photos with Doug, managing to get them down to 100. I took so many today but of course had been taking photos all week when Doug was away. One day they will all be in online albums, but right now Doug is very busy with two different jobs. I worked on annotating Amelia's and Riku's part albums and went to bed at 11 P.M.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/05/a_boy_and_a_blue_bow.html">A Boy... and a Blue Bow...</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 7 A.M. today, convincing me to stay in bed with him so we could snuggle and hide under the covers. Mouse and Skippy the dog hid too, as we could hear Grandpa come down the stairs. Riku had his finger to his lips, and the animals kept perfectly quiet, but Riku's giggling drew Doug to the room, where he whipped off the covers and discovered us!</p>
<p>We only had an hour before he was picked up for school, but we packed a lot into that time... more hiding, apples and strawberries as he drew, and play time with both his Easter containers. He loves to open all the plastic eggs and rediscover what is in them; today the blue silly putty was a hit. At one point, he asked me for his new placemat and the pinwheel; I wondered why he wanted both, but soon found him on the chesterfield with the same items in the green plastic pail, as were in on Easter morning (two stuffed toys and a few candies), and the basket filled with the chocolate and plastic eggs. What a memory he has! </p>
<p>Riku asks lately "So, what are we doing today Nana?" This must come from Bryn, filling him in on school days or weekends. I told him that his dad was picking him up for school and that his dad was picking him up after lunch too. He knew that Amelia would be here for her nap and that maybe we would meet after his nap. I remember Taryn Speirs wanting to know all the details of her day at this age, though not all children do... interesting that Riku does as well.</p>
<p>After eating a great breakfast... hot cereal with mixed fruit, and a half slice of Doug's special apple-cinnamon bread, we spent some time "hiding" in dark places so he could use the tiger flashlight Gail and Tom gave him for his birthday. He loves to pretend there is something scary in the space (the storage room today) and then "discover" that it in only a light fixture instead. Today, however, he took it one step further and first pretended it was a bat, and we had to scurry on out of there really fast.</p>
<p>At one point this morning Riku said "Buenos dios, Nana". He said this yesterday in the car too; apparently his daddy is teaching a bit of a third language too.</p>
<p>Doug left for work downtown on the 8:15 bus again today. Looks like another gorgeous day out there.</p>
<p>Bryn picked Riku up right at 8:35, after I promised him I wouldn't put anything away upstairs in our bedroom. He was working hard on a structure when Bryn pulled up. He had a "special present" for Riku, which he told him about on the phone, so Riku was keen to go down to the car and check it out... a long plastic handle with a "pincher" on the end of it. Grinning from ear to ear he happily waved me goodbye.</p>
<p>I puttered away the morning, as is so easy for me to do... emails, tidying, and folding the last bit of laundry, eating, etc. and left the house at 12:10 to pick up Amelia. She looked like spring this afternoon in a sweet pair of pastel-striped overalls, a soft white long sleeved T-shirt and with the perkiest and prettiest of blue bows in her little "whale spout". Susan ties the tidiest of bows. I had sung "Farmer in the Dell" to her on Friday morning, and on the way home she started singing bits of it to me. I'm sure she will know it all the way through on her own in no time at all.</p>
<p>After ten minutes of drawing time with the timer running, Amelia decided she was hungry after all. Funny how this happens when bedtime is announced! :)  With Riku, it is always a drink. However, despite having a good lunch of chicken noodle soup at school, she did eat an entire container of yogurt, which will hold her nicely through her nap. I read the Mr. Dressup book to her, as I had told her a bit about the story on the way home from school. She dropped off before I finished singing our three familiar songs and slept from 1:30- 3:15, a nice long nap for her here.</p>
<p>I made tea and popcorn, and we went upstairs so Amelia could ride the train again. She had a real blanket for her "babies" today, the pair of stuffed snowman dolls, and cooed away at them... "There you go baby, all nice and cozy" and "Have a good nap, we're going for a train ride now" while tucking them snugly into the caboose. I read while she rode and we chatted back and forth about noises from the house renovating going on next door... they make Amelia nervous, and she would jump up on the bed with the caboose each time she heard some strange noise. It turned out that the noise we were hearing was a signal from the train letting us know that it was still turned on! </p>
<p>At one point, while Amelia was on the train, humming away busily to herself, I asked her "How are you doing, Miss Conductor?" Amelia turned to me very solemnly and responded "I am not a conductor; I am a mommy." </p>
<p>Later, as I was going down the stairs with my arms full of purse, hat, jacket, keys, and garage opener, Amelia looked up at me and said in her very serious Amelia tone of voice "Be very careful Nana; stairs are very dangerous." I was very careful.</p>
<p>At 4 P.M. we headed for the playground; it was a perfectly sunny day with just enough breeze so that it wasn't too hot there. We sat in both sandboxes for the longest time, and then Susan arrived, and then Akane with Riku and Mirei too! What a treat to see them walk in the gate; Riku hadn't napped, unfortunately, so was a little grumbly but mostly okay. He was happy playing with Amelia and Alexander in the sandbox for a bit and then he went off on his own while they both climbed the dome of rope ladders. Amelia is as comfortable as can be, climbing higher and higher; it makes me nervous to watch her, so Susan came and took over. Alexander, the little boy from Amelia's nursery school got to the top too, but was a little leery of climbing down. He did it though...</p>
<p>Riku and I stayed until 6:15, and then I drove him home; Akane had walked home a half hour earlier with Mirei. Bryn told me Riku was a little sad when I wasn't there to pick him up after school; I assured him tonight that I would be there tomorrow. He blew kisses and went upstairs happily with Akane and Mirei, who had come down to meet us at the door.</p>
<p>Susan wrote to say they stayed at the park until 6:40, and that Amelia had had a great time with Alexander; she sent a sweet photo of the two of them sitting together in his stroller.</p>
<p>Watched a taped show while eating a bowl of fruit, and then watched a movie with Doug from 8-10 P.M. Kelly is off to Savannah, Georgia tomorrow morning with Gregg; sent her an email, and answered a couple of others before heading off with the gift of a new book from Susan! Lucky me...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/05/ahhhhh.html">Ahhhhh!</a></h2>
								<p>I had booked a massage for this morning at 10 A.M., with Tricia, the most wonderful massage therapist at the Kabuki Spa. This was a combined Christmas gift from Kelly, Gregg, and Doug. It was a great massage and I was relieved to hear from her that I have very tight muscles in my side waist area; it's not a kidney problem as I have suspected. And it makes sense as I often carry the children with that hip jutting out; must learn not to do that and to get back to my stretching exercises too. She did a great job with me, and I was a mere puddle walking into the bath area; I soaked in the hot water twice, did a nice salt scrub in the steam room after I had lain there for twenty minutes, and had a leisurely sit in the sauna while I conditioned my hair. All in all, it was just what I needed... </p>
<p>I picked Riku up at 1 P.M. and we ran into Sophia's mom for the first time; I told her Riku quite liked Sophia, and she said that perhaps he could come over to play one day. I knew Riku was a very tired boy when he instantly said, "I don't want to do that"; even when we reassured him it wasn't to be today, he emphasized very clearly that he wasn't interested. He drank all his soy milk, was very quiet, and I really had to work at keeping him awake. Poor little guy; those eyes were so heavy and he finally just gave into it, just as I reached the garage door! I carried him upstairs, undressed him, sat him on the toilet and lay him down. By this time he was awake enough that he wanted a story; a very abridged version of "Love you Forever" was just fine. Riku was asleep within two minutes of lying down. </p>
<p>I ate some lovely fruity bread I had picked up at the bakery near the school, made some tea, and answered a few emails. Riku slept for just over two hours, although wakened twice very briefly. He was still not himself when he woke; usually he is ready with a big giggle within minutes of waking, wanting to snuggle first, but today he didn't want to do anything... no play-doh, no magnets, no painting, no building, no playground. He was happy lying in my arms, covered up with his spotted blanket, so I finally suggested going upstairs and watching Pingu. </p>
<p>He sat on the stairs waiting for me to make a snack for us; normally he would have gone up to wait, and played until I got there. He had some veggie & noodle soup, strawberries, and a half slice of Grandpa's special bread. He was a hungry boy, even though he had eaten all his lunch. Instead of Pingu he decided to watch "Curious George", a tape he hadn't seen before from Bryn and Caillie. It was just what he needed; we sat side by side, and before long he was laughing out loud at George's mischievous behavior and chatting away happily. </p>
<p>I ran down at one point to put some laundry in the dryer, and as I left Riku called out "Oh, come back! Keep me company or I will be lonely." I assured him I would be just a minute and kept my promise. He was playing with the blocks and farm animals by this time, and we recreated "The Farmer in the Dell" using many of the plastic and wooden human and animal figurines. Too bad we don't have a mouse and some cheese, but we pretended and had them all fall down at the end. Lots of fun. </p>
<p>We ended our day together by going outside with the chalk to wait for his dad to pick him up. The nice man with the little dog we see frequently on our street came by to say hello; Riku pointed out the sign for the lost cat and they talked about that, and then Riku let his dog sniff his hand. Riku knows how to carry on a conversation, and will initiate one with strangers. They waved goodbye to each other and Riku said as he left, "See you another day!" </p>
<p>Bryn pulled up about fifteen minutes later, with an almost asleep but still smiling Mirei in the back seat. She and her mom had been at the studio all day, and Bryn had dropped Akane off at home. Riku was happy to see Mirei and took her hand as soon as he was in his own car seat. </p>
<p>I had made cauliflower soup for dinner, and it was ready as Doug walked in the door. We've lost our warm weather; it was foggy all morning and quite cloudy all afternoon, although the sun peeked out for a bit in the late afternoon. I'm so glad we took advantage of the beach weather and went! </p>
<p>Read through a magazine after dinner, and then got busy cleaning all the kitchen counters thoroughly; the house next door is under construction and things are dustier than usual. Too tired to watch a movie tonight, and was pleased to get something accomplished today.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/05/an_amelia_afternoon.html">An Amelia Afternoon...</a></h2>
								<p>I slept in until 8 A.M. today, much to my surprise. Doug headed off for the bus soon after that, I answered a few emails, and then called Judi Speirs for a long chat. She is off to Spain and Greece with Brooke in a few weeks; we caught up on lots of news but really need some one-on-one time to really catch up. We're hoping that might be in July. </p>
<p>Off to pick Amelia up at 12:20. She was disappointed it wasn't her mommy there to meet her, but was soon planning which "babies" she would sleep with for her nap. I knew she hadn't slept well yesterday afternoon or last night, and the teacher confirmed she was tired, so it was no surprise that she was asleep before I finished the first song. We did read two short books, "I Am a Bear" and "I Am a Mouse" though... it's a given. </p>
<p>Amelia slept for an hour and a half. I made a big bowl of miso soup with some veggies and tofu added to it, and sat going through a magazine while I ate. </p>
<p>Kelly IM'd from Savannah, Georgia while I was picking up Amelia. She and Gregg are there on a five-day trip she earned from Creative Memories. Kelly had just finished with the only training session of the trip, and she and Gregg were heading for the ocean in just a few minutes; she said it was hot hot hot there! </p>
<p>When Amelia woke I asked her if she would like a snack. With no hesitation at all she said "I would like a sausage" and told me cream cheese on toast when I offered her toast with that or butter. This girl knows what she wants. She made me laugh out loud when I agreed to go upstairs with her so she could give her babies a train ride; she looked at me and said "Nana, make some popcorn and tea and we will go up." This is just what I did on Tuesday afternoon with her! Doug always says she has a mind like a steel trap and I agree with him. Before we went upstairs though, Amelia did some finger painting and made three drawings, each designated: one for her mommy, one for her daddy, and one for me. Today she told me she had a very nice mommy, and a very nice daddy, and I was very nice too.  :) </p>
<p>She blesses me when I cough or sneeze, says "I see, Nana" after asking a question and being given an answer, but mostly she just has a certain grown up little attitude in the way she asks and answers questions. It's really adorable. This is a little girl who is very sweet with her babies too. After carefully tucking them in under the  pink heart blanket she uses here, she noticed one of them had his foot out. She immediately said "Oh, look, his foot is sticking out; it will get cold. I will cover him up." Murmuring away, she did just that. What a mom! </p>
<p>We sat upstairs and read about five books, including "A Big Ball of String" and a pop-up book, which she and Riku still enjoy very much. Amelia chose the first two and I chose the next three or four. Once they were done, and we had both finished our snacks, we were ready to head off to the park. </p>
<p>At 4 P.M. we were off to the playground; the sun had come up and the playground was busy! Just as we pulled up, Alexander, a special friend of Amelia's, was there in his stroller with his mom, Susan. They were delighted to see each other and went running off. Susan and I followed them about, both a little nervous about having them climbing so high on the rope dome, but of course they did it successfully, and were off to something else. </p>
<p>We had a nice chat together while they were busy with sand toys and the climbing structure. She has invited me to Alexander's third birthday party on Sunday at noon. Doug will be in Boston, but Susan and Amelia will of course be there, so I may join them for an hour. They're just a few blocks away from us. </p>
<p>Susan soon joined us, bringing me ribbon wrapped Canadian chocolate bars and Smarties for a little treat. Doug was very happy to see them when he got home! </p>
<p>Kelly had left another little message for me, saying they had a great day at the seaside, and were just back at 5 P.M. with a nice terry blue CM jacket for Kelly and a sage green non-CM sweatshirt for Gregg. They were going to meet "the gang" in half an hour in the hot tub. Sounds as though they are having a great time; what a wonderful trip this is for them. </p>
<p>Jody had called while I was out, so at 6 P.M. I called her and we chatted for twenty minutes or so. Her B&B is booking up nicely with rooms already reserved into September. I hope to see her in July as well, if Doug isn't fully booked with classes that month. </p>
<p>I also called Riku to say goodnight; he told me he was eating dinner... kabocha, carrots, rice, some noodles, and water. When I told him I would see him tomorrow and said I loved him, he ended the call by saying, "I love you very much too; see you tomorrow." ... and ending it with an over-the-phone kiss. </p>
<p>Bryn had tucked him in at home, after picking him up at 1 P.M., and it sounded as though that had gone successfully.  </p>
<p>I had arranged to pick Doug up at 7:10, after his T'ai Chi class, rather than have him deal with another night of waiting for the bus; it took him forty-five minutes of standing last night which meant a short evening at home. Tonight we also dashed to Trader Joe's for a few grocery items, had an Italian dinner at "Roccos", the place we ate brunch on Sunday. The food was fine, but a little salty and overpriced for what we had, and Safeway was our last stop on the way home. </p>
<p>Virginia wrote to say that Uncle Frank had had a very good day... another hour at Barnes and Noble, and despite a little pain was feeling well and was stronger. So good to hear... </p>
<p>We watched a taped TV show, Doug did his monthly invoice for work, I answered a few emails, and am ready to turn in, and read my new book from Susan. </p>
<p>Woke with a sore throat yesterday morning, it went away during the day, came back last night, and repeated the same thing today... arggh! Gargling with salt water and hoping to chase the bugs away.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/05/happy_birthday_gram_day_and_ri.html">Happy Birthday, Gram day.... and Riku too!</a></h2>
								<p>My morning disappeared in no time today... Skyped with Kelly first, who called me from Savannah, Georgia. She was on her way to soak in the hot tub and sauna before having a 70-minute river rock massage. She had already run for four miles, and Gregg had brought some fruit and a little quiche up to the room for her breakfast. Meanwhile, Gregg was already at his cooking class, so Kelly dashed off, promising to call later and fill me in on how the massage was. </p>
<p>Then I phoned Beth and we talked about her big beautiful new house; she is delighted with it, loving the quiet surroundings and all the trees and space around her. She and Paul are pretty well unpacked and organized, except for purchasing two wardrobes for their closetless bedroom, the kitchen is set up, and she is looking forward to opening the pool at the end of the month. </p>
<p>Next on my phone list was Uncle Frank; Virginia answered and said they were just sitting in the kitchen having tea on an overcast morning. It was overcast here as well, so we had a nice long chat about "The Da Vinci Code", which UF is just six pages from finishing, and talked more about when he might be given permission to fly home. </p>
<p>I just had time to shower, Skype with Gail for a bit about photos, grab a quick breakfast, and dash out the door to meet Riku. As always, Riku just comes bursting out of the room and up the few stairs, with his big welcoming smile, but this time wearing a tri-cornered paper hat, threatening to fall off at any second, which it did, several times, and carrying a bright and beautifully coloured fish flag with a twirling gold top on it. He insisted on having both in the back seat with him, and it was quite a struggle to manage it all and drink his soy milk as well. </p>
<p>However, once that was done, he had such a hard time keeping his eyes open. He lost the battle on Potrero Avenue, and I had to carry a very sleepy boy up the stairs and straight into bed. He was chilly as I stripped him down for his nap (he gets too hot with more than just his underwear on), so cuddled him into the soft pink heart blanket I had bought for Mirei. Amelia loved it yesterday too, so it will be well worn in by the time Mirei uses it. </p>
<p>Riku napped for two hours... was asleep by 1:40 and struggling to awaken at the end of that two hours. He awoke with a dream, I think, and a hard cry at the end of the first hour, and would happily have gone back to sleep with any encouragement after two. However, I try very hard to not disrupt his night routine, so cuddled him for the longest time, slowly having him decide what he wanted to do with the rest of his time here. </p>
<p>It was still cool and overcast, he was hungry, so I prepared a big snack, and we went upstairs to watch a short but sweet new video for him, one of Bryn's and Caillie's. It is called "Old Bear", and has animated soft animals with British accents. Riku was enchanted and smiled away as he watched it with me. He had some of Grandpa's "special" toast (cinnamon and apple), a half portion of cereal, and strawberries, orange segments, and a half of my banana! </p>
<p>As soon as that was over, in just a half hour, we sat and built with Lego, mostly playing with the farm. He sat on the train for a bit too, although he doesn't use it very often. Today it was appealing to him and he took his toys for a ride in the caboose. That's where he was when Bryn walked in to pick him up. After a bit he had Bryn close his eyes so he could show him the hat and fish flag... too cute. Oh, Riku also took a photo of me wearing the hat too; he was delighted to see the results. </p>
<p>They went off home for dinner, just as Kelly called to let me know she had enjoyed the massage but wouldn't likely choose to have another. Next up for them is a cruise up the river to a Crab Shack for dinner. </p>
<p>I answered a few emails before Doug came in from work. We had small bowls of chili and took them upstairs to eat with some tortilla chips, while watching a British Masterpiece Theatre taped film. We both really enjoyed "Carrie's War", a story of a young brother and sister evacuated out of London during the Blitz. </p>
<p>We both answered emails for a while and ended the evening with a taped TV show; we're trying to get caught up before I leave for Ontario, but it's a challenge with Doug away so much lately as well. </p>
<p>I always think I will get to bed earlier for some reading time, but tonight didn't turn the light out until 12:45. Doug gave in before I did; he has T'ai Chi in the morning and so had an excuse for turning in earlier. </p>
<p>Gram would have been 106 today! How I miss her in my life...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/05/the_weekends_coming_up.html">The Weekend's Coming Up!</a></h2>
								<p>Ah, the luxury of just rolling over and going back to sleep. I did it again today, burrowing under the duvet, blocking out the sunshine, in order to have seven hours sleep under my belt today. Eight A.M. is usually late for me, but I wasn't about to get out of bed at my usual 6:30 this morning! </p>
<p>I spent three hours sitting at the computer, dashing off emails as quickly as they came in, Skyping with Kelly, and IMing with Bryn and Kelly. Finally, at 11 A.M. I dashed up to shower, ate my breakfast, read the paper, and prepared both snacks and a mid-afternoon mini-meal for Riku, in case we have some beach time after his dermatology appointment. </p>
<p>I was at his school right at 12:30, a half hour early, to make sure he had enough of a nap that the appointment would not be difficult for him. A happy boy came running to the door, carrying the sweetest Mothers' Day calendar for his mom. He had drawn the face on and did an amazing job, with two eyes, a smile, and straight black but short hair. Bryn told me later that when he dropped him off this morning it was hanging on the wall along with all the others and two mothers told him he had to look at Riku's as it was so amazing! </p>
<p>He was asleep by 12:45, and I drove right to Ocean Beach; he didn't budge, and slept soundly while I read more of the book Susan gave me last week: "To Hell with All That" by Caitlin Flanagan. Susan introduced me to her writing, and saves any columns she comes across for me. It's non-fiction... witty, interesting, and well-written. It was sheer bliss to sit and watch the waves roll in, with the sun shining and enough of a breeze to keep it comfortable. </p>
<p>At 2 o'clock I left the beach and headed for Divisidero Street, finding a free parking spot in the shade. Riku had to be gently roused at 2:40 (the appointment was at 2:30 but I had phoned and found out we had a half hour grace period), and I carried a still dozy little fellow to the building. At that point though, he was just fine; pushed the button for the elevator, chatted with the man inside sharing the ride with us, showing him the sore spot on his wrist. Guess he was practicing for what he was going to show the doctor. </p>
<p>Bryn must have been talking about the visit, as Riku said he was going to see a "super doctor" and she was going to give him "super cream". Riku has two eczema spots that just won't stay healed; one on the inside of his right wrist, and one on the front of his right ankle. The little joining spots near Riku's earlobes are an occasional problem, as well as the occasional break-outs on his arms, legs, and buttocks. It is 99% better since he was a very young baby, but we would all like to see it gone once and for all! </p>
<p>Riku was measured and weighed before the doctor saw him; he is an "old pro", the assistant told him, as he stood on the big scale and backed up against the ruler... 33 pounds and 37 inches. Dr. Seigal is a young doctor, and was very thoughtful with Riku. He showed her all his spots, and even pulled down his underwear so she could see a red spot that bothers him at times! He will be using a stronger cortisone cream on the bad spots which should clear it up, and lots of moisturizers to keep the rest of his skin looking good. </p>
<p>Riku continues to be so sociable with strangers when we are out together. He showed a woman in the waiting room his wrist and told her the doctor was going to give him special cream for it, and when he spotted a large baby in a back carrier in the waiting room he told the dad, "Oh, I have a baby like that at my home! But she is different. She is a girl baby and she is little." </p>
<p>On the way out, the elevator button wouldn't turn red when I pushed it. Riku thought it was broken but he pushed it twice, hard, so when it opened, he told the man already inside that he had "fixed the elevator" and continued the conversation all the way down to the lobby and to the door. He even asked the man, "What that green thing is in your mouth?" and when told it was gum, said "Oh, I see. Nana, that green thing is gum!" He waved goodbye to everyone he spoke to or passed on the street on the way back to the car. </p>
<p>We talked about which playground we would go to, and whether he wanted to go home or to the airport to pick Doug up. Of course he chose the latter. On the way there though he sang "The Farmer in the Dell" straight through and in tune, with little inflections making it sound ever so sweet. He does love to sing, that boy, and I must expand my repertoire of songs. There are so many I haven't sung to him or Amelia and they learn the new ones so quickly.</p>
<p>Off we went to the playground near his home; he ate two bananas (his and mine!) at the doctor's office, and then some banana bread in the car. He must be in a growth spurt right now, as I often find myself feeling like a mother bird, keeping him filled up at his request. "Do you have a snack?" or "I need a snack now" or "Do you have some soy milk?" </p>
<p>It was fairly quiet again today at the playgound, and Riku happily wandered about, with no sitting in the sandbox at all today. Lately he has been most happy climbing up on the playhouse structure with both hands filled with buckets, and various bits he has found in the rest of the playground... little scraps of paper, a plastic spoon, a special stone, sticks of course(!) and anything sparkly. Lately there seem to be colourful tiny plastic balls around the area, which are always a big hit. </p>
<p>We came home for an hour before heading off to the airport to pick up Doug. Riku watched a Pingu video, while I fed him some noodle and veggie soup and the rest of the yogurt he had started at the doctor's office. Interestingly, he insisted we watch the last episode that makes him a little nervous, the same one that his cousin Bryn didn't like either. It's a bad dream sequence and neither of them, nor Amelia, like the walrus with his big teeth. But he said we would watch it together and we decided again today that really he is just a funny guy, and not really scary. He wanted to know today though what a dream really was... and we talked about why his mom and dad were not in the dream with Pingu. </p>
<p>Just before drifting off to sleep on Monday night Riku asked me "What is a dream?" and I told him they were thoughts in his head, like a movie. I imagine more and more questions will come to him. </p>
<p>Doug's flight was due in a half hour later than scheduled, so at 6:45 we left for the airport. We were there for only a few minutes before Riku, crouching down and looking up the escalator, spotted his Grandpa. Well, the squeals and big smiles got him lots of big smiles from the assembled crowd, as he ran to give Doug a big hug. He and I had had fun on the moving sidewalk on the way in, walking backwards on it, and running carefully too. Grandpa pretended he was a big monster which was very exciting and we managed to escape! </p>
<p>Sure enough, on the way home Riku wanted more snacks; I had cut up a big navel orange just in case, so that went down well, but I didn't have the toast he requested, or the bagel with cream cheese either. I had had that with me earlier but hadn't anticipated him needing more after the big bowl of soup and the rest of the yogurt! Where <strong>is</strong> he putting it all? </p>
<p>Doug took Riku upstairs, with Riku all set to present his mommy with her card. Doug said Bryn answered the door, so Riku said "Happy Mothers' Day!" but went dashing off to give it to Akane in the kitchen when he realized that he had the wrong person! </p>
<p>Home to tidy up after the quick dash out of the house so early this afternoon... made a hot cup of tea, answered some emails, and will head up now to join Doug who is reading before he turns out the light. He's tired, having been up since 6:45 A.M. in New York and it now being 1:30 body time.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/05/mothers_day_and_flamenco.html">Mothers' Day and Flamenco!</a></h2>
								<p>This day started out in a very lazy fashion... sleeping in until 8 A.M. and then sitting in bed chatting with Kelly, who called just minutes after I awoke. </p>
<p>She is without her children today, as they are with Hans at his Mom's this weekend. So, instead she got up early with the dogs, went for a long run, and came home to a lovely breakast and card from Gregg. </p>
<p>My gift from Kelly was to be a long soak at the Kabuki but we talked about the new photo program from Creative Memories and I may get that instead.... Doug has no idea when I am going to find the time for yet another project but I'm an optimist! </p>
<p>I dashed into the shower immediately, but hadn't finished drying my hair when I heard a little tap on the bathroom door. There stood Riku with a <strong>huge</strong> bouquet of beautiful red tulips, eighteen in all! He said "Happy Mothers' Day!" and immediately dashed downstairs to start playing. </p>
<p>Akane, Bryn, and Mirei were here as well, and Bryn got started immediately on the fresh scones he had promised to make for breakfast. He also scrambled eggs and cooked bacon for Akane, Doug set the table, and I got to spend most of that time smiling at Mirei who was just beaming away in her usual fashion. We had stewed tomatoes, and veggie "bacon" and "sausage" too. The current scones were light and delicious, although Bryn says he will make them thicker the next time, and perhaps use a different recipe, since he thought they were lacking in what he thinks is a real scone flavour. </p>
<p>Susan called from the plane at 10:15 to say goodbye (Amelia said hello as well); they were preparing to take off fifteen minutes later for Vancouver, and then Vancouver Island. They will be with Susan's mom for Mothers' Day.</p>
<p>While breakfast was being prepared, Doug got on the net and booked Uncle Frank's and my flight from Denver to Toronto. I leave in two weeks exactly for Denver, and the following day we leave for the Falls. I am scheduled to return on the 28th of June. </p>
<p>The plan for today was for all of us to go to SFMOMA, but Riku had napped only twenty minutes yesterday and was in sore need of an early nap. I sent Bryn, Akane, and Mirei off to the gallery and Doug and I stayed home with Riku; he was asleep within minutes of being tucked in. </p>
<p>It was hot here today, the hottest day we have had so far, so Bryn and Akane returned here two hours later, just as Riku was wakening from his hour and a half nap. It's much cooler at our place than at theirs, so Bryn locked himself in the front bedroom to work, Akane started the laundry they brought over, and Riku played in the yard with the wheelbarrow, but running in and out to chat with us too. Mirei got some attention; I took lots of photos of her, and then she settled in to a nap in Riku's room. </p>
<p>The afternoon flew by and at 6:30 Doug and I set off for an evening of flamenco music and dance, a gift from our downstairs neighbour as thanks for babysitting their daughter Oona one evening many weeks ago. the first half was all singing, which dragged a little. It's hard for us to sit and listen to music, when we don't understand a word of what is being said (it being all in Spanish), but the second half was just wonderful. This was our first full exposure to flamenco (Doug had seen some at a folk festival years ago) but Karyn had arranged for front row seats for us, at at fairly small club, and it was terrific. I was quite amazed by the drama of it all, and the interaction between the dancers and the musicians. Apparently, in most cases, the audience takes more part in throwing out calls of "ole" too, but we were mostly an audience of gringos and not doing our part. The owner of the club is a woman in her fifties perhaps, and was just the most terrific dancer; she is in amazing physical shape and I am not surprised! She was breathing less hard than the two much younger women dancers and doing more intricate footwork too. </p>
<p>We were home at 9:30 P.M., did some emailing (I had so many emails in from friends today; it was lovely!), and I caught up on the Sunday paper. I was sleepy, but managed to stay awake and read until midnight, when I finally turned out the light on my side of the bed.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/05/and_another_week_begins.html">And Another Week Begins...</a></h2>
								<p>I slept until 8:35 this morning! I have no idea what is going on with my sleep pattern, but I have slept in later this week than the entire year put together. </p>
<p>I made up for lost time though, by getting the washing started immediately, answering lots of emails, and showering before finally sitting down to eat breakfast. Still, it seemed no time at all had passed before it was 12:40 and Doug and I were heading out the door to pick up Riku. </p>
<p>I assumed it was going to be as hot today as it was yesterday, but it was cool and foggy over on the other side of the city. Riku came bounding out of school wearing shorts and a short-sleeved shirt, which would be fine in Potrero Hill, and fine indoors at school too, but when we walked down to meet Grandpa at the bakery Riku cuddled into Doug's arms for the trip back to the car. </p>
<p>I took along the new book Doug had just given him yesterday, "No Cats Allowed", so that I could read to Riku and maybe keep him awake on the way home. Bryn thought he might be extra tired since the heat last night kept him awake longer than usual. He was just fine, however, and asked for ten minutes on the timer to play before we headed in for his nap. He even delayed a bit longer by telling me he had to finish his soy milk before he could nap... and his drawing wasn't finished either. </p>
<p>He napped for one and a half hours, still not quite ready to waken but not wanting to be left alone in bed either. However, I left the door open and told him he could sleep more or get up. This kept him in bed a bit longer but he finally just wanted me to snuggle with him and we giggled him awake slowly but surely. </p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon passed quickly. It was warm enough that he just wandered around in his underwear, indoors and out, busy with the wheelbarrow for a bit, and collecting rocks to fill it up. </p>
<p>Doug gave him an old digital camera which thrilled him to bits. It even has its own camera case! He went outside and snapped dozens of photos of spit bugs, a current fascination ("What is saliva?"), and took some indoor shots too. At one point he realized "it's not working!" as he couldn't see through the little screen and knows he should be able to. However, it wasn't a huge worry, and kept him busy for a long while. </p>
<p>I went upstairs to change the bedding, and after a bit Riku came up telling me, "I didn't know where you were. I was calling 'Nana, Nana', and you were not answering." After coming back downstairs he asked for the big and mostly ignored basket of toys from the laundry room, and spent the rest of the afternoon digging through it, rediscovering old treasures. </p>
<p>One of the things he found was a soft pre-dressed baby; he is such a good daddy, and carefully picked her up and insisted that Doug wait until he wrapped her in a "blanket"... a little jacket, before they went down to check on the mail. He lay her carefully on the floor beside him as he played with some other toys, but would look over at the doll occasionally, telling her "shhhh", and "It's okay; go to sleep." </p>
<p>Dinner time at 6 P.M. (we had salmon, new potatoes, broccoli, and steamed carrots) and Riku repeated after Doug at the end of the meal "What's forrrr dessert?". He and Bryn do this at home too; it's a Dyment ritual. I put out our special dessert bowls, from way back at the farm days in the 70s... bought at my first auction... filled with custard and strawberries. Those guys just polished them off in no time, as did Bryn with the bowl I put out for him, when he came to say goodnight to Riku. </p>
<p>Riku played with his animals in the tub, singing out in a loud voice "Old McDonald Had a Farm" as he lined them up along the edge. He also sang a Japanese song today at naptime, putting his index and thumbs together and then swinging his arms out and putting his hands under his armpits. It will be interesting to learn from Akane what the words mean. </p>
<p>Riku is like Caillie, and gets very warm as he settles into a sleep, so I ended up taking his undershirt off after he tossed and turned longer than usual. This did the trick and he was soon asleep, at 8:40 rather than the 8:10 I was aiming for. When he gets hot, he itches and so the scratching went on for a bit... </p>
<p>I'm expecting to be turning in shortly myself; it's 10:45 and no doubt Riku will be awake between 6:30 and 7 A.M. as usual.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/05/seven_days_to_denver.html">Seven Days To Denver!</a></h2>
								<p>Awoke this morning feeling like I'm getting down to the wire; only one week from today I shall be on my way to Denver. Hard to imagine! </p>
<p>I slept in again; how very strange this seems to me, as I never used to sleep much past 7 A.M. and lately it's been much later. I emerged at 8:30 again this morning. I guess I can get away with a late night now and then, but not these consistently late hours I've been keeping lately... and Doug too. </p>
<p>Of course this means I have less time to do the things I can only do in the mornings, so today is a catch up day for sure... or that was the plan. Bryn called to say that he had to be in the office all day today, and that Akane would be home alone with the children. I suggested that she walk over here at noon with them, and Riku could have his nap here. Doug is really busy with a deadline, and thought it would be best if Riku weren't here for quite such a long time, wanting some attention from him. So, plans changed and we were to meet in the playground instead; Riku could have some running around time, and I would drive over to pick him up for his nap. </p>
<p>Plans changed again. Mirei napped longer than was expected, so I walked over to Hampshire Street at 12:45, and Riku and I had a nice slow walk home, except when we were taking turns chasing each other, and running and hiding once we hit the condos with their convenient hiding places at the doors. It is such a joy to see Riku running again, without stopping to cough! It seems that is all behind us for good. </p>
<p>Riku wanted some playtime before his nap, and so I made him a snack of cheese bites, a half a slice of Grandpa's "special" toast (cinnamon and apple bread), and half of a banana with his vanilla soy milk to drink. He ate every bite, and downed the milk too, while I read him his newest book "The Little Engine Who Could". He liked it a lot and said "Oh, I remember this book! We didn't see it for a long time!" and now I'm wondering if we didn't need to order it, as perhaps Kelly and Bryn's old copy is around here somewhere. </p>
<p>Once Riku finished eating he said to me, "Riku is tired. I want to go to bed now." We read "Drummer Hoff", a short story and one of his Daddy's books, before I tucked him; he was sound asleep in just minutes, curled up with "Skippy". It had rained hard while he was eating, and I opened his window a bit to let that sound and moisture seep into the room. Riku napped for close to an hour and forty-five minutes, crying out just once in a dream "Don't come in here. Don't come in here!" </p>
<p>Riku loves to stay in bed and cuddle these days. I go in to him when he has awakened close to when he should be up anyway, turn off the sound machine and lie beside him, as he wraps his arms around my neck and pulls me in tight to him. I start to make quiet little murmuring sounds in his neck then; he burrows in deeper, but eventually comes out with some silliness, usually our pretend language. This never fails to make him laugh, and then we hid under his soft blue blanket, calling out loud enough for Doug to hear on the monitor to come and find us. Riku just cannot <strong>not</strong> giggle! It is so funny to lie there with his face right next to mine and see that face start to squint and curl up in delight, before the laughter comes bursting out. He shrieks every time Doug throws the cover off us... and then the pillow fight starts. What a guy!</p>
<p>Riku checked out a few bugs outside when he got up; not sure if he liked being out in the wet with his bare feet, especially when he saw some hardbacked bugs all gathered together. </p>
<p>Bryn said he would come by asap, so I took Riku his snack (a small bowl of porridge with almonds, and a whole orange in segments) upstairs, while we played with the blocks and made a train. Bryn came by to get him around 5 P.M. ("Don't put away these things, okay? Just leave them. I will be back.") and they left not much later for a trip to a computer store. </p>
<p>A funny thing happened when Bryn came upstairs to see us. It was obvious that Riku knew Bryn was standing behind him at the door, but he didn't look around. Bryn kept saying "Riku, look at me!" but with a smirk on his face, Riku just ignored him, concentrating, or at least pretending to, on his blocks. So Bryn came out with "Riku! Look at me! I have hair now!" and Riku whipped his head around so fast that Bryn said it was a good thing he wasn't wearing glasses, or they would hav flown off his face! It was very funny! </p>
<p>I managed to get all the laundry and ironing done today so no Monday wash day tomorrow...  </p>
<p>Beth's online! Yahoo! </p>
<p>I was really hungry today for some reason, so made a quick tomato sauce with some added homemade pesto, cooked up a generous portion of whole wheat pasta, made a simple salad and we were finished dinner at 6:15 tonight, much earlier than we've been eating lately. </p>
<p>Doug continued working and I went upstairs with my tea to finish off a  tape of Oprah shows... and I've been writing emails, completing blogs, and just realized that it's 1:20 A.M.! Off I go to bed as Doug expects he will be up until 3 a.m. perhaps, finishing up the latest teaching manual. </p>
<p>Night, night... and Happy Birthday Kimmie, who is 43 today!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/05/do_you_want_to_talk_about_drea.html">"Do You Want to Talk About Dreams?"</a></h2>
								<p>I turned off my reading light at 2 A.M. this morning and was awake at 7:45; I decided to get up and on with my day and go to bed early tonight. I'm on my way as soon as I write this. </p>
<p>Bryn IM'd this morning with news of Riku's night and morning; here is a little excerpt: </p>
<p>Bryn: this morning i asked riku where mirei and mommy were (i wstill in bed... he had been up and came back into his room to talk to me)</p>
<p>Riku: "mirei is in the big bed"... i asked, "sleeping?"... "no, she is awake"</p>
<p>Bryn: "and mommy?"</p>
<p>Riku:"mommy is VERY awake"</p>
<p>Bryn: he gets me to do push-ups in the morning now.</p>
<p>Doug and I picked Riku up at 1 P.M.; we read "The Three Pigs" on the way home and even though he had eaten all his lunch at school, drank a full container of vanilla soy milk on the way home, just as I was about to tuck him in... the timer had already gone off, he told me he was hungry. Talk about a well-timed delaying tactic but he was hungry indeed; he had six small pieces of cheese, a half slice of Doug's cinnamon/apple bread, and another very small cup of soy milk. I can see his face getting more round by the day! </p>
<p>It was a good thing Bryn had mentioned the push-ups to me as, just as Riku was settling in for his nap, he piped up with "Oh, I forgot to do my pushups!" I reassured him he could do them after his nap. </p>
<p>Riku's day in a nutshell... nice nap, with some pillow "fighting" before he got out of bed. Then he dragged out the wooden blocks from under the bed, that used to be his Grandpa's and then his aunt's and dad's, and we sat on the floor of the living room for the longest time. Riku built a very impressive city and playground and I built a sandbox for it. Riku put little wooden knobs for people... Auntie Susan and I sat on the bench while he, Amelia, and Diego sat in the sandbox. </p>
<p>I did some video recording of him sitting there, busy with his town; I really wanted to catch him chatting away to himself as he built, but he engaged me in his conversation and somehow got on the topic of policemen and bad guys. I don't do enough recording of any of the children and must do so. </p>
<p>He swept in the garden for a while and carried more stones to his wheelbarrow, he had a nice big dinner of spaghetti with three veggies, followed by a long tub time. Bryn and Brent came in just as I had taken him out of the tub. He had a little time with Brent while Doug and Bryn chatted for a few minutes and then we went back to building. </p>
<p>Riku is very clear these days about wanting his current projects left just as they are. "Don't put these away, okay?" and "Leave those right there; I will play with them next time!"  and once I had "You promise?" with those eyebrows raised as he said it. </p>
<p>Before going to bed, he watched the video I took of Mirei on Saturday and the footage of him today. He laughed so hard when he saw Mirei batting away at her toys; her arms were actually blurry as she was moving so quickly, and of course he was quite intrigued to see himself too.  </p>
<p>He took a while to fall asleep tonight; seemed to be settling nicely and then would pop up with a question, just as I was thinking I could leave the room. "What was that funny noise?", and "Tomorrow Daddy is picking me up?", and the best of all "Do you want to talk about dreams?" No, thank you, I would like your little mind to stop turning and go to sleep. </p>
<p>Oh, one other funny thing that happened was that I got a serious stitch in my side as I was lying beside Riku settling him in for the night. He heard me gasp although I was trying hard not to make any noise at all; however, I guess he could sense all was not well, so he asked in the most concerned voice "Are you okay, Nana?" I told him I really really hurt and he immediately said "Would you like me to get some ice? That will make it feel better." It was so sweet, and I told him I would be fine. He rolled over and put his hand on my neck and said "It will be okay, Nana. It will be okay."... and after a few deep breaths it was. I thought there thinking what a wonderful doctor our little "Dr. Dyment" is with his kind and concerned bedside manner. </p>
<p>I tidied up, answered lots of emails, wrote my blog, and went off to bed at 10:45, expecting that my day will start around 6:30 A.M.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/05/be_careful_with_that_hot_tea_n.html">"Be Careful With That Hot Tea, Nana!"</a></h2>
								<p>Yes, Amelia's home! She and Susan arrived back from their eight day trip to Vancouver Island and Vancouver late last night. I wasn't sure if Amelia would be going to her nursery school this morning or not, but phoned last night, letting her parents know that I was looking forward to our regular Tuesday afternoon together. </p>
<p>Riku was indeed awake right on the nose at 6:30 this morning. We stayed in bed until 7 A.M., snuggling, hiding under the covers, pretending there were monsters "out there!", and cuddling some more. Riku always starts our day together by whispering our "nonsense" language softly near my face; it makes me smile every time, and he laughs when I come right back at him with the same. </p>
<p>He had some apple slices while sitting on Doug's lap watching the videos I took yesterday. I dashed upstairs to shower while they were busy with that, and then made Riku a big bowl of oatmeal with almonds and blueberries. Doug had made himself toast soon after and of course Riku wanted some. He ate a half a slice along with a full orange while he played with his big basket of toys set beside his "desk". I cannot believe how much he eats, now that he is really well. </p>
<p>We were organized enough this morning that Riku had some time in the back yard to water the garden with his little watering can, load more stones in the wheelbarrow, and do a little drawing with chalk at the front of the house before Bryn arrived for him. </p>
<p>Doug and I were both busy at the computers, but dashed off to San Mateo to pick up a free Graco booster seat which Amelia and Riku will be able to use once they reach 40 pounds and a certain height as well. I'm liking this freecycle group I joined last week, managing to donate a pair of shoes to someone who wears exactly the same size. </p>
<p>Amelia was all smiles when I picked her up from school; I got a nice big hug. And then the funniest thing happened... all the children were sitting at the table when I arrived, and as soon as the teacher left that area to get Amelia's sweater the children all started making a lot of noise. Amelia's first thought was that they were protesting that she was leaving so she walked over and announced, "It's okay children; I will be back another day" and as we went out the door she said to me, "Those children are very sad because I am leaving." </p>
<p>Amelia has a cold and a bad cough; poor wee boo. She coughed and coughed all the way home and was ready for bed as soon as she had a big drink of water. Doug had bought a children's book for her about the Sylvia Hotel where she and her mom always stay when in Vancouver; it's about a cat who moves in from the beach, and even though Amelia listened to each page, those little eyes were drooping. </p>
<p>I had the monitor on and Doug was amazed that she wasn't waking with each hard cough we heard; finally. after a half hour, she did awaken. I went in and lay with her for fifteen minutes, stroking her forehead and doing her pressure points as well. She was making little murmuring sounds and was soon asleep again, but twenty minutes later, at the hour mark exactly, she awoke and told me she was ready to get up. </p>
<p>We spent most of our time upstairs in the bedroom, as she wanted to ride the train with her babies... the snowmen she had taken up with before she went away. She had slept with the baby, and then we joined the mommy snowperson upstairs. Grandpa had to go up and put the train together but alas, the battery needed recharging. While they were busy with that, I made tea and took Amelia some yogurt upstairs. She was waiting at the top of the stairs for me, and as I started up, with my very full cup, Amelia said "Be careful with that hot tea, Nana!" I was, but she watched me the whole way up and to the bedroom. Since a train ride wasn't a possibility for the babies, instead we dressed and undressed them (I had put aside some wee socks and nighties for the dolls last weekend) and watched a "Little Bears" video of Bryn's and Caillie's. Amelia was sniffling away and coming over for periodic nose blowings. </p>
<p>At 3:30 we got ready for the playground; I had come across a sweet flowered denim vest of Caillie's and Amelia wore that on top of her pink top and striped pants. She looked adorable and the temperature was just perfect for the outfit; the sun was out and it was lovely, with a little breeze. </p>
<p>We had such a good time at the playground; she pushed me on the turnabout when we had a chance on it on our own. I sat on the edge with my feet up and Amelia really pushed to get me started. She reminded me to "hold on with two hands, Nana", and said it very seriously too ... such a little mother she is! I could tell she wasn't feeling quite up to par as she spent more time in the sandbox than usual, but had a little climbing time towards the end of our visit there. </p>
<p>Susan came by to pick her up at 5:15 or so, bearing gifts of course! I have two "Tea at the Empress" tins of tea and Bruni kindly tracked down some wool I really liked.. Susan brought back five big skeins of it for me... a lovely dark rich blue which is perfect with my winter coat. </p>
<p>Doug home from T'ai Chi bearing burritos, so we're off to watch a rented movie... more emailing later, no doubt, and bed... at the end of a busy and lovely afternoon with Amelia.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/05/the_everyday_story_book.html">"The Everyday Story Book"</a></h2>
								<p>In June 1951, at the end of grade one, I won the reading award, given to the best reader in the grade. My prize was a book, which I dearly loved, called "The Everyday Story Book". It contains seven stories, one for each day of the week. Somehow, it managed to survive a household with ten children growing up in it! It had been dribbled on, scribbled in, and, in my own grade one printing, I had written in protest on one of the pages, "do not skribble in this book." You can still see it but I'm so glad I wrote it in pencil!  </p>
<p>I also underlined what I thought were some obviously disturbing (to me) sentences in one of the stories... about Jiggers, a little dog who gets locked into a house on his own. I underlined "The house was cold", "There was no fire", and "There was no one to feed him or give him a drink". I think this is my very favourite story of all. Throughout the pages you can see where various brothers and sisters took their pencils to the book too. </p>
<p>The book was in bad shape after all those years; the front cover had come off, the last page of the last story was torn, the title page was torn in half, and the certificate that announced my award was still there, amazingly enough, on the torn page. </p>
<p>One of the best presents I ever received was given to me about six years ago. Kelly, unbeknownst to me on one of her visits to San Francisco, had taken the book home with her. I had been reading it to  Bryn and Caillie, just as I read it to their Mom and Uncle Bryn many years ago, and to the children I babysat in Vancouver. </p>
<p>For my birthday that year, Kelly had arranged to have it completely redone for me. It sports a new binding, reinforced corners, two dark green double pages at the front (with two small pictures from the torn page permanently attached to them), and a fine job of a special transparent material covering the torn page. It was such a thoughtful and priceless gift to me; it meant a lot to me and reminded me of how much I love to read, and from such an early age. </p>
<p>Riku and Amelia both love being read to, and each chooses two stories at nap time, as well as any time throughout their visits with me. We have a lot of books in the house for them; I often read the same stories over and over, and then they get put aside for a while, until we rediscover them. However, last week I thought of this special book, and this morning came across it as I was tidying up the front bedroom. I took it with me for the car ride home from school with Riku.</p>
<p>While Doug picked up two slices of wonderful "designer" style pizza for us (Wednesdays was made with thin potato slices, grilled red onions, and pesto sauce... it was sooo good; today was grilled kabocha squash, red onion, garlic oil, and fontina cheese), Riku chose two stories to read, and another when we got home. He liked the stories and the pictures, just as I knew he would.</p>
<p>I shall name all seven stories, as I know my younger siblings will remember them well too. They start with "Sally's Lost Shoe", "A New Pet", "Jiggers" (my favourite), Teddy's Sailboat", "The Make-Believe Picnic", "The Lost Teddy Bear", and finally "Mumpsy Goes to Kindergarten".  </p>
<p>Riku was a tired fellow at pick-up, happy, but he didn't come running out with his usual big smile today, and as soon as we pulled into the driveway he said "I want to go to sleep right now." We read one more story, and he was asleep before I got to "the babies on the bus... ", less than five minutes from tuck-in to door shut. </p>
<p>He was groggy and pale after two solid hours of sleep; he awoke slowly, wanting to be in my arms and snuggling for the longest time. He would have gone back to sleep with no problem at all, but it was 4 P.M. when he awoke and that was late enough. His skin was itchy too, with fine bumps on his back, tummy, and arms. I tried to talk him into a tub so that he could relax and then I could get some cream on him. Usually he's up for this, but not today. </p>
<p>It was warm outside but the wind was blowing hard. Riku was easily talked into going outside to the yard for some fresh air once he noticed some workmen in our yard, working on the house being renovated beside us. He dragged out his Easter bucket filled to the brim with some of his favourite items... flashlight, necklaces, a few animals, etc., and about four of his trucks as well. I noticed him pointing them out to the friendly workers, even demonstrating what noise they made, much to their enjoyment. </p>
<p>Soon he was back to being his own sweet self, and ate up every bite of some scrambled egg, two slices of "bacon", a full slice of toast, and a glass of soy milk. He ate up all his lunch at noon hour too, so I wonder if he is in a growth spurt. I can't seem to keep him filled up these days! </p>
<p>Off to Costo with Akane and Mirei, whom we picked up at the studio at 5:45. An hour later we dropped them at home, came home and took our leftover Lu Lai dinner upstairs to eat while watching "Good Night, and Good Luck", a movie about Edward R. Murrow and the McCarthy hearings. It was wonderfully done.. and so well acted. I even stayed awake for it all! </p>
<p>I didn't get one photo of either child today; this might be a first.. sad. Bed at 11 P.M.</p>
<p>P.S. Gail is going full tilt on our family history, making new discoveries several times a week! She is back to 1803 on one side, and 1807 on another. We are so excited about this and I can't wait to get at it with her.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/05/breakfast_with_amelia_dinner_w.html">Breakfast with Amelia; Dinner with Riku & Mirei... and parents too!</a></h2>
								<p>Susan, Kevin, and Amelia had invited us out for a farewell (for me) breakfast this morning; we met at the "Bagdad Cafe" on Market Street at 9:10. Amelia was in fine spirits with not a sign of her cough, but she is still fighting it at night and at nap times. I had my usual... two eggs, home fries, and toast; Kevin had potato pancakes served between regular pancakes(!); Susan and Amelia shared bacon, eggs, and toast; and Doug had a fried egg sandwich with two different cheeses on sourdough toast. Yum! </p>
<p>Before being served, I had time to trace out animal magnets on paper for Amelia; she chose the colours and I did the tracing. Later, she, Kevin, and Doug rolled a small car back and forth across the table, complete with jam container "bridges" and a napkin tunnel, to make the exercise more interesting. Kevin took her off outside while Susan drank her coffee and I finished my tea. After hugs and kisses all 'round, with a specially long one for Amelia from me, we said our goodbyes for a month. I know I am going to miss out on some new phrases and comments during that time, but Susan has promised to send pictures and I will check with her blog to see what they are up to in my absence. </p>
<p>The Joseph Schmidt chocolate shop was just down the street, so I stopped to pick up a box of twelve for Virginia and Joe. I was then lucky enough to get in for a hair cut with Bing, my favourite hairdresser in Noe Valley. We came right home and I spent the afternoon putting away the children's riding train from our room, tidying up Riku's books, running the vacuum around once more, and emailing. There was time for tea and a little reading too, before heading off for dinner at 4:45 with Akane, Bryn, Mirei, and Riku (who drove with us). </p>
<p>I had taken along our usual few books, but with a surprise as well. Riku said "Oh! We have another new book today! Why?" Doug had bought "The Giant Turtle", a story based on a Buddhist story of the world, so we read that on the way to the restaurant, as well as "Koko's Kitten" and a book about jellyfish. </p>
<p>Riku was not quite himself; Bryn said he was a bit out of sorts as they were leaving to come over, and he complained of being too warm in the car with us, even with lots of fresh air blowing in, enough so that I was cold. He was fine once we got to the restaurant; he polished off a whole orange and some carrots while waiting for our pizza, and had no trouble eating his one piece. I think we need to order more than one extra large next time we are all together, as he would have eaten more, I think. </p>
<p>Mirei was the object of much attention while we were waiting for our table at "Gaspare's" on Geary Avenue. A friendly woman told us that her daughter had had cheeks just like Mirei's; she said they disappeared once she started to roll over, so we shall see if that holds true for Mirei once she is at that stage. </p>
<p>The pizza was delicious, Bryn's favourite so far, and I think mine too. I loved the sauce on last week's pizza but this crust was much better and I like a good crust! Riku and an older girl in the booth behind us entertained each other before and after our pizza arrived; she would make faces and eyes at Riku and he loved it. </p>
<p>Riku had overheard Doug telling Bryn that "Bud's Ice Cream Parlour", just two blocks down the street from the pizza place, had won the "city's best" award this year. He was the one who suggested we have "Ice cream for dessert? That is a good idea!" and so off we went. Riku had a small taste of "bubblegum", which ended up immediately in my hand.. I took one look at that face and knew he didn't want to swallow it... so he had vanilla, Bryn chose vanilla with blueberries, Akane had one of the ripples I believe, I had coconut... my very favourite, and Doug had fudge ripple. Riku asked each person in turn, as they came from the counter "What kind you are having?" He had a spoonful of mine and liked it a lot, but ate his way very nicely through his small cup very neatly and efficiently. Mirei sat in her car seat beside us on the floor, smiling at whomever looked her way.</p>
<p>Doug found a couple of good CDs at Amoeba Records in the Haight on the way home while I read in the car, and then we watched a couple of taped short TV shows... a documentary on "craigslist" and an Oprah episode on "amazing kids" ... and they were! </p>
<p>We both sat at our computers for almost two hours before going to bed. Doug added the first photos in a long while to a blog entry, we looked at the pics taken last night, and I answered some emails. I'm not down to the bottom of my list yet, as I had hoped to be, but if all goes well tomorrow... </p>
<p>Bed at 1 A.M. ... too late.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/05/san_francisco_to_denver_a_day.html">San Francisco to Denver... a Day Early!</a></h2>
								<p>I woke bright and early this morning and got a good head start on my day, answering lots of emails and writing up blogs I had made notes on. I got so much accomplished, had a quick breakfast, and picked Riku up for the Carnival parade at 10 A.M. as planned. Bryn, Akane, and Mirei were heading out to Hayes Valley to a street fair, and I suggested they take their time and stay out over Riku's naptime, as he could nap at our place. My day was all planned: while Riku napped, I would gather all my trip items for Doug to pack for me and I would clear out the fridge, water the plants, and finish up my few emails. I had a quiet evening planned with Doug; we would watch a movie early after dinner at home, and get to bed at a decent hour for my 9:15 flight tomorrow. I wouldn't have to get up until 6:30 which was fine. </p>
<p>Well, we had a grand time at the parade. Riku loved it all; he sat on Doug's shoulders part of the time, mesmerized by the colourful costumes, the dancing, and the music. He sat on a mat with some small children next to us and was thrilled when he had candy thrown his way... a mini Tootsie Roll, two mints, and a tiny vanilla-flavoured Tootsie Roll. He kept switching between holding them in his hand and putting them in his shirt pocket. He was wearing a new cotton shirt and looked adorable; Bryn said he was the cutest kid in the Mission and I think he might have been right! </p>
<p>Riku asked if he could have some of his candy; it was still morning, but it was a special day, so I gave him a tiny piece, which he chewed and chewed away on. I had taken along a slice of toast for Riku, and he agreed to eat all of that before having any more candy; he is so good about this kind of thing and it surprises me each time. </p>
<p>After the other family left, he sat on the curb or stood holding on to the rails, peeking through at all that was going on. His two biggest parade offerings were a small ball that one of the dancers gave him, and two shiny necklaces I managed to catch for him. We stayed for an hour and a half, with Riku thrilled with it all. </p>
<p>Off we went to Rainbow to buy sourdough bread for Brynnie, the rest of the Toronto family (Bryn had asked for his own loaf this time; he told me he would pay for it when I came), and a loaf for Virginia and Joe.</p>
<p>And now my day got interesting... I had tucked Riku into bed and the phone rang soon after that. It was Virginia, Uncle Frank's sister in Denver, wondering where I was! Egad! I was supposed to be in Denver! Right then! They had been to the airport to pick me up, and when I never arrived assumed that somehow they had missed me, and that I had taken a limo to their house. Nope! I was enjoying what I thought was my last day in San Francisco. </p>
<p>This was the very first time I hadn't entered my flights in my calendar; in my head I knew I was flying on the holiday Monday, and I was... but from Denver to Toronto, not to Denver! Oh my!</p>
<p>First things first...  I called the airline and with much help and co-operation from the folks at United managed to get standby seats on the 5:03 flight. I had two hours to get to the airport, so we all went into action. Doug pulled out the suitcases and put all the things I have been gathering together for the trip on the bed to pack for me. I called Virginia and told her when I would really arrive, and then called Akane to suggest that Bryn be at the house by 3 P.M. to pick up Riku or stay while he napped.</p>
<p>All went beautifully, thanks to everyone... Doug did all my packing and made me a cheese sandwich for the flight, Bryn brought Mirei over and lay her on the bed to entertain us while we packed and organized my bag; she is such a smiley little girl, and provided me with many happy snuggly moments while we did this. She was cooing away at Doug and I had time to take some photos of her holding on to her feet while spreading them out in opposite directions. Bryn dashed off to pick up a bottle of port from Brent for Uncle Frank and me, while Akane was at home kindly making me my favourite noodles with veggies, and my very favourite inari and some carrots for the flight. Bryn cut up the last of the celery for me, as I knew Doug wouldn't bother with it. </p>
<p>Riku woke up just before 3 P.M. and I went into him and told him I was leaving today. He put his arms around my neck and held me for the longest time; we had some quality snuggling time before I had to finish up the last of organizing my carryon bag. </p>
<p>Two hours after my call from Virginia, I was on my way to the airport. Bryn and Riku came with us, and we said our goodbyes as I went through security. I went to a cafe and had a very tall cup of hot tea, and ate one of my delicious inari. I had missed lunch in the rush and was happy to sit and take my time eating and enjoying my tea. </p>
<p>There was lots of room on the plane, and I had a set of three seats all to myself. I dozed a little during a boring movie, read the airline magazine, and two hours later arrived in Denver. Virginia and I spotted each other at the same time with no difficulty at all. And Kelly's right; Uncle Frank does look like Virginia with wig on! We had some laughs about the mix-up today, and I was grateful that I was able to get the flight which arrived at 8:30 and not the one at 11 P.M. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank looks very well; he is slim and standing straighter than ever before. He looks very relaxed too, and it was lovely to see him tanned and smiling, waiting for me to come over to him. </p>
<p>We drove the twenty-five minutes or so to their home, admired the crescent moon in the clear sky, and chatted away over tea and biscuits until 11:15... fifteen minutes past their normal bedtime. It was a lovely relaxing end to what had started off as a lovely and relaxing morning!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/05/denver_to_toronto.html">Denver to Toronto</a></h2>
								<p>The household in Denver awakens at 8 A.M. I woke at 7:20 and just lay in bed reading until I heard everyone up. The plan was to go out for breakfast, so after a glass of orange juice we were all ready to leave the house by 9:15. We drove to a place where they had eaten dinner a few nights ago, called "The Village Inn"; Uncle Frank and I had eggs and toast with potatoes, Virginia and Joe had the pancakes. I got a lovely big insulated pot of tea with another pot of hot water; what a treat to not have to dunk my tea bag in a mug! Small things make me happy. </p>
<p>We went back to the house right away to pack up for the trip to Toronto. I wrote a note to Joe and Virginia, leaving it on a box of Joseph Schmidt truffles for them, to be discovered after I left, and Virginia was pleased with the loaf of sourdough bread as well. Uncle Frank carefully planned his gift to them, leaving it on his bed... a new keyboard and mouse for their computer.</p>
<p>At noon hour my hosts busied themselves in the kitchen, calling us to the table for a shared "Amy's vegetarian pizza with vegetables", and a delicious salad prepared by Joe: mixed greens with red pepper, onion, cubes of avocado, and tomatoes. We had iced tea and a cookie with it, and set off at 1:15 for the drive to the airport. We soon had the ordered wheelchair for UF, and said our goodbyes to Virginia and Joe, who stayed to wave goodbye from an upper deck until we were through security. </p>
<p>Our flight was delayed for twenty minutes, so we had lots of time for a slow walk to a cafe for a cold drink. I had purchased a sandwich for this flight at Rainbow yesterday... a grilled tofu with field greens and pesto, and UF bought a roast beef and cheese on a bun. Once again we lucked out with seats; I had booked us a window and an aisle and even though the plane was close to being full, we didn't have to share that third seat. UF was very pleased with our "picnic" dinner. I had two oranges and some organic grapes with me. We ate our sandwiches, and then topped that off with some delicious chocolates Akane had packed in with the inari and noodle dishes. Lucky us! </p>
<p>By' and Jo' were there to meet us at 9:30; we were the last off the plane, and the bags took a long time to get to us, but by 10:45 we were home in hot and humid Niagara Falls. We had been told on the plane that the temperature in Toronto was 33C and everyone groaned. It was 86F in the house, and in no time By' had the AC going and we were looking forward to being cool again. Uncle Frank so loved the weather in Denver... blue skies in the mornings, lightly clouding over in the afternoon, but with dry air always. He will miss it, but most likely will be back this summer for a second surgery. </p>
<p>By, Jo', and UF each had a beer, UF's first alcohol in seven or eight weeks as Joe and Virginia do not drink. Jo' had brought over a plate of delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies, so we indulged and each had one. UF is down to 161 pounds(!) and would be happy to keep his weight down to under 165. We shall have to try to stick to Virginia's spa diet, which consists of very small portions of everything they eat.</p>
<p>Jo' and By' left about 12:30, and UF and I headed upstairs to bed soon after. I was worried about the stairs but he does amazingly well on them; he is now using two canes but on the stairs goes up as he did before the surgery. Lights out at 1:15 A.M.</p>
<p>p.s. Doug wrote later to say that Akane, Bryn, and the children had been over later in the day after a few hours at the beach with Susan, Kevin, and Amelia. Akane was doing laundry and they ended up staying for dinner, which Akane prepared there; while she was busy with that, Riku was also busy making a very large and elaborate "dinner" in the backyard on the picnic table... he took out all of his plates, cups, and glasses, pulled lots of grasses and greens from the garden and had quite a feast all ready for everyone. What a guy!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/05/hot_hot_hot.html">Hot, Hot, Hot!</a></h2>
								<p>Whew! It is hot and muggy here, and quite a change from foggy San Francisco and dry Denver. I slept until 9:15, as it took quite a while to settle down with the house so hot last night. Once we awoke, we had the house shut up with blinds closed, but the front and back doors open for some light. The office and bedrooms were comfortable, but the kitchen and rec' room are chilly; hard to keep this house evenly heated/cooled. At one point Uncle Frank put his shoes on just, as he told me, to get the circulation going in his feet! </p>
<p>We had a busy day: after a light breakfast of cereal, toast, and juice, Uncle Frank busied himself with mail sorting, going through seven plus weeks of mail, flyers, bills, etc. He was also on the phone a lot as there are many projects around the house he wants to take care of before the fall.</p>
<p>While he was in his office with all of this, I unpacked my bags and his, did some laundry, pulling the sheets off Neal's bed as well, so his room is ready when he comes to visit, and generally got the house in order after all the time away. </p>
<p>I called Beth in the morning and had a long chat. It's hot at their new house with no air conditioning; I can't imagine how she is managing as she is used to having it and it really is so hot and humid out today. She plans to go in the pool for a while before going to work this afternoon. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank was hard at work in the office all afternoon, so I had some reading time in the living room... feet up, the house finally cooler, and I dozed a little too. In the late afternoon we finally left the house to run some errands, with a trip to the bank, the drugstore, the cleaners, and a final stop at "A Fine Kettle of Fish" for their Tuesday night special, a favourite of ours: one piece of fish with chips, all wrapped up in newspaper. This has a take-out special price of $4.99, and we enjoyed it at home, sitting in the cool kitchen. </p>
<p>Glenn and Wendy had called saying they would be over for a visit and bringing dessert with them. We had a lovely visit with them with tiny cheesecakes and tea; Glenn and Uncle Frank had chatted for a long time this morning as well, but I was glad to see him as I had called and been unable to leave a message. </p>
<p>After they left Uncle Frank got busy on the computer, so I made some phone calls... to Geraldine, Ian (whom I won't see until next week as he is off fishing on Friday), and Marie.</p>
<p>When Uncle Frank was finished on the computer, which is acting up and causing him no end of frustration, we settled, opened up the lovely port he had bought before he went away, and sat ... are you ready???... with a fire going in the rec' room for an hour. Actually, we turned the fireplace off after a half hour or so but Uncle Frank was feeling chilled, no doubt partly because he is tired and did a lot of sitting today as well. It was lovely to get back to our familiar quiet end to the evening.  </p>
<p>I had time to write to Virginia before heading off to bed at 12:15.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/05/a_busy_day_and_dinner_with_by.html">A Busy Day and Dinner With By' and Jo'</a></h2>
								<p>I woke at 8:20 this morning; a full eight hours sleep feels very good after the past few busy days. UF had set his alarm for 8:30, something I hope to talk him out of soon. However, he showered and after breakfast of poached eggs, turkey bacon for UF, juice, and tea, he was once again busy in his office, today going through over 200 emails and deleting lots of jokes, and junk emails as well. </p>
<p>I spent the time transferring UF's summer clothes into his room and moving the heavier winter clothes out. I did a couple of loads of laundry so that everything is ready for him in the fall when the cold weather arrives. </p>
<p>The time flew by again today, although with UF in the office I am getting behind in emails and blogging. I am keeping notes until his busy time is over, and meanwhile am plowing through my latest book faster than I have in months! It's quite a pleasure to sit in the living room, all caught up with the tasks I had set for myself, dozing off a bit and reading.</p>
<p>We had lunch at home at 1 P.M. and, wanting to stay close to Virginia's light but tasty meal plans, we shared a can of mushroom soup, made with half water and half 2% milk, a few California pistachios for dessert, and some hot tea.</p>
<p>Midday I took one of Jo's delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies into the office for Uncle Frank, with a glass of juice. </p>
<p>We had planned to go out this afternoon to buy fresh produce, and a few groceries, but waited in for a fellow coming to see about the eaves troughs. We had hoped he would be here at 3:30 but he didn't make it until after 5:30. No visit to Beth's and Paul's new house once again, as various tradespeople were around today. I'm amazed at how much UF has managed to get done in these two days since arriving home.</p>
<p>We had the AC working all night, and decided to turn it off this morning; it was 69F in the house when we woke, and so with the fan blowing and the outside air heating up, we were much more comfortable than yesterday. </p>
<p>We had been invited to By' and Jo's for dinner tonight; we set off at 6 P.M. and dinner was on the table just a few minutes after we arrived. Lesley was there with us, and we had a delicious dinner and a nice evening with them... grilled chicken, green salad, potato salad, mashed potatoes, whole wheat bread, and a tasty asparagus and mixed vegetable assortment. Dessert was low-fat vanilla ice-cream with strawberries and blueberries atop a small shortcake. We had homemade strawberry wine with dinner and tea before leaving for home around 9:30. </p>
<p>The A&P grocery store, just over the bridge from UF's, is open 24 hours a day, so off we went for our groceries. We picked up two lots of already prepared frozen fish... breaded tilapia, wild salmon in dill sauce, lots of fresh fruit, and a few canned goods as well. </p>
<p>I got everything unpacked while Uncle Frank checked his emails; he was having trouble with the computer so was ready to take his break with a glass of port in the recreation room. This will seem hard to believe but it was cool enough down there that UF turned on the fireplace for fifteen minutes until we were both comfortable. We sat and chatted for a long time but still managed to get to bed before midnight. </p>
<p>Candy arrives tomorrow!</p>
