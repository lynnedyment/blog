								<h2><a href="/2006/11/a_mirei_and_margaret_day.html">A Mirei ... and Margaret Day!</a></h2>
								<p>Well, this was another busy day that just flew by. Doug and I were both amazed to find it was 1 A.M. when we turned out the lights! My day started off by picking up Akane, Riku, and Mirei at 9:15 for the drive to school. Mirei promptly fell asleep, and Riku entertained us with making body sounds, naming them in Japanese and then giggling away! I told him he was "sooooo four year old male" and he liked the sounds of that too; kept repeating "soooo four year old" and making me laugh. We know where he gets his potty humour; I laughed when his dad did the same thing... something I lived to regret by the time he was seven. I can't take all the credit though; it does seem to be a boy thing.</p>
<p>Akane was going to a pot luck gathering at the home of one of the "Little Angels" preschool group; it was a chance for the adult group to get to know each other, and lasted all morning and up 'til 1 P.M. when many of the children get picked up. Akane had a great time, and stayed in the area until 3 P.M. when she met Riku. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mirei was here with me, making as big a mess as she possibly could in the time she had between eating and napping! She pulled herself up on the play kitchen again today, but this time decided she could reach the top shelf and pull down all the little plastic cups, glasses, and plates too. They came crashing down all around her and was she pleased with herself! Oh yes! And then it was on to the big basket, where she pulled out everything she could find by sticking her hand in and wiggling it around until hitting pay dirt. Of course, in between these two occupations, she was busy trying to reboot my computer or, at the very least, try to get behind the sideways placed rocking stool that Doug puts in her way. All those blinking lights, though, just catch her eye every time she is on her way to Grandpa. This little girl just doesn't give up! We now clap our hands and/or say "No no!" to her, which makes her smile her lovely smile and get back to it as fast as she can maneuver under and around the seat! What a gal!</p>
<p>Doug has been very busy working at his computer this past week, but Mirei knows he needs a break now and then. Using that little finger of hers, she goes in, plops herself beside him, catches his eye eventually, and then points... to the chiming clock (she's opening and closing her fist now for the tick tock), or to the giant frog on top of the hutch. Doug walks her around the house, strumming the strings on the various instruments hanging on the living room walls, stopping to show her the photo of her Daddy and Auntie Kelly from fifteen plus years ago, and letting her check out the bird in the downstairs hallway. She's very appreciative, as she wants to see them every single day, if not more often. </p>
<p>When I'm feeding Mirei her veggies, fruit, or cereal at the table, she will use that finger to point to her water glass when she wants to drink. It's time to get out the baby signs book and start teaching her those. Amelia had a huge vocabulary long before she could talk, and it was the most amazing thing to see. She has been pointing for some time at the brooms when I ask where they are, and is quite intrigued with the "Aunt Jemima" bank and the twirling wind-up duck on a bike on the bookshelves too; she makes it quite clear that she wants to have a closer look at them. What a fun time this is; her world is <strong>so</strong> exciting! </p>
<p>Mirei napped for only an hour in the car and so was ready for her afternoon nap right at noon hour today. She slept for an hour and a half, and then had a lovely long warm bath with lots of water in the tub. At home she bathes in the sink still, and it's such fun to her to be able to be "floated" along on my hands and arms. She puts her head back and seems to really enjoy that sensation. And of course splashing hard on the water is huge fun! She blinks the water away from her eyes, leans way over to grab a duck or spinning toy, and wasn't all that keen to get out of the tub even after a good half hour. I wrapped her in the big blue towel, warm from the dryer, which Amelia and Riku both like so much as well. Mirei enjoyed her massage with cream, just as they do, although she was less patient for getting her back rubbed. </p>
<p>On to food! She ate three times today; can't believe how that little mouth just opens for the next bite even after she had eaten a good sized bowl of whole grain cereal and a lot of fruit and/or veg! Of course she is burning a lot of calories just trying to keep my house in chaos, so I shouldn't be surprised. </p>
<p>Off we went in the stroller at 3:45. Usually Akane takes Mirei home  in the stroller while I take Riku to the playground; often Mirei is having her afternoon nap then or just waking, but today Akane and Riku met us there. It was such fun to watch Mirei watching the world out there! We stopped on the highway overpass, as we always used to do with Riku, so she could see the cars speeding by under us, and of course I stopped to let her smell the flowers and touch some leaves and vines. That little back was just so straight, taking in the world in the ten blocks or so between us and the playground. </p>
<p>Riku was as delighted to see me as Mirei was her mommy! Mommy means nursing and Mirei has no patience at all once Akane is within sight; just pass her over and let her settle in and you have a happy girl. Riku is delighted to have me sit in the sandbox with him, and bury each other's feet. He seemed very tired to me, and later Bryn said he was awake at 6 A.M.; that hour, and sometimes an hour and a half, less sleep showed in his white face and dark eyes. He did lots of running and jumping though, but was not happy to leave the playground so soon. I decided a slow walk home for him would work better than a fast one today, but I ended up carrying a very tired little fellow all the way home! </p>
<p>Doug was there promptly at 5 P.M. as we planned; he carried a sleeping Mirei up the stairs in the stroller... full tummy, plus nursing, plus fresh air equals sleeping baby. Off we dashed in heavy rush hour traffic over the Golden Gate bridge to Corte Madera to get decent seats at a book reading with Margaret Atwood. We lucked out and managed to get third row seats (the first two were reserved). She is a tiny woman and so interesting... witty, wise, and of course such a wonderful writer and reader too! We had an hour to wait for her, and I found a special event taking place at the used book store across the way; I had a glass of red wine and some St. Andre cheese with crackers... yum! and sat reading my own book until the reading at 7 P.M. Susan had seen her many years ago at university, but this was both Doug and my first reading with her and how pleased we were to finally see her read in person. </p>
<p>We grabbed burritos at "World Wrapps" before heading home, eating just half of them and saving the rest for lunch tomorrow. It was delicious... mine was grilled tofu strips, carrots, lots of broccoli, and terkyaki sauce with jasmine rice on a whole wheat tortilla. Yum! Kelly would have loved it; this particular chain moved out of SF before her last visit, much to her chagrin. </p>
<p>Home around 9 o'clock, watched a couple of taped shows, although I fell asleep while Doug kneaded my back for me during the last one. No problem; the show couldn't have been better than that back rub!</p>
<p>p.s. Mirei learned how to let herself down from a standing position today! She will stand for ages against a bed, the little kitchen, or mirrors, but go get down always lets out a little whine, indicating she needs help. However, today she was on the carpeted floor when I checked on her. So I stood her up again and just a minute later, bent those little legs, and ever so slowly lowered herself down. I gave her a big clap, she gave me a big smile, and she repeated this several times during the afternoon. Yay!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/11/making_mirei_laugh.html">Making Mirei Laugh...</a></h2>
								<p>I woke up today with no sinus pressure; what a relief; that little Neti pot of Bryn's did the trick! More sleep would have been good, but going to bed after 12:30 does not guarantee that. I woke at 6:45... too early, so vow tonight I will be tucked in by 11 P.M. </p>
<p>On with my day... I finished the ironing! Yahoo! I must, must, must keep up from now until forever, as there is nothing I dread more in the housekeeping mode than a rack filled with shirts and slacks needing to be pressed. </p>
<p>The rest of my morning was as usual, and at 12:15 I went off to pick up Amelia from daycare. When she was saying goodbye to the other children, she went behind each of them, put her hands on each side of their heads, and leaned over to kiss them on the top of their heads! It was adorable. </p>
<p>She will soon be moving to a five-morning-a-week Montessori program, closer to her home, so we won't be stopping for our coconut gelato any longer. It was a treat to do so today, another warm and sunny one here, once the heavy fog lifted, and we sat on the sidewalk chairs talking about contrails (none spotted today) and the tall steeple we can see from that vantage point.</p>
<p>Amelia did a couple of drawings for me, which are now hanging on the kitchen window, and played on her own until it was nap time. I wish I could tell you that Amelia had a lovely long nap, or even a short one(!), but again today she was determined not to sleep, and that was that. She allows herself to come close, cooperating after a while and closing her eyes, but just as she is close to dropping off, she senses it and sits right up. Today, however, I left her three times for five minutes each on her own, hoping she would drift off, but each time she called out. She agreed to stay in bed for ten minutes, not crying, and not getting out of bed, and she kept that promise. Up she got; we will try again on Thursday. It is so obvious that she is tired, but it's mind over matter and Amelia has her mind made up some days that it's not going to work. </p>
<p>She was delighted to find Mirei here when she came out of her room; the feeling was mutual. They sat together on the floor, playing with long necklaces and flashlights. At one point Mirei was in the small bedroom, while Amelia stayed outside in the hallway, playing peek-a-boo with her. The laughing went on and on, with Mirei having that wonderful belly laugh babies have at this age, and Amelia taking such pleasure in making her happy. </p>
<p>Amelia is always game for playing outside, so off we went at 4 o'clock to meet Akane and Riku at the 23rd Street playground. Riku came barreling up to me when he spotted us and asked, "Why were you not there when I got here?" I guess we usually are first, and I'm sure he had been waiting all of five minutes at the most. Nice to know I'm missed! </p>
<p>Akane had been chatting with a young mom named Kim, whose daughter is just ten days or so younger than Mirei. Her name is Vivian, not a typical name for these times, and she's very sweet. She too is standing, and doesn't want to sit down; she was trying to get her little leg over the edge of the small wall we were sitting on. Both girls have four teeth, and are at the same point of standing/walking, so have lots in common. We hope to see them again, as they live just a block from the playground and go twice a day. </p>
<p>Amelia and Riku had a great time together; they climbed on the open dome, took turns pushing and being pushed on the round-about, kicked a ball back and forth to each other, and played with the sand toys for a bit. </p>
<p>Mirei sat and let the coarse pebbles stream through her fingers; we must do this more often with her, as Riku was an old hat at it by this stage. Of course he was not a child who put everything into his mouth the way that Mirei does right now; she's bound and determined to taste everything! However, she really didn't try to eat it today, so we will do more sitting in the sandbox in the coming months. </p>
<p>Akane and Mirei left when it got quite cool, and Akane kindly lent me her scarf. It was so warm in Potrero Hill, and so cool in the Mission District... brrr. Riku and I kicked a ball back and forth for a while, and then he and Amelia played in the outside area on the other side of the playground until Susan joined us. We said our goodbyes and left at the same time. </p>
<p>Susan wrote later to let me know that Amelia did fall asleep on the way home; not a surprise at all, as she was tired when she was fighting sleep here four hours earlier. One day she will realize, I hope, how good it is to allow herself to drift off. </p>
<p>Made a cup of hot tea, ate a light dinner, and had planned to watch a movie with Doug once he got home at 7:30. However, it was a samurai film called "Harikari", which was too dark and depressing for me to watch after a busy day. We saw it many years ago at UBC in Vancouver, as I recognized bits and pieces of it while putting the laundry away. So down I came and got lots of emails answered instead, although somehow my inbox is filled to the bottom of the "page" again! </p>
<p>Up to bed at 11:30 P.M.</p>
<p>P.S. Election day and at this hour the Democrats are in the lead by a good margin!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/11/mirei_arrived_at_the_door.html">A Busy Saturday</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei arrived at the door today with her dad at 11 a.m. this morning. It is such fun peeking at her through the glass and seeing that big smile as she recognizes my face. Her parents and brother were off to Japantown and to run other birthday-related errands for Riku's birthday party tomorrow. His actual birthday is on Monday, but friends and their parents are invited over tomorrow from 11- 1p.m. </p>
<p>Today when Doug was carrying her up the stairs, Mirei was craning her neck to see the bird that hangs on the back wall. She is at such a sweet stage as objects become familiar to her. She likes me to pull the broom over to her when she's sitting at the table so she can touch the bristles, always points up to the large frog from Mexico in the dining room, and now is moving her fingers back and forth to indicate the clock bonging away. </p>
<p>Bryn had told me that she was tired and ready to eat, so after a bowl of cereal and two little dishes of pears, she waved bye bye to Grandpa and off we went to bed. Such an easy routine for this girl... wrap the soft blue blanket around her firmly, start the bird swinging, turn on the sound machine to the waves, and rub her tummy for just a very few minutes. Two weeks ago she started making lots of noise is she lies there settling herself... big loud grrrrr's, patting the back of her hand against her mouth so she makes the "ba ba ba" rhythmic sound we all know so well, playing with her hands and fingers, and finally starts to drift off by rubbing her ears and her head. Riku rubbed his head as well when he was settling himself, so it's fun to see his sister comfort herself in the same way. </p>
<p>She slept for two hours and forty-five minutes! At the hour mark I heard her make a little noise, and she smiled at me, making me think for a minute that her cat nap at home and this nap was all she needed. However, as I was pulling her shirt over her head she started fussing, making her tired sound, so the blanket went back 'round her, and she was asleep two minutes later... for an extra 95 minutes! </p>
<p>I made a carrot cake and then called Don to wish him a happy birthday; my baby brother is 53 years old today! We had a very long chat; he has no special plans for dinner but he and Beth were going out to see a puppy for the second time. This will be the first dog they have owned but it's a little house dog and won't tear up his carefully tended and lovely gardens. </p>
<p>Mirei likes raisin toast, and sat at the table feeding herself little bits while I spooned in lentils and veggies. She was playing happily on the floor when Bryn and Riku came in for a little visit. Riku wanted to paint, after he had eaten a snack... juice and raisin toast with cream cheese, and Mirei was busier than I have ever seen her pulling herself up on the kitchen chairs and carefully lowering herself down again. I worry when she does this on the wood floors, but she is so controlled now. I worry more about her pulling the plastic play kitchen over, but for now she is very happy pulling all the items from the top of that shelf down instead. Oh, I took some photos of her feeding her dad; he just has to say "ahhh" with his mouth open and she will pop some food in for him. It's a game and she takes pleasure in it. I remember Riku doing exactly the same thing, although he learned eventually to pull it away at the last minute, and then laughed so hard when Bryn looked surprised to not have it! How the time has flown! </p>
<p>We all left the house a 5 p.m. Riku waves and blows kisses each and every time, and it's lovely to see. That little family of three went home to join Akane, while Doug and I went to Safeway for a few groceries. Then it was time for dinner at Cafe Gratitude, our second visit using Doug's birthday certificate from Akane and Bryn. It was already very busy at 5:45 but we shared a communal table, as we did the last time, and once again enjoyed our dinners so much. I could easily eat my way through their menu, although the amusing thing is, that whilst eating my main course tonight, I realized I had ordered the same dish as I had in August! It was a "warm grain" dish, called "I Am Grateful", consisting of steamed quinoa, delicious small fresh tomatoes, and a fresh basil-almond pesto. It is so good and I ate only one third of it; I'll happily be eating it again tomorrow, and perhaps on Monday as well. Doug and I also shared an appetizer called "I Am Insightful"; it was "live samosas-two spinach-wrapped samosas filled with almond sesame pate and marinated veggies, served with a spicy fresh mint dipping sauce.  There is no flour used for the samosas but only pressed spinach that has dried. It's amazing how good this all is! Doug had one of the specials.. an spicy enchilada served with fresh dressed greens, and quinoa. One day I am going to order one of their salads as they look so wonderful. In the evenings I always am drawn to the warm dishes. </p>
<p>I cleaned up the kitchen, and we went upstairs to watch a movie, with no internet for five hours at that point. Doug was told there were problems with the phone company and that they expect to have it fixed in the wee hours. Bed at 11 p.m., a good excuse to get up there early, with no last messages to write. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/11/an_amelia_saturday.html">An Amelia Saturday</a></h2>
								<p>Our day began at 7:30 when Amelia rolled over, smiled at me, and then leaned over to give me a kiss, telling me she loves me. How very sweet; she had rolled over about 6:30, half sat up and looked around the room, and then cuddled in again next to me. I woke up at 7:15 and lay quietly waiting for Amelia. We did just what I had promised her last night would happen, starting off our day by reading in bed, and then when we heard Grandpa, we covered ourselves completely with the duvet, and waited for him to "find" us. We had deliberately left the monitor running so he would hear us, and he went through the routine of coming in to see if we were there, checking out the bathroom, then the kitchen and on to the front door to see if we were downstairs. Finally, hearing some giggling, he came into the room again, hearing some little giggles and/or seeing something moving. Amelia gave out a big shriek when he discovered us and pulled off the cover. We read three more books before getting up. </p>
<p>Oh, one funny thing happened... I was all stretched out with my ankles crossed once we had pulled the covers up again, and when Amelia was getting out of bed she told me I looked just like a carrot! </p>
<p>We had a nice quiet few hours at home this morning with no rushing about, and no hurry to get out. Amelia played happily at the desk, drawing pictures and sorting through the rubber dinosaurs and other tiny animals. I checked my emails, and then dashed upstairs to shower quickly, before joining Amelia for breakfast of eggs, "sausage" for her and "bacon" for me, plus toast and juice. I had time to read the paper too, while Amelia entertained herself in the bedroom with the stuffed animals and with more drawings. </p>
<p>Finally it was time to go off to the playground; the day was warm and sunny early today and there were lots of children there with their dads. Amelia found a three-year-old boy named Cameron to play with; we may have met him before. They are just a couple of weeks apart in age, and played well together. Amelia was sad when he finally had to leave, but there were three other children still there over the noon hour to play with. I chatted with a young mom and dad who had an eight-and-a-half-month-old daughter named Zia; she was a smiley girl like Mirei, only much bigger... St. Bernard hands and feet. Her mom thought she was big and laughed when I mentioned the size of her hands especially! </p>
<p>Amelia came running over to tell me she had pushed a girl off the climbing structure; it's interesting that she doesn't hesitate to say what she did. We sat on a bench and had the lunch I had packed; I decided it was nap time with no extra time for playing and after a stop at the library for a bathroom break we were in the car and driving. Amelia was asleep in less than fifteen minutes and slept for two solid hours. Once again I napped while we were parked in a fairly quiet shady spot, although Amelia had no trouble with the big service trucks that rumbled by occasionally. </p>
<p>Home for some playtime here; Amelia took great delight in using the grownup scissors to cut paper. She hadn't quite managed yesterday but today made a fringe all around her drawing! She did four drawings today and of course they all go up on the windows. Sometime soon I must take photos of them all and take them down so we can see out to the garden! </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin called to speak with Amelia; I held the phone to her ear and she answered Susan's questions about her days, but then passed the phone to me telling me it was my turn now. They had just eaten dinner and been bowling, relaxing and enjoying their time together. I was hoping to hear that Susan was sleeping through the night, but it didn't happen. Too bad... but too many years of waking frequently in the night have created a pattern that is hard to break. </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin had told us to treat ourselves to Amici's pizza, delivered, as their treat, and so we ordered it at 5 P.M. I had asked for take-out though; Doug thought it would be good to get out anyway, and just as we were getting into the car, along comes the Amici delivery car! It was our order, delivered at 5:20(!) and I was delighted not to have to go out after all. It was delicious; we had a salad too, and Amelia ate a whole piece as well as some spinach and rice. </p>
<p>While I tidied up the kitchen, Amelia played more at the table (she has really entertained herself so well today and yesterday!), and then I ran the tub. All the plastic and rubber animals went in, Amelia had a grand ol' time, and I sat on the floor with my tea, playing the part of King Kong wanting to be friends with a little blue turtle. </p>
<p>Of course we did the usual wrapping in the big warm blue towels, which both children love, and Amelia knows the massage routine oh-so-well, thrusting out one limb to have rubbed at a time. Tonight she asked me to put my fingers between her toes and fingers, even though the toes tickle her a bit.  </p>
<p>Doug read her one book again tonight, and I the second, and then came a few tears. She and I snuggled in while we talked about our day and what we might do tomorrow. When I was going over the day with her I deliberately left out the fact that she had pushed a little girl, but she prompted me immediately when I went on to our picnic on the bench! </p>
<p>I had turned out the light at 7:45 tonight, expecting it would take me forty-five minutes to settle her in, but it took an hour and a half! I was very surprised as she was tired and relaxed after her tub, happy to get into bed for stories, and settled down very quickly... but not to sleep. I kept thinking she was asleep too... nice even breathing, not moving an inch, but three times when I tried to get out of bed Amelia was promptly up asking where I was going and back we would be at step one. </p>
<p>Time for emails and a little bit of sorting of the baby clothes, now pulled out of the chest of drawers in the guest room and piled on the living room sofa! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2006/11/saying_goodbye_to_san_francisc.html">Jody Leaves for Snowbound Vancouver</a></h2>
								<p>It looked this morning as if Jody really would be leaving San Francisco, after her canceled flight to Vancouver scheduled for last night. So we had a bonus day ahead of us, which flew by as quickly as the last eight days. We had oatmeal for breakfast, later than Jody would have liked it, I'm sure, as I slept in until almost 8 A.M. today. We sat in the living room, enjoying the sunshine while reading; I was determined to read the morning paper before leaving the house today. </p>
<p>Finally, at 11 o'clock we headed off to Noe Valley for some leisurely window shopping. Chilly day despite the sunshine... brrr! However, It was a neighbourhood we hadn't explored this trip, and there are many interesting independent shops there. We oohed and ahhed over darling baby clothes, admired the antique-looking Christmas hanging mats, and found some very funny Christmas and birthday cards. We sampled various creams for our hands, with vanilla and shea butter combined to make us smell very nice indeed. We spent quite a bit of time in the knitting and wool shop too, admiring all the gorgeous yarns. It has been a long time since I had the time to just meander like this in San Francisco, and it was great fun. </p>
<p>I found a few Christmas gifts as well, and a heavy stainless steel container that sits in the corner of my sink. I always hoped to find an antique enamel one like the one we had when we were kids, but I have almost given up hope of finding one that isn't too rusty. </p>
<p>We stopped at each posted menu we passed, and I finally realized I was hungry. We held out, though, until we had explored each store that interested us, and instead of coming home and eating some of the leftover Chinese and Thai food we have in the fridge, we convinced each other that it would be a long time before we could just sit and enjoy a restaurant meal together. Part of this was due to the board menu at <em>Pasta Pomodoro</em>, stating that the special of the day was penne with lemon sauce, and soup or salad. The salad was just great with mixed greens, freshly shaved Parmigiana cheese, bits of blue cheese, and a perfectly light vinaigrette. We were both hungry and enjoyed the focaccia with pesto alongside it, but the pasta was divine! </p>
<p>And of course one can't leave Noe Valley without buying a coconut macaroon at the local bakery. I had ordered three topped with chocolate but discovered they were sans chocolate once we got home. Oh well, they were still moist and delicious. </p>
<p>We went directly over to "Little Angels" preschool to pick up Riku. The small foyer at the school is wonderfully decorated with a huge Christmas tree, with tiny Ultramen on it as well as all the usual baubles... Riku was thrilled with it when Bryn dropped him off this morning... and we stopped to admire it on the way out at 3 o'clock. </p>
<p>Mirei has a fever still today, and Jody wanted to see Amelia before leaving, so today worked out well for us. Akane stayed home with Mirei and we made plans with Susan to meet at their playground at 3:15; we all arrived at the same time with Amelia and Riku spotting each other from across the park and waving madly to each other. It was very cute to see. We went upstairs for a few minutes, put an extra layer of clothing on each child, plus mittens(!), and off we went to the playground for an hour and a bit. I got to be the monster again and chased them merrily around the slides and swings, while Jody and Susan chatted; it has been almost two years since they last met. Jody of course sees lots of photos of Amelia, but it was great that we managed to get them together before another year or more passes. </p>
<p>Riku was a tired boy as we drove home. He had a bag full of art projects with him, and had shown them all to us when we picked him up; there were autumn leaves cut from orange, yellow, and green paper, which Riku held up while singing "Autumn leaves are falling down... " to the tune of "London Bridge is Falling Down", a very colourful and beautifully decorated Indian headdress, and the cutest Thanksgiving turkey, done up in a paper frame complete with a wool hanger. Riku's eyes were closing, closing, as we pulled up in front of the house at almost 5 P.M; he still has a cough and is obviously still jet-lagged, but what a trooper he was, giving his sister a big hug when he went into the house. She was happy to see him too; Akane says she is so happy to have company and is a happier baby with lots of people around. It was hard to just kiss and run but we did. Jody had a date with an airplane! </p>
<p>We had just enough time for a mug of hot chocolate and a half macaroon each, Doug had put the bags in the car before he left for the bus to T'ai Chi, and we drove off to SFO at 5:35. Traffic was light, and we had Jody checked in and heading for Immigration and Customs by 6:05. The week together flew by and we packed lots into it. I would never have gotten so much of my shopping done if Jody hadn't been with me, and now I must get busy for the following week and wrap it all up. It seems strange to be mailing gifts to Toronto, but the earlier the better. This will be my first Christmas ever without Kelly, Brynnie, and Caillie. It's hard to imagine, but I also know how lucky I am to have spent so many with them; some grandmothers aren't nearly so fortunate... but still... </p>
<p>I had forty-five minutes in the house on my own before leaving to pick up Doug from his class. It ran long tonight and so he didn't get to eat dinner until almost 8 P.M., but he enjoyed the leftover pasta and bread as much as we had; I added fresh tomato to his to make it stretch further and we both had a tiny sticky bun Susan had kindly handed over to me at her house. Yum! Warm with butter... oh yes! </p>
<p>We went upstairs to watch a rented DVD of an Eddie Izzard concert filmed in San Francisco; I thought he was a singer, and was quite delighted by the humour of this very funny comedian. We were laughing out loud at so many parts of it; I know he wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea, but we were entertained for almost two hours. </p>
<p>Time for a blog finally(!) ... and reading a few emails too. Bryn IM'd to say Riku was asleep at 7:45 and Mirei tucked in at 8:30. I hope Amelia was snugged in early too; she was as pale as Riku was at the playground, although they both had such fun together. Riku calls her "Melia"; I thought I had better make a note of it in case we forget. They are growing up so very quickly... </p>
<p>Bryn IM'd me with a photo of Mirei in Japan, being admired by a group of nurses at the clinic where Akane's grandmother lived. I got to see those very chubby cheeks of hers again! My favourite current thing of hers right now is the way she says "Oh!" when she spots something and then points to it. That little mouth just puckers right up! What a darling baby girl she is...</p>
<p>And then Bryn wrote: "Riku is sooooooo silly... was having what seemed like a half-dozen or so parallel conversations with himself. " Almost every day brings something new with one of the three children here in San Francisco. How lucky I am to be here with them all!  <br />
