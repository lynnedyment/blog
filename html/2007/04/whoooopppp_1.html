								<h2>A Fourth-Generation "Whoooop!"</h2>
								<p>Well, I won't go into detail today about how much Mirei ate, how long she napped, etc. etc. as I keep thinking about how quickly she is changing, and how I really need to get it all down before I forget. Days are busy and sometimes the little things get forgotten. </p>
<p>A Dyment tradition for many years — starting with Doug's dad — was for him to call out in a fairly loud voice "whoooop!" to announce that dinner was on the table. This made sure the children heard the call whether they were in their rooms with music playing or downstairs in the recreation room. Bryn has continued to do this with his children (Kelly did too, but Gregg doesn't find it a very dignified way to call family to the table, and I am not sure how they do it now), but Bryn uses it, I believe, to call Riku back to the table for dessert. A few days ago, Bryn told me that Mirei had started to imitate him; it was quieter and more like a "woo" but you could tell she had the idea. Well, now she "whooops" with the best of them! It is really the funniest thing to do. I guess she feels she has to practice, as both yesterday and today she was heard walking about the house whoooping away. </p>
<p>Mirei is an official walker. It has been two days now since we have seen her crawling for more than a minute; even when she loses her balance, up she gets, and is back on her feet. She tends to like to crawl in the upstairs hallway for some reason, but that may be because I started crawling after her, "chasing" her on my hands and knees some time ago, and I think she likes it a lot. </p>
<p>OK, so we also have a serious climber on our hands now. Man oh man! This is one challenging period of time with her, as she really wants to climb on everything, and, to top it off, finish by standing on every surface too. That little right leg of hers really struggles to gain a foothold on whatever challenge she is into at the moment. Last week it was the sofa; it's still too high but every day she checks it out. But, she did succeed in getting up on the big overstuffed chair in the living room. She knows perfectly well she is not supposed to stand on it, and she is careful to keep a close eye on whether or not she is being watched. The minute I spot her, she starts to sit down, although there is a huge twinkle in her eye, as though I might just not mind <em>this</em> time. Hah! I take her off the chair each time she stands on it; it's too soft and with a wooden floor under her, I can just imagine the bumps and bruises after the first fall. </p>
<p>On to the kitchen. We have a little plastic IKEA table in the corner, with two chairs beside it and one stool underneath it. For the past two weeks, Mirei has been attempting to get up on the red metal chair on her own, finally figuring it out last week. Well, now that's not nearly interesting enough for her. The table top beckons , and how easy it is to get right up there beside the pencil crayons and Riku's wooden box of treasures!  Yesterday and today I had to put the chair outside in the garden so that I didn't have to stand there saying "no" time after time. So today she decided she could stand on the chair; I turned my back to go into the laundry room, tossed something in the washer, and turned around to see a beaming away girl, both arms in the air! I did not grab my camera to take a photo! </p>
<p>Well, the other chair was still available, and it works just as well for climbing on too, and on up to the table. Two chairs outside. And the stool? Well, she grunted and groaned to get that out, finally furiously called out to Doug to get it for her, and instantly decided she could get up on that instead. It's now on the kitchen counter. I think we will continue with climbing up the slide at the playground and some of the lower steps there, before practicing on the table tops here. </p>
<p>Mirei likes to do something at the table other than just eat, so she has a little collection of books and treasures to call on both at home and here. She is very good at making lots of noises and grunts until we have figured out what she wants. Even Riku is good at it. "You want a book Mirei? Okay, here you go." "Oh, you don't want that one? Here is another one." "Oh, you want the purse? There you go." and on it goes. Sometimes it's the jack-in-the-box, or the bunny, or one specific book...</p>
<p>... and sometimes it is the little pottery bowl that holds tiny things that Mirei can't have unsupervised. It contains three tiny flat ladybug decorations, one teensy weensy little yellow ball, a tiny key chain Riku found at the condo when I was in Japan with him, and one reddish rock. She handles them all carefully, likes me to share in her pleasure in them, and occasionally one will fall down. Mirei leans waaaay over in her high chair, putting her hands up in the now all familiar Italian-like gesture of "Where is it? I don't know!" </p>
<p>This morning, one of the three ladybugs fell and neither of us could find it. I got down on the floor and told her it was gone. Her eyebrows go way up, as though she too is perplexed as to its whereabouts, but finally we gave up. At lunch, as I was putting her in her chair, I spotted it on the seat, and showed it to her. "Here it is!" She gave me a big smile — I am soooo clever! — and then pointed to the bowl on the shelf so she could put it back, well satisfied that it was back in place. </p>
<p>Kisses... and more kisses. That's what we are getting around here lately. Mirei will come up behind me when I'm at the sink and plant five or six kisses on the backs of my legs. She walks over to Doug at the computer and kisses his leg. She kisses her dogs, and her "baby", and Bryn told us the other day she walked into the living room, knelt down, and planted a big kiss on the floor! I get kissed about twenty times as I am holding her to put her down for her nap, and she pulls on my arm at the table, linking her hand through my arm, to give me kisses on my cheeks. Sometimes she even holds my face to kiss my mouth! And of course she kisses Finn; he's a real live baby and she plants one on him every chance she gets. She's our own little "kisseroo"! And just to prove my point, I just went in to get her from her nap, and while I was changing her, she kissed her own palm, something she often does with me too, and then blew kisses to all her imaginary fans waiting on the sidelines! </p>
<p>The best part of the day, I think, was spending time in the back yard with Mirei late this afternoon. Now that she is walking, she can get around the garden without having to crawl on the brick patio. How she loves being out there, and how much I love having her with me! She loved using the little broom I have for Amelia and Riku, she really enjoys digging in the dirt with her hands, and she apparently loved pulling the freesia blooms off some bright yellow flowering plants too! We spent forty-five minutes puttering about; I had started cleaning up the yard while she had her two-hour nap, and she helped me finish it off. Lovely. </p>
<p>Little notes about the day: Bryn left for Seattle tonight, and said goodbye to Mirei when he dropped her off after 8 A.M. Mirei fought her morning nap, but finally settled in for just one hour, waking not happy at all. Very clingy. I think she's teething, as fingers are in her mouth constantly. It's not something she has had trouble with before, but these incisors may be tough for her; they were for her daddy too. And she fought like mad at bedtime too: it was after 9:30 before she finally gave in. It was really hard work for me, since I am so used to her being so easy. </p>
<p>I did a little time on family tree, finding some children for long ago Parcels, but was pretty darned tired when I finally did get to bed.</p>
