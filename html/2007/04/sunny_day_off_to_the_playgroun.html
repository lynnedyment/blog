								<h2>Sunny Day ... Off to Play!</h2>
								<p>I had such plans for this morning... first a hair cut, then a long walk with Finn in the park, and possibly picking Riku up from school for some Ocean Beach time with him. The day was sunny and warm, although there was a good breeze blowing, but it seemed a perfect day for all three of these things. However, I started in on some paper work... tracking down finding a doctor who works with our new discounted medical plan, filing some papers and moving on to sorting out Mirei's and Riku's three bedroom drawers in the spare room. Before I knew it, it was time to hustle up to Noe Valley to get my hair cut and be back in time for Mirei's arrival. I feel like a new woman with my shorter hair; I was about a month overdue for a cut!</p>
<p>Mirei had napped from 11:30 until 1 o'clock today, so there was no afternoon nap in store for her today. She was a happy little bee though, buzzing around her Grandpa for the most part, but occasionally stopping by to toss some socks into the drawers I was still sorting, and teasing me with going up the stairs. She's so easy, so content to walk around the house, trying occasionally to stand on the chair and see if I notice, doing a little drawing, and learning to blow one of those paper blow-outs that unwind as you blow... how she loved getting that skill down pat!</p>
<p>Akane said she hadn't had time to finish eating her lunch, so I topped her up with pasta, sauce, and olives, with a side dish of sauteed spinach cooked in garlic. She liked it all enough that she was attempting to eat with two spoons and one fork! Today she didn't need any more amusements at the table besides the cutlery as she attempted each one in turn, mostly doing a very good job of it too.</p>
<p>We left the house at 4 P.M. to meet Akane and Riku at the park. It was quite blowy but warm enough that I unzipped Mirei's pink sweater and attempted to have her wear her sunglasses. Like her cousin Caillie, and unlike her cousin Bryn and her brother, she would rather squint away at the sun, turning her head to avoid it, then keep the glasses on.</p>
<p>Riku and Akane reached the playground just minutes after we did. Mirei was in the sandbox playing happily when Riku joined her. This was a fun day for Mirei as she played in the play structure for the first time today, climbing up the stairs to the top with some help, but then sitting up on the little bench with Riku, peeking out at her mom on the other side, for the longest time. She obviously just loved being a "big kid" today! I put her on all the rocking toys, and we had her on the teeter-totter too, which she particularly liked, and then lay flat out in the sand, letting the sand run through her fingers. What a busy happy girl she was wandering around just like the other children; she has never done this at this playground since she has been walking full time, and she got lots of exercise. I bet she wasn't hard to put to sleep tonight! Before we left, she wandered around on the grassy area too, and I managed to snap a photo that wasn't in the full sun.</p>
<p>Riku meanwhile was pretty much entertaining himself. There was a grandmother there with her two little ones, and much to Riku's delight, she was willing to be a "monster" and growl and prowl around the playhouse for them. How he loves this! When she finally took a break, he sat to read his new Ultraman book, really a hard copy of a catalogue showcasing all the monsters and various Ultramen available. I glanced over to find him turning over the pages with this friendly woman, who was kind enough to show lots of interest in it. He did lots of running around and climbing too, and he and I ran part of the way home, thinking we would catch up with Akane and Mirei, who had left a few minutes before we did.</p>
<p>We did take a few moments to admire the handiwork of an artist who has been painting the side of a Victorian building on 23rd Street. Riku had asked one day about how people could reach so high to paint on buildings, so it has been very handy to see one being done so close to home. Weeks ago, it was mostly sky and sand; the next time there were a few trees and a religious mission. Riku went right up to speak with the artist the second time, and  again tonight, as now there is a woman standing in a stream, washing her hair, and a ball court for a traditional Mexican game, plus grasses and more detail. Riku has enjoyed watching this take shape and I think the man doing the painting is very happy to discuss it with him. </p>
<p>One of the things that amazes me about Riku is that many months ago he was taught to wash his hands as soon as he comes in from outside. He just never forgets to do this! After I took him upstairs and said goodbye to them, he was torn between washing his hands and waving to me out the window, another habit that he never forgets. Even if he is busy watching something, or involved with a book or a building project, Riku will run to the window and stand there waving until I am out of sight... and it's the same for everyone in his life, no matter where he is. Tonight I reminded him he had just washed his hands at the playground before we left, and so he went off to stand on the trunk to say goodbye in our own way. Sweet boy. I did see Mirei's little hand waving goodbye as her Dad drove away with her on Sunday too though, so she has already picked up on it too. Sweet girl.</p>
<p>Tonight was my monthly doula meeting and instead of being held at the hospital we were meeting at one of the doula's home to watch a birthing video, filmed in the Black Sea in Russia. I've seen it before and own it, but tonight we watched the shorter version of it, forty minutes, and it had footage I hadn't seen before. Always inspiring, always difficult, as we see not only the ideal births but the ones that take place under less than ideal conditions... glaring lights, loud voices, babies whisked away too quickly to be washed, swaddled before they are placed on the mom's skin... tough indeed. But the water births are astounding and I never ever tire of seeing them. One of the moms births her own baby with her young children watching their baby brother arrive, underwater, and with such love and tenderness. There wasn't a sound to be heard in the room.</p>
<p>We have some funding for our meals now so instead of pot luck, Nonnie picked up some delicious and tasty food for our meal... marinated veggies, four different styles of hummus, crispy healthy crackers, delicious cheese, a big green salad, guacamole, and with good quality chocolate squares for a sweet at the end of the meal. We had six new doulas attending tonight, which bodes well for more women having a support person with them during their labour. I'll be back in time from my trip east for the next meeting too. Plans were made to have t-shirts silk-screened for us; we just have to come up with an idea for the front of the shirts, but know that they will say "SFGH DOULA" on the backs. Yahoo! </p>
<p>Off to bed early, as I am walking Finn tomorrow and will have Amelia here for her afternoon nap as well after school. The packers will be at Ashbury Street and Susan and Kevin's move takes place on Thursday. What a busy month this has been for everyone!</p>
<p>A little side note: We lost Mom nine years ago today. Hardly seems possible that it has been that long. How she would have loved all these children in her line! Mom often mentioned that as long as we had children she would never truly die; that a little bit of her is in each one of them, and this is true of her parents and her grandparents, all the way back through our history. I do find it comforting to know she really felt this way.</p>
