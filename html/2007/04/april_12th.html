								<h2>Busy Girl, Busy Nana!</h2>
								<p>Miss Mirei woke at 6:05 today! That will teach me to go to bed earlier, as once again I was up working on my family tree later than I should have last night. </p>
<p>I was wearing a sleeveless cotton nightie this morning and Mirei was totally fascinated with my bare arms. She touched them, and smiled shyly at me, kissed them, and stroked them. She's going to love the summer when all of our arms are bare! </p>
<p>Mirei continued kissing us throughout the day, giving me big big hugs, kissing my hip when I was sitting, and Doug's leg when he was busy at the computer. What an affectionate little girl she is; she has won all our hearts with her sweetness. </p>
<p>She had a grand ol' time playing in the kitchen this morning, taking apart her toy kitchen, pulling out as many cupboards as she could manage, but also playing with her stuffed animals for the longest time in the bedroom. She likes coming and going on her own now, although often that "going" involved climbing up the stairs without telling her Nana first! They are very steep and just one little slip means a long tumble down, so I have learned to keep the kitchen door to the hallway closed. Mirei is so quiet that I don't leave her leave the room and start heading up. Funny though, as she will always turn around to see if I am coming after her! </p>
<p>Mirei was once again really determined to climb up on chairs today, so required lots of attention. And the funniest thing of all was the little looks she would give me when I caught her at it! What a character she is, as she gives you her "Who me? Did I do something wrong?" look!  Gone are the days when this little girl happily stayed in the kitchen playing with her basket of toys. Guess she is growing up! </p>
<p>Mirei ate a big lunch of mac' and cheese today, with a side of spinach. She continues to hone her fork skills and the macaroni is easy for her to "stab". It is funny though as she will use her left hand most of the time, her right hand occasionally, and both hands, sans fork or spoon, for the rest of the meal. </p>
<p>We went off to the playground again today with Grandpa; she does love the swings, and of course the sand box, especially if there are other children nearby, is such a hit with her. </p>
<p>For dinner she ate another huge portion of the Mexican casserole, broccoli as her veg', and the whites of two boiled eggs as well as some of the yolk. She felt sooo heavy to me, and after Susan mentioning that she must weigh close to 22 pounds, I took her up and weighed her, and sure enough, she weighed in at 23 pounds! </p>
<p>While I was filling the tub for her bath, Mirei wandered into the kitchen with just a diaper on, patting her "pom pom" aka ,tummy! She was very happy to have such access to it, and I took lots of photos of her patting away. Adorable. </p>
<p>She had trouble settling down tonight for bed, even after a long relaxing tub, so of course up she got for more food. I guess there was an empty spot somewhere as she ate a full bowl of porridge, applesauce with banana, and all but one spoonful of yogurt! My mother would say she had a tape worm! </p>
<p>Finally tucked her in at 9 P.M. and I made a final cup of hot tea and watched a movie with Doug, happy to be doing nothing but putting my feet up.</p>
