								<h2>Our Girl in the Hood... Sandboxes and Slides</h2>
								<p>I woke early this morning, so had time to read the paper and finish my breakfast before a smiley little girl arrived at my door. She wasn't dressed in her usual style. Bryn has his own version of what goes with what, and she made us laugh... she looked like the girl from the "hood", with beige linen pants... well, okay, the upside of the hood... with a pink long-sleeved t-shirt and a bright red short sleeved shirt with a big yellow star in the middle of it... the Vietnamese flag. Topping this off was a close-fitting pull on cotton toque, and it was adorable.. the whole package!  Those big beams of hers, directed right at us, make us feel pretty special... every single time! </p>
<p>Mirei spent lots of time today walking around kissing everything in sight... Grandpa's legs, my shoulders and cheeks, over and over and over, her collection of stuffed dogs, and her two baby dolls. It is just the sweetest thing; she puckers up and makes contact and then repeats it until she moves on to something else. Oh, she also kisses babies in magazines, and Bryn said the other day she walked into their living room, and got down on the floor and kissed it too! Talk about worshiping the ground someone walks on! </p>
<p>Mirei had been out for breakfast with her dad and Brent, so had food at home, food out, and then of course breakfast here too. We were out of bananas today but she was very pleased with the new addition of strawberries to her bowl. It was a sunny day, and I had the door open to the garden for a while. It's interesting that Mirei often seems content to just be able to look out and get a good view of the flowers and trees without actually stepping out. She needs sturdy shoes on for that until it is warm enough for her to go on the bricks with her bare feet. </p>
<p>She napped from 11-12:30 today, later than was ideal but she was having nothing to do with an earlier attempt to put her down. This is new behaviour for her; occasionally, she would fight going down but now she seems to feel that she must protest each attempt! There is no point putting her down when she's crying though; she might drift off to sleep if left long enough, but there is no way I would have her sobbing herself to sleep, so up she gets. I just hope she doesn't figure out that this happens every time she decides against sleeping, but my guess is there is always a good reason for it... from her point of view. So, more food is offered and more time wandering about, pushing her Miffy walker, or trying hard to get upstairs by herself. She moves fast and can do it with no problem at all, and isn't happy to be thwarted in the attempt! </p>
<p>I have a monitor in the kitchen so that I can hear the children the minute they waken. Mirei usually wakens slowly, first murmuring away and then getting more verbal as she comes 'round. I don't go in to her immediately as she often resettles herself for more sleep, but usually once she's awake, she starts to "chat" to herself. Interesting that she never attempts to get off the bed on her own, but waits for me to go into her. </p>
<p>Today she was ready for action! The minute I opened the door, she stood up in the midst of the blanket she had pulled off herself, and started screeching at a very <strong>loud</strong> volume, obviously quite enjoying the noise! She waved her arms over her head, threw herself down on the pillows, picked up and threw down her stuffed animals, rolled over, threw herself down again... and on it went for the longest time. Doug came in to video tape her, drawn by the noise, but the room was too dark. However, I got lots of fun pics of her antics. What fun it will be for her to see them one day! </p>
<p>The amount of food this little girl puts away amazes me. Today she had a very generous helping of the rice/tomato/spinach dish I had frozen, but then proceeded to eat a custard cup of cooked broccoli... she insisted on eating all of it before finishing up the casserole portion, and then ate a good sized portion of custard with applesauce and mango. </p>
<p>Right after lunch we went off to a playground at the top of Potrero Hill for an hour. What a time she had! I plopped her down in the middle of the huge sandbox, took off her socks and sandals, and watched her enjoy herself. She loved digging her hands in the sand right up to her wrists, letting the sand flow through her fingers, watching me cover up her toes and then touching the ends as they stuck out through the sand. I had taken along a bucket and some digging toys and she used those, and watched the other children running around. </p>
<p>Riku had found a bright blue plastic sea star at Ocean Beach last week, and Mirei discovered it in the bottom of the pail. I told her it was a star, a sea star, and she looked down at her shirt and pointed to the big star there. I was amazed that she had made the connection, and then she made it even clearer that she knew they were the same, as she held the blue star against her shirt, and smiled at me. Yup. She's brilliant! </p>
<p>She went on the swing twice and loved it. I have video to prove it. I put her on the slide many many times and this was a huge hit. Even better was trying to climb up the slide apparently! She really fought to hang on and haul herself up each time she had gone down. This girl will be in gymnastics one day, as she is very physical and will need all that energy channeled! </p>
<p>I was home at 3 o'clock to give her a snack and put her down for a short nap, but again she fought it, despite lots of food in her tummy. We tried twice, but to no avail, and it was soon too late to make it happen. I made twice-baked potatoes for dinner, filled with mushrooms, green onion, zucchini, broccoli, grated carrot, and a nice mild cheese, while Mirei puttered happily about my feet, stopping occasionally to reach up for a snuggle and a kiss or two. </p>
<p>Grandpa took her down to the mail box and did their usual walkabout the house before he left for T'ai Chi at 5:40. Bryn showed up minutes later, and we ate immediately. Mirei ate the potato dish, but not until she had eaten another big bowl of steamed broccoli. Then she and Bryn ate some custard for dessert, I bathed Mirei while Bryn tried unsuccessfully to have a short nap, and after a little more custard, we waved goodbye, about 6:45. Mirei was sooo tired, and her dad could see it after that relaxing bath: she was "zoned". </p>
<p>Gail and I took an hour and a bit to go through our family trees, going through one member of each family line to make sure we had the same information entered and verify any discrepancies. I had some dates and places she didn't have and she had new ones for me too. We are trying to keep them both up to date so that we can do a major download soon to our family tree maker. </p>
<p>Doug came home, ate his dinner, did some emailing until Gail and I quit at 9:15. We have some new movies in to see, but I was tired so we watched a one hour show of a TV drama we started renting some time ago called "The Wire". I am sure to stay awake during this fast paced show as if I drift off I am lost for the following shows. </p>
<p>I came down to write a blog, was too tired to do more than write two quick emails, did a quick hit on the family tree just for fun, and came up with some new names for one of our longest lines... getting back to the late 1500s if I'm correct. Will have to verify it tomorrow when I have a minute. Up I go to my latest book... 10:45 P.M.</p>
