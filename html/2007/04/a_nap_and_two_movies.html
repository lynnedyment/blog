								<h2>A Nap and Two Movies</h2>
								<p>It's the weekend! This was a good way to start it off too, without too many things on the agenda for the day. Even if things get busy later on, it's a perfect day for me if I can sit and read the paper while having my breakfast. After that, I'm ready for anything at all. Simple pleasures and all that... </p>
<p>Mirei came over for her nap, as is quite usual on a weekend morning. Riku was expecting to have a friend over to play and Mirei would be unhappy being put to bed if there were company around. And in reality, two little boys playing with Riku's new Ultraman toys would not be conducive to a long naptime for her anyway. </p>
<p>Bryn brought her over topped up and ready to sleep, so we had just a few minutes together before I tucked her in. It is lovely holding her and singing "The Wheels on the Bus", as I sang it to Riku too at this age, and sometimes still do. With Mirei I also sing ABC to her, as her dad does, and it doesn't take long before that little head is heavy, though she is also quite fascinated with the stuffed mouse these days. She napped for two full hours. Bryn came in to get her just minutes after she woke, and we dropped them off at home before continuing on to the Balboa for our double feature. </p>
<p>We saw two wonderful British movies... "Amazing Grace" about the man in British government in the early 1800s who worked tirelessly to rid Britain of the slave trading that kept many members of parliament wealthy. It was beautifully acted and a flawless movie. The second was a lighter weight film, and I was in the mood for it... "Miss Potter", the story of Beatrix Potter's life. It didn't do so well in the reviews, as many objected to her animal characters being brought to life as she drew, but I found it charming and loved every minute of it. All the lovely scenery in the Lake District just made us want to get back to England as soon as possible. How we loved our time there! </p>
<p>And then it was time to go shopping for some Easter goodies for Riku, who was in Japan for the holiday, and for Mirei, who may enjoy some of the festivities this year. Next year will be better for her, though; not sure if she will "get" finding the eggs quite yet. </p>
<p>We had a lot of trouble finding appropriate little gifts that would fit in the eggs, but found some sea creatures and two little "wan wan"... dogs, for Mirei, and have a bit of candy to add to them too. By this time we were hungry, and not too fussy about what to eat, so we stopped in for a CyBelle's pizza on our way home. The last time we had one it was quite greasy with cheese, but this time it was fine, a little too bready to be ideal but it hit the spot nonetheless. </p>
<p>Home to work with Gail on our family tree site; I was "movied" out, so a long evening filling out names of more ancestors was just the perfect way to end my day. </p>
<p>Happy birthday to my big brother Sheldon, who is 64 today.</p>
