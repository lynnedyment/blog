								<h2><a href="/2007/04/sandboxes_and_slides.html">Our Girl in the Hood... Sandboxes and Slides</a></h2>
								<p>I woke early this morning, so had time to read the paper and finish my breakfast before a smiley little girl arrived at my door. She wasn't dressed in her usual style. Bryn has his own version of what goes with what, and she made us laugh... she looked like the girl from the "hood", with beige linen pants... well, okay, the upside of the hood... with a pink long-sleeved t-shirt and a bright red short sleeved shirt with a big yellow star in the middle of it... the Vietnamese flag. Topping this off was a close-fitting pull on cotton toque, and it was adorable.. the whole package!  Those big beams of hers, directed right at us, make us feel pretty special... every single time! </p>
<p>Mirei spent lots of time today walking around kissing everything in sight... Grandpa's legs, my shoulders and cheeks, over and over and over, her collection of stuffed dogs, and her two baby dolls. It is just the sweetest thing; she puckers up and makes contact and then repeats it until she moves on to something else. Oh, she also kisses babies in magazines, and Bryn said the other day she walked into their living room, and got down on the floor and kissed it too! Talk about worshiping the ground someone walks on! </p>
<p>Mirei had been out for breakfast with her dad and Brent, so had food at home, food out, and then of course breakfast here too. We were out of bananas today but she was very pleased with the new addition of strawberries to her bowl. It was a sunny day, and I had the door open to the garden for a while. It's interesting that Mirei often seems content to just be able to look out and get a good view of the flowers and trees without actually stepping out. She needs sturdy shoes on for that until it is warm enough for her to go on the bricks with her bare feet. </p>
<p>She napped from 11-12:30 today, later than was ideal but she was having nothing to do with an earlier attempt to put her down. This is new behaviour for her; occasionally, she would fight going down but now she seems to feel that she must protest each attempt! There is no point putting her down when she's crying though; she might drift off to sleep if left long enough, but there is no way I would have her sobbing herself to sleep, so up she gets. I just hope she doesn't figure out that this happens every time she decides against sleeping, but my guess is there is always a good reason for it... from her point of view. So, more food is offered and more time wandering about, pushing her Miffy walker, or trying hard to get upstairs by herself. She moves fast and can do it with no problem at all, and isn't happy to be thwarted in the attempt! </p>
<p>I have a monitor in the kitchen so that I can hear the children the minute they waken. Mirei usually wakens slowly, first murmuring away and then getting more verbal as she comes 'round. I don't go in to her immediately as she often resettles herself for more sleep, but usually once she's awake, she starts to "chat" to herself. Interesting that she never attempts to get off the bed on her own, but waits for me to go into her. </p>
<p>Today she was ready for action! The minute I opened the door, she stood up in the midst of the blanket she had pulled off herself, and started screeching at a very <strong>loud</strong> volume, obviously quite enjoying the noise! She waved her arms over her head, threw herself down on the pillows, picked up and threw down her stuffed animals, rolled over, threw herself down again... and on it went for the longest time. Doug came in to video tape her, drawn by the noise, but the room was too dark. However, I got lots of fun pics of her antics. What fun it will be for her to see them one day! </p>
<p>The amount of food this little girl puts away amazes me. Today she had a very generous helping of the rice/tomato/spinach dish I had frozen, but then proceeded to eat a custard cup of cooked broccoli... she insisted on eating all of it before finishing up the casserole portion, and then ate a good sized portion of custard with applesauce and mango. </p>
<p>Right after lunch we went off to a playground at the top of Potrero Hill for an hour. What a time she had! I plopped her down in the middle of the huge sandbox, took off her socks and sandals, and watched her enjoy herself. She loved digging her hands in the sand right up to her wrists, letting the sand flow through her fingers, watching me cover up her toes and then touching the ends as they stuck out through the sand. I had taken along a bucket and some digging toys and she used those, and watched the other children running around. </p>
<p>Riku had found a bright blue plastic sea star at Ocean Beach last week, and Mirei discovered it in the bottom of the pail. I told her it was a star, a sea star, and she looked down at her shirt and pointed to the big star there. I was amazed that she had made the connection, and then she made it even clearer that she knew they were the same, as she held the blue star against her shirt, and smiled at me. Yup. She's brilliant! </p>
<p>She went on the swing twice and loved it. I have video to prove it. I put her on the slide many many times and this was a huge hit. Even better was trying to climb up the slide apparently! She really fought to hang on and haul herself up each time she had gone down. This girl will be in gymnastics one day, as she is very physical and will need all that energy channeled! </p>
<p>I was home at 3 o'clock to give her a snack and put her down for a short nap, but again she fought it, despite lots of food in her tummy. We tried twice, but to no avail, and it was soon too late to make it happen. I made twice-baked potatoes for dinner, filled with mushrooms, green onion, zucchini, broccoli, grated carrot, and a nice mild cheese, while Mirei puttered happily about my feet, stopping occasionally to reach up for a snuggle and a kiss or two. </p>
<p>Grandpa took her down to the mail box and did their usual walkabout the house before he left for T'ai Chi at 5:40. Bryn showed up minutes later, and we ate immediately. Mirei ate the potato dish, but not until she had eaten another big bowl of steamed broccoli. Then she and Bryn ate some custard for dessert, I bathed Mirei while Bryn tried unsuccessfully to have a short nap, and after a little more custard, we waved goodbye, about 6:45. Mirei was sooo tired, and her dad could see it after that relaxing bath: she was "zoned". </p>
<p>Gail and I took an hour and a bit to go through our family trees, going through one member of each family line to make sure we had the same information entered and verify any discrepancies. I had some dates and places she didn't have and she had new ones for me too. We are trying to keep them both up to date so that we can do a major download soon to our family tree maker. </p>
<p>Doug came home, ate his dinner, did some emailing until Gail and I quit at 9:15. We have some new movies in to see, but I was tired so we watched a one hour show of a TV drama we started renting some time ago called "The Wire". I am sure to stay awake during this fast paced show as if I drift off I am lost for the following shows. </p>
<p>I came down to write a blog, was too tired to do more than write two quick emails, did a quick hit on the family tree just for fun, and came up with some new names for one of our longest lines... getting back to the late 1500s if I'm correct. Will have to verify it tomorrow when I have a minute. Up I go to my latest book... 10:45 P.M.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/04/happy_easter_and_the_best_girl.html">Happy Easter! ... and "The Best Girl Ever"!</a></h2>
								<p>Yup, that's what Mirei's dad told me tonight, after he had her home and all tucked in for the night. That comment was followed with this one: "a cross between Ghandi and Rambo". I would say that this is a very good description of this little girl; she's a character for sure, and my mom would have said many times over by now that she must have been around this way before! </p>
<p>Bryn is very proud of this little girl, and takes such pleasure in all her antics. As soon as they left for the evening, he phoned to tell me that she had been waving to us in the car, as we stood waving to her from the front window, and she said "bye bye" too, all on her own, with no prompting. This happened the other night as well, so I guess Mirei has the traditional Dyment tradition of saying goodbye down pat.. </p>
<p>I had a very lazy awakening today; I was awake at 7 o'clock but stayed in bed until 8:10, finishing off my book. It was a page turner and I shall take it home for my sisters to read, and then to Toronto for Kelly at some point. Mirei arrived with her dad as I was checking my email, just ten minutes after I put my feet on the floor. They had been to "Jim's" restaurant for breakfast, where Miss Mirei charmed the crowd. Of course. </p>
<p>Mirei ate a third breakfast along with me at the table, a little while after they arrived, while Bryn kept us company. I didn't get the paper read, come to think of it, and didn't get yesterday's read either! Egad! I love my paper ritual and being two days behind is not a good way to start my week. </p>
<p>Mark called to ask some questions about the depth of information I have asked him to get from his parents on the Feldmann side of the family. One day Bryn and Caillie may be very happy that I did this for them, a gift they may (or may not) appreciate when they are in their later years. Of course perhaps by then, it won't be such a struggle to find this information but with all their grandparents alive and well, this is the time to be looking for any missing links. </p>
<p>I didn't speak with the children, as they are home with Hans for Easter this year, much to my surprise. They always, except for one year, I believe, have spent this holiday with Hans, Mark, and their parents. They plan to go up next weekend, so Mrs. Feldmann's Easter egg tree will remain up until then. Hans Sr. told me that Manitou and Wiki are having a grand Easter holiday, chasing into the woods and back at their leisure. </p>
<p>Bryn and Doug left for a three-and-a-half-hour movie at 10 A.M. Mirei fought the first attempt at napping, got up and ate the rest of her cereal plus most of a yogurt, and was then asleep in my arms within minutes. She slept for a solid two hours and was awake in her bed, quietly moving around, for another twenty. By the time she called out to me, she was up and moving again, throwing herself around as she so loves to do, and just making me smile over and over. </p>
<p>Gail and I had worked on our family tree while she was sleeping, and we got lots done. Gail had a few new bits of information and we continued checking each other's work which is slow going, but worth doing nonetheless. </p>
<p>Mirei ate a good-sized lunch, and we sat looking at photos in magazines until she had polished off most of her mac' and cheese with carrots, custard, and strawberries. She had a little walking around/destroying the kitchen time, both before and after lunch, and then it was off with her dad to run some errands. At three o'clock they went for groceries and then hung out at a café, enjoying our warm sunny day, while I did some dinner preps, and managed to get in a little more time with Gail. </p>
<p>Bryn and Mirei arrived back at 5:45, just as I was getting dinner ready to go on the table. They had time for some peek-a-boo antics in the kitchen... lots of photos of this coming soon in her online album, and some big laughs while she played with his hat. What fun they have together; he just beams at her, and many admiring glances are passed between them. </p>
<p>For dinner we had baked wild salmon, baked sweet potatoes, fresh green beans, creamed corn for the guys (Mirei doesn't seem to care for it any more than I do), and sliced tomatoes, with carrot sticks as well. Mirei ate very well, using her spoon ever so well, for more mac' and cheese, sautéed spinach, which she really likes so much, many bites of salmon from both her dad and me, and hard boiled egg whites, which she polished off with vigour. A little custard for dessert, but her tummy was full, and she lost interest when she heard the words "bath time"! </p>
<p>Bryn looked at my family tree while I was sitting at the tub with Mirei, clicked on his dad's name and came up with several "hits" from the Web site. Later on I found out one piece of information that might be worthwhile on his maternal grandmother's side. Yahoo! </p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was shampooing Mirei's hair. She is the funniest little girl. The minute I get the shampoo on her head, she puts her hand up and starts rubbing and washing along with me. As soon as she can get hold of the bottle, she puts it up and pretends to be pouring in on her hair herself. More and more we see this independent streak in her. Mirei is struggling so hard to get up on my bed, and the chesterfield on her own, as well as the bed she sleeps on. She can almost do all three, but not quite, but every day she gives it a shot just in case today's the day. The other day Bryn told me she had attempted to pull his hat on his head, really working to get the tight cap over his skull. I'm sure we are going to see lots of this strong will in action in the coming years! </p>
<p>Mirei was in her sleepers when she kissed us all goodbye, and waved to us. Minutes later Bryn let me know she was already asleep, a second day in a row with no second nap. However, she slept for ten solid hours in a row last night, from 8:30 to 6:30 this morning, and was a happy girl throughout the entire day. </p>
<p>I got right to work on Doug's family tree, and because of all the research someone in his family has done on that site over the years — there are two Dyment books on their family history already going back to the early 1500s — it was a cinch to just click on each link and add them in. If they are in Devon (Devonshire), or specifically Bradworthy, the town where they lived closest to, and if their names were anything close to Dyment — Daymen, Dyeman, or the like — then they are related and in they went! To think how Gail and I have struggled to find just one link, this was child's play and so much fun. </p>
<p>That was my day... a lovely relaxing Easter Day. Bed at 11 o'clock, and I'm off to choose my next book... always a treat! as I have a huge number to choose from these days.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/04/our_three_breakfast_girl.html">Our Three-Breakfast Girl!</a></h2>
								<p>OK, we have a major eater on our hands!  Here is a sampling of just some of the food she took in this morning! </p>
<p>#1 at home with her Dad: blueberries, a few large ones, bitten in half to a) taste test them, then discard, b) eat half, and pass the other half to her dad, or c) swallow both sides. Then some Os... healthier Cheerio-type cereal, some fried rice, and mu shu chicken. </p>
<p>#2 at Nana's: 2 scrambled eggs, eaten very proficiently with a tiny fork that used to be Auntie Kelly's. </p>
<p>#3 an hour later: generous bowl of oatmeal with added blueberries and mashed banana. </p>
<p>And that did it; Mirei was full enough to sleep by 11 A.M. After thoroughly taking apart her kitchen, desperately wanting the toy "silverware" drawer to add to the mess, and some busy time with the basket of toys, Mirei was exhausted... finally. She was awake at 6:10 this morning, having slept right through (except for two insignificant calling outs),  so was really a very tired girl at 10.  She napped for two and a quarter hours. </p>
<p>She ate a big lunch, of course(!), of udon noodles in broth with carrots, spinach, and zucchini, followed by a cup of custard with applesauce, and water too. </p>
<p>After some moving around time in the kitchen, we all left for a trip to Noe Valley. I had hoped to get my hair cut, but my favourite stylist is in China on holiday, so I have to put up with this too-long hair for another week. Mirei took our hands while we walked to the car, saw lots of dogs, and window shopped with Grandpa for a few minutes. </p>
<p>From there we took her to the playground at the top of the hill. She was close to falling asleep in the car, and had only been awake for three hours, but she was as pleased as punch to be in the swing again, and sliding down the slide into her Grandpa's arms, and digging in the sand for a little bit too. </p>
<p>Came home to a message from Bryn letting me know the two of them are off for a dinner date with Mari. I topped Mirei up with some bagel, apple slices, and soy milk, and off they went at 5:30 together. </p>
<p>Doug left for T'ai Chi; I made tea, and sat in the living room catching up on all the papers from the past three days, and then entered some names in my family tree. I'm way behind, although do have them in another file. Doug watched a James Bond movie, while I worked away on various things down here. It was good to have the time to catch up a bit. </p>
<p>Quiet email day today. I am still hovering at that 200 mark, no matter how many emails I manage to get answered in a day. Still, lovely to hear from everyone, so I'm not complaining. </p>
<p>I had sent off a few emails of Riku, and Kelly wrote to say how amazed she was to see <em>her<br />
 </em> Bryn in him! Vicki, a friend of many years, wrote to say she could see his father in him a lot now, and Akane told Bryn that she thinks Mirei is looking so much like Riku. What fun to see all these family lines in their little faces! </p>
<p>Oh, Mirei was walking about 97% of the time today! </p>
<p>Off to bed at 10:50 P.M., my earliest night in a long time.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/04/such_a_busy_day_1.html">Such a Busy Day!</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei arrived before 8 A.M. today, as usual, looking ever so "indie" in her striped tights, a bright pink top, and navy blue cut-offs. It's fun seeing the clothing choices her daddy puts together! She got right to work taking apart a kitchen cupboard while I made her second breakfast. Where this girl puts the food leaves us all shaking our heads in wonder!  </p>
<p>We went off to an appointment downtown at 9:25, and Mirei was asleep ten minutes later. While I was at the dermatologist, she slept while her Grandpa read in the car. The rest of the day was typical: busy girl, busy Nana. She has discovered a box of wooden sticks in a lower cupboard that she likes to dump out, but today helped me put them back too. Yes, we sing the "clean up" song, but often she is off and busy with another project before the last one is cleaned up. Today she helped me with the laundry, putting socks and underwear into the dryer, one by one, as I handed them to her. </p>
<p>Mirei had a second nap for an hour and a half starting at 2:30, perfect timing as it gave me a chance to make a banana bread for Kevin, and get two casseroles made up... one for Ashbury Street, and one for home. </p>
<p>Today, after I went in to say hello to her (once I heard her voice on the monitor), she stayed on the bed and played for at least a half hour on her own. All her dogs were lined up; she was covering some up with a blanket, and just generally keeping herself entertained. The bed is low and I don't worry about her hurting herself, even if she did fall off, as the past few days she has been climbing up on the living room chair and then standing(!) ... a big "no no"... I take her down each time she stands on it, and on the red chair in the kitchen, too. </p>
<p>Her new trick today was to get up on the chair, and then get onto the play table too! A second new trick (she's full of them these days) was to get herself up on one of the big kitchen chairs by standing first on the crossbars. Mirei is up for every challenge. I think she decided to do this today after watching me standing on a chair to put some dishes away. This little girl needs to be watched very carefully; she takes far more risks than her brother did, and isn't happy to be thwarted in her endeavours either! </p>
<p>Mirei was quite clingy while I finished up the casseroles, and I realized she was ready for her big afternoon snack. I scrambled two eggs and made some toast, and she was a happy girl. There's always a reason if this girl is fussy! No crackers for this gal; she wants a meal mid-afternoon!</p>
<p>Kevin picked us up at 5 P.M. for an evening at Ashbury Street. Doug had a class and Bryn had a late conference call, so off we went, for some time with Amelia, Finn, and Susan while Kevin went off to dinner and a play with Nancy and friends. Susan had made a delicious macaroni and cheese dinner, so will save the Mexican casserole I had brought for other meals. I held Finn, who was mostly quiet and happy, while Susan bathed the two girls. Finn was smiling and then a little fussy, but easily distracted. I sat on the exercise ball and bounced him for a bit as I've seen Susan do many times. </p>
<p>With the girls in their PJs, we all sat down to dinner. Bryn came in soon after and joined us, and had some Finn time too. He seems to have a knack of keeping Finn happy and calm, which gave Susan time to eat, while I watched the two girls wandering from room to room.  Mirei was quite thrilled with Amelia's little shopping cart and pushed that around for a while; she was quite determined to get into it at one point, but her legs are far too short for that! It didn't stop her from trying though, many times. </p>
<p>The rest of the evening flew by: Bryn and Mirei left for home, Amelia and I worked a long time on a 60-piece puzzle... she's good at finding the right pieces(!), and it took us a long time to finish up. I'm not great at puzzles, but it was fun to just sit and work at it together. Susan had been trying unsuccessfully to get Finn to nap, and also cleaned up the kitchen while we did the puzzle.</p>
<p>Then it was tuck-in time for Amelia; Susan got her ready, while I held Finn... got some great shots of him, I hope, on his tummy holding his head way up(!), and had lots of sweet smiles from him too. </p>
<p>At just past 9 P.M., Amelia and I were snuggled in while I read her two stories, and then the coughing started. Amelia must have coughed three times a minute for the next hour, finally drifting off to sleep just after 10 o'clock. She had been sleeping on and off throughout that time, but it obviously wasn't an easy or deep sleep. Both she and Finn have been coughing for a couple of weeks now, and there seems no end in sight to it. </p>
<p>I left the room at 10:15 to find Doug in the dining room reading. He was there to pick me up, and Susan had gone to bed just before 10, after finally settling Finn, giving Doug some rice pudding, and spending a few minutes on her computer. She is one busy woman these days, with not enough sleep under her belt to manage it all. But somehow she does it. </p>
<p>Amelia coughed and called out again at 10:30, so I lay with her until Kevin arrived at 11:15. Parking is tight around that area, and so we let him know where Doug was parked and then I had a minute to say goodnight to Kevin. Amelia was awake; she heard her dad come in... and was ready to sleep with him. I hope they both slept well. </p>
<p>Came home to a darling message on the answering machine from Bryn. Before going to bed, at 9 o'clock, Bryn thought he would "top" her off with some more food... she had eaten mac' and cheese at Susan's, some pinto beans, and a little sweet potato, but it wasn't enough, of course, so at home she polished off steamed broccoli, a bowl of oatmeal with raisins and milk, yogurt, and some "super food" drink!!! I could hear her giggling as she played with Bryn's lip, and saved the message. It was just too cute to delete. Less than two minutes after the call, Bryn said she was sound asleep in her crib. Busy day, busy girls... all of us!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/04/whoooopppp_1.html">A Fourth-Generation "Whoooop!"</a></h2>
								<p>Well, I won't go into detail today about how much Mirei ate, how long she napped, etc. etc. as I keep thinking about how quickly she is changing, and how I really need to get it all down before I forget. Days are busy and sometimes the little things get forgotten. </p>
<p>A Dyment tradition for many years — starting with Doug's dad — was for him to call out in a fairly loud voice "whoooop!" to announce that dinner was on the table. This made sure the children heard the call whether they were in their rooms with music playing or downstairs in the recreation room. Bryn has continued to do this with his children (Kelly did too, but Gregg doesn't find it a very dignified way to call family to the table, and I am not sure how they do it now), but Bryn uses it, I believe, to call Riku back to the table for dessert. A few days ago, Bryn told me that Mirei had started to imitate him; it was quieter and more like a "woo" but you could tell she had the idea. Well, now she "whooops" with the best of them! It is really the funniest thing to do. I guess she feels she has to practice, as both yesterday and today she was heard walking about the house whoooping away. </p>
<p>Mirei is an official walker. It has been two days now since we have seen her crawling for more than a minute; even when she loses her balance, up she gets, and is back on her feet. She tends to like to crawl in the upstairs hallway for some reason, but that may be because I started crawling after her, "chasing" her on my hands and knees some time ago, and I think she likes it a lot. </p>
<p>OK, so we also have a serious climber on our hands now. Man oh man! This is one challenging period of time with her, as she really wants to climb on everything, and, to top it off, finish by standing on every surface too. That little right leg of hers really struggles to gain a foothold on whatever challenge she is into at the moment. Last week it was the sofa; it's still too high but every day she checks it out. But, she did succeed in getting up on the big overstuffed chair in the living room. She knows perfectly well she is not supposed to stand on it, and she is careful to keep a close eye on whether or not she is being watched. The minute I spot her, she starts to sit down, although there is a huge twinkle in her eye, as though I might just not mind <em>this</em> time. Hah! I take her off the chair each time she stands on it; it's too soft and with a wooden floor under her, I can just imagine the bumps and bruises after the first fall. </p>
<p>On to the kitchen. We have a little plastic IKEA table in the corner, with two chairs beside it and one stool underneath it. For the past two weeks, Mirei has been attempting to get up on the red metal chair on her own, finally figuring it out last week. Well, now that's not nearly interesting enough for her. The table top beckons , and how easy it is to get right up there beside the pencil crayons and Riku's wooden box of treasures!  Yesterday and today I had to put the chair outside in the garden so that I didn't have to stand there saying "no" time after time. So today she decided she could stand on the chair; I turned my back to go into the laundry room, tossed something in the washer, and turned around to see a beaming away girl, both arms in the air! I did not grab my camera to take a photo! </p>
<p>Well, the other chair was still available, and it works just as well for climbing on too, and on up to the table. Two chairs outside. And the stool? Well, she grunted and groaned to get that out, finally furiously called out to Doug to get it for her, and instantly decided she could get up on that instead. It's now on the kitchen counter. I think we will continue with climbing up the slide at the playground and some of the lower steps there, before practicing on the table tops here. </p>
<p>Mirei likes to do something at the table other than just eat, so she has a little collection of books and treasures to call on both at home and here. She is very good at making lots of noises and grunts until we have figured out what she wants. Even Riku is good at it. "You want a book Mirei? Okay, here you go." "Oh, you don't want that one? Here is another one." "Oh, you want the purse? There you go." and on it goes. Sometimes it's the jack-in-the-box, or the bunny, or one specific book...</p>
<p>... and sometimes it is the little pottery bowl that holds tiny things that Mirei can't have unsupervised. It contains three tiny flat ladybug decorations, one teensy weensy little yellow ball, a tiny key chain Riku found at the condo when I was in Japan with him, and one reddish rock. She handles them all carefully, likes me to share in her pleasure in them, and occasionally one will fall down. Mirei leans waaaay over in her high chair, putting her hands up in the now all familiar Italian-like gesture of "Where is it? I don't know!" </p>
<p>This morning, one of the three ladybugs fell and neither of us could find it. I got down on the floor and told her it was gone. Her eyebrows go way up, as though she too is perplexed as to its whereabouts, but finally we gave up. At lunch, as I was putting her in her chair, I spotted it on the seat, and showed it to her. "Here it is!" She gave me a big smile — I am soooo clever! — and then pointed to the bowl on the shelf so she could put it back, well satisfied that it was back in place. </p>
<p>Kisses... and more kisses. That's what we are getting around here lately. Mirei will come up behind me when I'm at the sink and plant five or six kisses on the backs of my legs. She walks over to Doug at the computer and kisses his leg. She kisses her dogs, and her "baby", and Bryn told us the other day she walked into the living room, knelt down, and planted a big kiss on the floor! I get kissed about twenty times as I am holding her to put her down for her nap, and she pulls on my arm at the table, linking her hand through my arm, to give me kisses on my cheeks. Sometimes she even holds my face to kiss my mouth! And of course she kisses Finn; he's a real live baby and she plants one on him every chance she gets. She's our own little "kisseroo"! And just to prove my point, I just went in to get her from her nap, and while I was changing her, she kissed her own palm, something she often does with me too, and then blew kisses to all her imaginary fans waiting on the sidelines! </p>
<p>The best part of the day, I think, was spending time in the back yard with Mirei late this afternoon. Now that she is walking, she can get around the garden without having to crawl on the brick patio. How she loves being out there, and how much I love having her with me! She loved using the little broom I have for Amelia and Riku, she really enjoys digging in the dirt with her hands, and she apparently loved pulling the freesia blooms off some bright yellow flowering plants too! We spent forty-five minutes puttering about; I had started cleaning up the yard while she had her two-hour nap, and she helped me finish it off. Lovely. </p>
<p>Little notes about the day: Bryn left for Seattle tonight, and said goodbye to Mirei when he dropped her off after 8 A.M. Mirei fought her morning nap, but finally settled in for just one hour, waking not happy at all. Very clingy. I think she's teething, as fingers are in her mouth constantly. It's not something she has had trouble with before, but these incisors may be tough for her; they were for her daddy too. And she fought like mad at bedtime too: it was after 9:30 before she finally gave in. It was really hard work for me, since I am so used to her being so easy. </p>
<p>I did a little time on family tree, finding some children for long ago Parcels, but was pretty darned tired when I finally did get to bed.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/04/april_12th.html">Busy Girl, Busy Nana!</a></h2>
								<p>Miss Mirei woke at 6:05 today! That will teach me to go to bed earlier, as once again I was up working on my family tree later than I should have last night. </p>
<p>I was wearing a sleeveless cotton nightie this morning and Mirei was totally fascinated with my bare arms. She touched them, and smiled shyly at me, kissed them, and stroked them. She's going to love the summer when all of our arms are bare! </p>
<p>Mirei continued kissing us throughout the day, giving me big big hugs, kissing my hip when I was sitting, and Doug's leg when he was busy at the computer. What an affectionate little girl she is; she has won all our hearts with her sweetness. </p>
<p>She had a grand ol' time playing in the kitchen this morning, taking apart her toy kitchen, pulling out as many cupboards as she could manage, but also playing with her stuffed animals for the longest time in the bedroom. She likes coming and going on her own now, although often that "going" involved climbing up the stairs without telling her Nana first! They are very steep and just one little slip means a long tumble down, so I have learned to keep the kitchen door to the hallway closed. Mirei is so quiet that I don't leave her leave the room and start heading up. Funny though, as she will always turn around to see if I am coming after her! </p>
<p>Mirei was once again really determined to climb up on chairs today, so required lots of attention. And the funniest thing of all was the little looks she would give me when I caught her at it! What a character she is, as she gives you her "Who me? Did I do something wrong?" look!  Gone are the days when this little girl happily stayed in the kitchen playing with her basket of toys. Guess she is growing up! </p>
<p>Mirei ate a big lunch of mac' and cheese today, with a side of spinach. She continues to hone her fork skills and the macaroni is easy for her to "stab". It is funny though as she will use her left hand most of the time, her right hand occasionally, and both hands, sans fork or spoon, for the rest of the meal. </p>
<p>We went off to the playground again today with Grandpa; she does love the swings, and of course the sand box, especially if there are other children nearby, is such a hit with her. </p>
<p>For dinner she ate another huge portion of the Mexican casserole, broccoli as her veg', and the whites of two boiled eggs as well as some of the yolk. She felt sooo heavy to me, and after Susan mentioning that she must weigh close to 22 pounds, I took her up and weighed her, and sure enough, she weighed in at 23 pounds! </p>
<p>While I was filling the tub for her bath, Mirei wandered into the kitchen with just a diaper on, patting her "pom pom" aka ,tummy! She was very happy to have such access to it, and I took lots of photos of her patting away. Adorable. </p>
<p>She had trouble settling down tonight for bed, even after a long relaxing tub, so of course up she got for more food. I guess there was an empty spot somewhere as she ate a full bowl of porridge, applesauce with banana, and all but one spoonful of yogurt! My mother would say she had a tape worm! </p>
<p>Finally tucked her in at 9 P.M. and I made a final cup of hot tea and watched a movie with Doug, happy to be doing nothing but putting my feet up.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/04/friday_its_the_weekend_soon.html">Friday... It's Almost the Weekend!</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei woke at 6:50 this morning, having slept ten solid hours with no waking at all. Lovely for her, but not for her Nana, who really does have to go to bed earlier with this little one in my life. We played in bed for a half hour. How interesting that, like her brother, she isn't ready to bounce out of bed if there is someone to play with. </p>
<p>Food intake again today was unbelievable... dry cereal and apple, oatmeal with banana and blueberries, fried egg, bacon, and a little toast. Two-hour nap... 11:30–1:30... ate brown rice/veggie dish... ate every bite, plus a big serving of spinach mixed in with it. Custard with applesauce for dessert. Snack... goldfish crackers, just because she spotted them (I put out a little dish for them beside her water bottle and she was quite pleased with this arrangement), and a yogurt when she saw me eating one. </p>
<p>Susan called, asking if Amelia could visit for a little while, as she was having car problems and didn't want Amelia to have to hang around a garage. Amelia and Mirei played in the bedroom for a while with the baskets of animals, then sat on the bed together "reading" books. </p>
<p>Susan was back within an hour, with a very fussy Finn. He needed nursing and some time at  his little seat, but he was overtired and ready for sleep when they finally left. I carried a tired Amelia down to the car; she had been at school with a full day behind her, and usually is napping by 3:30. </p>
<p>Mirei and I went outside and did some gardening together. What a busy girl she was, sweeping, inspecting the small pile of leaves and branches, and digging the dirt with her fingers. Her mother would not have been impressed, but how she enjoys it all. She stops to look at the trees blowing and does her little sign for that, returning to watch out for the blue jays and clicking away whenever she heard me doing so. I managed to get one plant potted with lavender, a pink geranium, and flock, a pretty lacy white flower for the edges. </p>
<p>Mirei ate a <strong>huge</strong> helping of the Mexican casserole for her dinner, along with an adult-sized portion of steamed broccoli, all eaten with a fork. She is very good at spearing food with it, and very pleased when she does. Of course fingers work fine too, sometimes with both hands. Dessert tonight was plain custard, the way that Riku likes it best. Just three more days until he is home! I miss him soooo much. </p>
<p>Mirei has been learning to drink out of a small cup or glass lately, and really loves to do it, but she often misses it completely by putting her whole mouth around the lip of the glass and not just her lips. She does a great job, but today I felt she had had enough water, and so took the glass away. Is she strong! Bryn is amazed at how hard it is to take something from her when she is determined to hold on to it. What really surprised me today was her saying "No! No! No!" when I managed to, and then she banged her hand flat on the table. Oh my! It's funny, really, but it just shows us how different she is from her mellow brother.  </p>
<p>I distracted her by asking if she would like a splashy bath and of course that did the trick. How she loves her tub time and cries every time I take her out. Riku still loves to be wrapped and snuggled in a big warm towel, but not Miss Mirei. She has to sit in the tub until the last bit of water has gone down the drain (she watches it carefully), and then still protests about getting out. Her toes and finger tips are always wrinkled, so it's not as though she's in and out! </p>
<p>Of course after her tub, and lots of cream on her pom pom (her tummy, which she loves to pat), and into her PJs, it was time to top her off for the night. So, two scrambled eggs later, with toast and vanilla soy milk, it was off to bed. </p>
<p>Originally, the idea was for Bryn to take her home for the night with him, but it looked as though it was going to be around 9:30, much too late to keep her up. I didn't feel like sitting over at their place, as I had things to do here, so I just tucked her in at 8 o'clock. She was sound asleep in three and a half minutes tonight! The secret now? I hold her close, sing very quietly, and rock her, and it does the trick. The days of just lying her down in this bed are over, as she knows, even when she's tired, how easy it is to move around on the big bed. </p>
<p>After tidying up and making tea, Gail and I worked on our family tree until 10 o'clock, and I continued on for another hour. Bedtime for me right after that, at 11:30.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/04/welcome_home_riku_and_akane.html">Welcome Home... Riku and Akane!</a></h2>
								<p>In some ways the fourteen days since Akane and Riku flew off to Japan have flown by, and in some ways it feels like forever. I know that Mirei will be a very happy girl to see her Mommy again, and her brother too, and Riku will have missed his Daddy and his sister, and just maybe his Nana and Grandpa as well. I certainly missed that little face of his around here, although his sister kept me busy while he was gone. Again today, she was challenging me by standing in the chair, and then sitting down fast when I spotted her! This time I managed to capture that look on camera. </p>
<p>Bryn went off to the airport on his own to meet them for their 10:45 A.M. arrival. Mirei was napping, and it meant she would be ready for action when they arrived. Akane was very tired after the flight, and went home to bed before Mirei woke, but Riku came bursting in, just delighted to see his sister walking out of her room and down the hallway to meet him. It was a very sweet meeting as he wrapped his arms around Mirei and told her he missed her <strong>so</strong> much, and then said, "You growed up!" It was adorable. </p>
<p>Mirei was grinning away at him, and reached out to take hold of a Lego set he had in his hand. He said to her, "It's okay if you break it; I won't mind." I'm sure later on he will be putting it out of her reach, but meanwhile he was happy to be in her company again. </p>
<p>I was waiting for a hug from him, but first he had to run to the window to wave goodbye to his parents. Then he had to tell me all about his new Ultraman toys, and show me all his treasures from his backpack that he had on the plane with him. Then I got a big hug. He looks more grown up to me; funny how that happens when time goes by without seeing a young child. Riku's new short hair cut adds to this older look too. </p>
<p>The children played in the garden, sweeping a little, Riku sitting on the small deck chair he remembered from last year, and Mirei digging in the garden. She spent quite a bit of time today figuring out how to sit on the tiny edge of the bricks. She did it, and I took a series of pics of her doing so, turning ever so carefully around, and finally sitting quite nicely after all the rigamarole! </p>
<p>I put out some snacks on the little stool, and they happily ate freshly baked banana bread and enjoyed some cold drinks for a picnic. Riku has always loved this and how wonderful that he arrived home on a sunny warm day so we could do it. </p>
<p>Later on we came in and went upstairs so they could play with the blocks and car sets together. I just sat on the bed watching them interact. Riku is so amazed that Mirei walks "all the time!" There were lots of hugs and kisses exchanged today, moreso than usual. They missed each other for sure! </p>
<p>Akane came over in the late afternoon, and that little girl was delighted to see her Mommy, and to nurse again. Akane had pumped while she was away and no doubt within a day or two her milk supply will be back to normal. Mirei will no doubt be very demanding in this regard, as I'm sure she must have wondered where her mom and her brother were all this time. </p>
<p>We all walked back to Hampshire Street together, with Akane taking Mirei off to do a little shopping for dinner tonight, while I took Riku to the small playground on 24th Street. He was having a grand time climbing on the serpent there, going right to the top and jumping off from various spots, but at one lower point, just as I turned to look the other way, his foot slipped and down he slid. He had scraped his face and was crying, so I held him and carried him home as requested. Of course, he was tired and upset so promptly fell asleep, making him feel much heavier than he does when awake and holding himself up on my hip. </p>
<p>We waited at the door for Bryn to come home for work, so he could carry him up the three flights of stairs. I did try to rouse him, knowing he would have to have his dinner before bedtime, but he was having none of it. Later on, Bryn IM'd to tell me that he couldn't waken him either, just too tired after that long trip, so he put him right into bed. </p>
<p>Akane was too tired to go to her Chinese class as well of course, so Doug and I had the evening at home, while everyone at Riku's house went to bed early. It was an exciting day, but I was so sad to see Riku with his scraped face at the end of it all. He so rarely hurts himself and to have it be so visible seemed so awful to me. </p>
<p>Gail and I worked on our family tree, I answered some emails, and off I went to bed at midnight.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/04/a_nap_and_two_movies.html">A Nap and Two Movies</a></h2>
								<p>It's the weekend! This was a good way to start it off too, without too many things on the agenda for the day. Even if things get busy later on, it's a perfect day for me if I can sit and read the paper while having my breakfast. After that, I'm ready for anything at all. Simple pleasures and all that... </p>
<p>Mirei came over for her nap, as is quite usual on a weekend morning. Riku was expecting to have a friend over to play and Mirei would be unhappy being put to bed if there were company around. And in reality, two little boys playing with Riku's new Ultraman toys would not be conducive to a long naptime for her anyway. </p>
<p>Bryn brought her over topped up and ready to sleep, so we had just a few minutes together before I tucked her in. It is lovely holding her and singing "The Wheels on the Bus", as I sang it to Riku too at this age, and sometimes still do. With Mirei I also sing ABC to her, as her dad does, and it doesn't take long before that little head is heavy, though she is also quite fascinated with the stuffed mouse these days. She napped for two full hours. Bryn came in to get her just minutes after she woke, and we dropped them off at home before continuing on to the Balboa for our double feature. </p>
<p>We saw two wonderful British movies... "Amazing Grace" about the man in British government in the early 1800s who worked tirelessly to rid Britain of the slave trading that kept many members of parliament wealthy. It was beautifully acted and a flawless movie. The second was a lighter weight film, and I was in the mood for it... "Miss Potter", the story of Beatrix Potter's life. It didn't do so well in the reviews, as many objected to her animal characters being brought to life as she drew, but I found it charming and loved every minute of it. All the lovely scenery in the Lake District just made us want to get back to England as soon as possible. How we loved our time there! </p>
<p>And then it was time to go shopping for some Easter goodies for Riku, who was in Japan for the holiday, and for Mirei, who may enjoy some of the festivities this year. Next year will be better for her, though; not sure if she will "get" finding the eggs quite yet. </p>
<p>We had a lot of trouble finding appropriate little gifts that would fit in the eggs, but found some sea creatures and two little "wan wan"... dogs, for Mirei, and have a bit of candy to add to them too. By this time we were hungry, and not too fussy about what to eat, so we stopped in for a CyBelle's pizza on our way home. The last time we had one it was quite greasy with cheese, but this time it was fine, a little too bready to be ideal but it hit the spot nonetheless. </p>
<p>Home to work with Gail on our family tree site; I was "movied" out, so a long evening filling out names of more ancestors was just the perfect way to end my day. </p>
<p>Happy birthday to my big brother Sheldon, who is 64 today.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/04/sunny_day_off_to_the_playgroun.html">Sunny Day ... Off to Play!</a></h2>
								<p>I had such plans for this morning... first a hair cut, then a long walk with Finn in the park, and possibly picking Riku up from school for some Ocean Beach time with him. The day was sunny and warm, although there was a good breeze blowing, but it seemed a perfect day for all three of these things. However, I started in on some paper work... tracking down finding a doctor who works with our new discounted medical plan, filing some papers and moving on to sorting out Mirei's and Riku's three bedroom drawers in the spare room. Before I knew it, it was time to hustle up to Noe Valley to get my hair cut and be back in time for Mirei's arrival. I feel like a new woman with my shorter hair; I was about a month overdue for a cut!</p>
<p>Mirei had napped from 11:30 until 1 o'clock today, so there was no afternoon nap in store for her today. She was a happy little bee though, buzzing around her Grandpa for the most part, but occasionally stopping by to toss some socks into the drawers I was still sorting, and teasing me with going up the stairs. She's so easy, so content to walk around the house, trying occasionally to stand on the chair and see if I notice, doing a little drawing, and learning to blow one of those paper blow-outs that unwind as you blow... how she loved getting that skill down pat!</p>
<p>Akane said she hadn't had time to finish eating her lunch, so I topped her up with pasta, sauce, and olives, with a side dish of sauteed spinach cooked in garlic. She liked it all enough that she was attempting to eat with two spoons and one fork! Today she didn't need any more amusements at the table besides the cutlery as she attempted each one in turn, mostly doing a very good job of it too.</p>
<p>We left the house at 4 P.M. to meet Akane and Riku at the park. It was quite blowy but warm enough that I unzipped Mirei's pink sweater and attempted to have her wear her sunglasses. Like her cousin Caillie, and unlike her cousin Bryn and her brother, she would rather squint away at the sun, turning her head to avoid it, then keep the glasses on.</p>
<p>Riku and Akane reached the playground just minutes after we did. Mirei was in the sandbox playing happily when Riku joined her. This was a fun day for Mirei as she played in the play structure for the first time today, climbing up the stairs to the top with some help, but then sitting up on the little bench with Riku, peeking out at her mom on the other side, for the longest time. She obviously just loved being a "big kid" today! I put her on all the rocking toys, and we had her on the teeter-totter too, which she particularly liked, and then lay flat out in the sand, letting the sand run through her fingers. What a busy happy girl she was wandering around just like the other children; she has never done this at this playground since she has been walking full time, and she got lots of exercise. I bet she wasn't hard to put to sleep tonight! Before we left, she wandered around on the grassy area too, and I managed to snap a photo that wasn't in the full sun.</p>
<p>Riku meanwhile was pretty much entertaining himself. There was a grandmother there with her two little ones, and much to Riku's delight, she was willing to be a "monster" and growl and prowl around the playhouse for them. How he loves this! When she finally took a break, he sat to read his new Ultraman book, really a hard copy of a catalogue showcasing all the monsters and various Ultramen available. I glanced over to find him turning over the pages with this friendly woman, who was kind enough to show lots of interest in it. He did lots of running around and climbing too, and he and I ran part of the way home, thinking we would catch up with Akane and Mirei, who had left a few minutes before we did.</p>
<p>We did take a few moments to admire the handiwork of an artist who has been painting the side of a Victorian building on 23rd Street. Riku had asked one day about how people could reach so high to paint on buildings, so it has been very handy to see one being done so close to home. Weeks ago, it was mostly sky and sand; the next time there were a few trees and a religious mission. Riku went right up to speak with the artist the second time, and  again tonight, as now there is a woman standing in a stream, washing her hair, and a ball court for a traditional Mexican game, plus grasses and more detail. Riku has enjoyed watching this take shape and I think the man doing the painting is very happy to discuss it with him. </p>
<p>One of the things that amazes me about Riku is that many months ago he was taught to wash his hands as soon as he comes in from outside. He just never forgets to do this! After I took him upstairs and said goodbye to them, he was torn between washing his hands and waving to me out the window, another habit that he never forgets. Even if he is busy watching something, or involved with a book or a building project, Riku will run to the window and stand there waving until I am out of sight... and it's the same for everyone in his life, no matter where he is. Tonight I reminded him he had just washed his hands at the playground before we left, and so he went off to stand on the trunk to say goodbye in our own way. Sweet boy. I did see Mirei's little hand waving goodbye as her Dad drove away with her on Sunday too though, so she has already picked up on it too. Sweet girl.</p>
<p>Tonight was my monthly doula meeting and instead of being held at the hospital we were meeting at one of the doula's home to watch a birthing video, filmed in the Black Sea in Russia. I've seen it before and own it, but tonight we watched the shorter version of it, forty minutes, and it had footage I hadn't seen before. Always inspiring, always difficult, as we see not only the ideal births but the ones that take place under less than ideal conditions... glaring lights, loud voices, babies whisked away too quickly to be washed, swaddled before they are placed on the mom's skin... tough indeed. But the water births are astounding and I never ever tire of seeing them. One of the moms births her own baby with her young children watching their baby brother arrive, underwater, and with such love and tenderness. There wasn't a sound to be heard in the room.</p>
<p>We have some funding for our meals now so instead of pot luck, Nonnie picked up some delicious and tasty food for our meal... marinated veggies, four different styles of hummus, crispy healthy crackers, delicious cheese, a big green salad, guacamole, and with good quality chocolate squares for a sweet at the end of the meal. We had six new doulas attending tonight, which bodes well for more women having a support person with them during their labour. I'll be back in time from my trip east for the next meeting too. Plans were made to have t-shirts silk-screened for us; we just have to come up with an idea for the front of the shirts, but know that they will say "SFGH DOULA" on the backs. Yahoo! </p>
<p>Off to bed early, as I am walking Finn tomorrow and will have Amelia here for her afternoon nap as well after school. The packers will be at Ashbury Street and Susan and Kevin's move takes place on Thursday. What a busy month this has been for everyone!</p>
<p>A little side note: We lost Mom nine years ago today. Hardly seems possible that it has been that long. How she would have loved all these children in her line! Mom often mentioned that as long as we had children she would never truly die; that a little bit of her is in each one of them, and this is true of her parents and her grandparents, all the way back through our history. I do find it comforting to know she really felt this way.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/04/babies_everywhere_today.html">Packing Up ... and Babies Everywhere Today!</a></h2>
								<p>What a gorgeous day for a walk with Finn. The packers were at his house today, and it was so busy with four men scurrying about, packing up Susan and Kevin's household. It was foggy on the far side of the city, and when Finn and I set out from Ashbury Street, I was bundled up with a big sweater and a light scarf around my neck. However, three hours and fifteen minutes later, I had the sweater and the scarf both off and was enjoying the clear blue skies and warm sunshine. </p>
<p>It was another perfect day in Golden Gate Park. I must make it a point to get out there, even though access from their new house won't be nearly so convenient. Doug and I may just have to set out for walks, and perhaps I can arrange some playtime there with Riku and Amelia too, once she doesn't need to nap after school. </p>
<p>Before heading to Stow Lake, I took a stroll through the rose garden, and saw the first roses of the season. Finn was sleeping and I stopped to not only smell the roses, but to take a few photos too. A half hour later, we were circumnavigating the lake. We saw goslings, the now slightly bigger baby ducks from last week, lots of squirrels, turtles of course, sunning on logs in the water, and even a gopher, popping his head in and out of a small hole, much to the amusement of a group of young children out on a walk in the park. </p>
<p>Finn slept a good part of the time, but to my surprise he also was awake and content, looking at the leaves on the trees and the sky from his vantage point. I also got some very sweet smiles from him when I caught his eye; he's getting to the stage where he can entertain himself with just the visuals in his world. </p>
<p>He had nursed at home and likely would have been fine waiting until we got home, but I decided to stop and give him a bottle of breast milk at the DeYoung Museum sculpture garden. He had just started to fuss and I wasn't sure how busy the house would be when I returned. Finn was quite happy for the first five minutes of the bottle but then was ready to give it up. He slept all the way back home, right up to the door, when he started crying for the real thing. </p>
<p>Susan had picked up a variety of delicious sandwiches for the crew, and I was lucky enough to have been included. Mine was brie with pear slices on a wonderful walnut grainy long roll; yum! Finn nursed, and I had some time holding him too; he had big smiles for his Daddy, who was wandering in and out, checking on the packing. </p>
<p>I headed home for a cup of tea, which I had along with my favourite nutty sticky bun Susan had saved for me. I watched an Oprah with my feet up, perfectly happy with my day... lots of exercise, smiles from Finn, and a full tummy. </p>
<p>Amelia, Susan, and Finn arrived about 3:30, with the idea that Amelia would have her nap here, and perhaps join Susan on the trip to the airport to pick up her mom. Even though Amelia dropped off many times into a sleep, the minute Susan tried to leave the room, she was sitting up insisting she wasn't tired. The solution finally was to have her stay here with me, while Finn went to the airport for Oma. </p>
<p>This worked out so well. First we sat in the living room and read two new books, and then Amelia and I spent a half hour in the garden, sweeping and cleaning up. I pointed out some spit bugs to her, which totally fascinated her, and kept her busy finding more of them. She had asked if she could have a tub here so that was next on the agenda. All of the animals from the red tin went in with her, and she played happily, chatting away to them, until I thought Susan would be on her way to pick her up. I had a pair of "glow in the dark" bug PJs Riku had outgrown and they fit Amelia perfectly; she was thrilled with them and anxious to see them glowing later on at home in the dark. </p>
<p>I suggested we go outside with the chalk and do some drawing until Susan arrived. Due to a lost parking ticket and a problem with camera surveillance(!) at the airport, they were held up there for over a half hour, with Finn screaming bloody murder in the parked car. Just what Susan needed to finish off this already too-hectic day. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amelia and I were covering our driveway with everyone's names! I would print a name and Amelia would do the letters along with me. We printed up Daddy, Mommy, Oma, Finn, Bryn, Riku, Lynne, and Nana, ending with Grandpa. Amelia is a great little printer and really concentrates on getting the letters right. There were lots of Ys for her today and she improved quickly after the first attempt. It was chilly, but we were wearing scarves, and when everyone arrived, she went running to give Oma a big hug. I was happy to learn later that Amelia didn't fall asleep on the way home, as Susan feared she might, and was very excited to explore her new house and see her new room. </p>
<p>Doug was at his T'ai Chi class, so I took a cup of tea upstairs and watched the end of an Oprah show, before settling in with Doug for a wonderful Irish movie we had rented. Perfect ending to this day, as we both enjoyed it so much.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/04/its_friday_yahoo_and_a_new_bab.html">It's Friday! Yahoo! ... and a New Baby in the World</a></h2>
								<p>Well, today did not turn out at all the way I expected it to. My intention was to get over to Waller Street for several hours to help with the unpacking and/or to take Finn for a long morning walk. However, Doug had plans to go to Marin county to a sale as well, and left before I was ready to get out the door. The plan was then for me to go as soon as he got back, but that was much later than expected too, at 1 o'clock, leaving me without enough time to be of any use to Susan at all. It's Friday and I wanted to pick Riku up from school an hour earlier than he is usually out, and have some running-around-outside time. </p>
<p>Instead I had a full morning and part afternoon at home, working at various chores... paper work, emails, laundry, tidying, etc. It was great, as it was time I hadn't planned on having. Candy called to say that she had had the angioplasty done on her leg. It was scheduled for Monday morning, but instead they called her in to get it done <strong>now</strong>. I am sure they were worried enough about that clot that they didn't want to leave it in over the weekend. Scary. It went well: Candy is a bit sore, but the clot is gone. </p>
<p>Riku and I met Akane and Mirei at the DeYoung Museum as planned. I had forgotten my camera, but Akane took a few shots for me; Riku so enjoys the little sculpture garden at the museum, and "posed" for a few photos there. </p>
<p>Mirei gave us big smiles; she had been in her stroller long enough, and was as happy as could be to get out as soon as we reached the "<em>blue</em>"playground across the street. How that child loves wandering about under her own steam, now that she can walk and move where she wants to. This mostly meant trying hard to get up on the playground equipment with Riku, struggling with all her might to get up the ladders, up the steps, down the steps, and all on her own, too. Mirei's careful; Akane was holding on tightly to her wrist at one point, but relaxed after realizing that Mirei doesn't take chances. She is bold, though, and carefully navigated her own way down some steps, standing up and going backwards. She's amazing! </p>
<p>Oh yes, Mirei is also quite the charmer. There was a little boy standing near her at one point, and Mirei toddled over to him, wrapping her arms around him. She lay her head against his chest and just stood there, as did he... no doubt wondering what in the world was going on! Then she puckered up and made it clear she wanted to kiss him, which she did, smack on the cheek... she had to stretch up to do this. I finally had to unhinge her from him, although he was still just standing there allowing himself to be manhandled. It was adorable, and his mom told him he was such a handsome boy that the girls couldn't keep away. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Riku was in his glory, up and down the play equipment, trying hard to get Mirei to follow him, before heading off with me into the "forest", a little wooded area where he has played with Amelia in the past. We pretend there are dragons hiding behind trees, and armed with "swords" we go quietly up and down the little pathways. Today a four-year-old Japanese boy joined us for a few minutes, and it was interesting to hear them speaking only English to each other. They went running around in the larger playground area for a while as well. </p>
<p>Riku took such delight in pushing Mirei on the swing today. It was the first time he has done this, and he was so cautious with her, pushing not too far and not too fast. What a wonderful brother she has! She got big kisses and hugs when he first spotted her, and he is continuously kind and thoughtful with her. </p>
<p>Riku spotted another statue on the way back to the car; we had inspected one on the way to the museum, but Akane noticed this second one was of Mr. Starr-King, which is the name of the school Riku will be going to in September! </p>
<p>Dropped everyone at home close to 5. Mirei had dozed off in the car for about five minutes, slept all the way up the stairs in my arms, and came back instantly to full energy the minute we walked in the door. </p>
<p>Quiet evening at home, working on our family tree with Gail. Doug and Bryn went off to a 9:30 movie, but first Bryn demonstrated how Mirei had saved herself from a potentially bad fall off his lap... throwing out her hands to protect her face from hitting flat on the floor... fast reflexes(!) and then told a hilarious story of how she had managed to squeeze into a space behind Riku's chair, by <em>pushing</em> it forward, while he was sitting in it(!), and then squeezing behind it, all the while holding on to it! She is unbelievably strong, this little girl. </p>
<p>After they left, I sat at this machine until 11:30, struggling with one family of two marriages and many children, and not winning the battle. Lights out an hour later. </p>
<p>Notes: Nicole Long sent an email with photos of her darling baby boy, James Connor, born April 22 and weighing 8 pounds, 12 ounces! She and James looked thrilled and happy with this beautiful boy.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/04/ukeleles_and_pizza.html">Ukuleles and Pizza</a></h2>
								<p>Today disappeared in a flash; most of our Sundays seem longer, as often we spend the day at home. I can always use a full day here to catch up on all the things that were neglected during the week, like emails and blogs and photos, but today we were out the door at 10:30. We picked Riku up and drove to Hayward for a ukulele festival. Riku was recovering from his high fever from late yesterday, so sat in the back seat quietly reading on his own, flipping through some Ultraman comics and catalogues he brought back from Japan. We thought that sitting and listening might be fun for him, and it was for a while. Mostly he sat on my lap looking through his magazines, looking up whenever a more lively piece caught his ear. </p>
<p>We wandered outside in the sunshine for a bit when he was ready to stretch his legs; we sat and had a "picnic" and watched the crowds, gaily done up in Hawai'ian costume with leis and bright flowers everywhere. </p>
<p>Doug was disappointed that there was not more diversity in the ukulele playing (it was more a Hawai'ian festival than a ukulele one), so we left around 1 o'clock, stopping first to buy candy floss for Riku. We had promised him some at Pier 39 last month, and then didn't see any as we continued walking, so today was to make up for that promise. It didn't come in the familiar plastic bag, but in a plastic container and made into flat circles(!) ... the first time we had seen it this way. It was handy though, but after a mere half a circle Riku said his tummy felt funny and he had had enough. He's not used to much sugar, and it's great that he knows it doesn't make him feel so well. </p>
<p>There was a wonderful older woman roaming around wearing a pair of fun sunglasses, complete with flowers and umbrellas. She happened to be near us as we sat listening to music and eating our treat, and stopped to say hello. We told her we loved her glasses, and we chatted with her for a bit; her older grandchildren are quite embarrassed now when she wears things that draw attention to her, but Riku told her she was "very pretty". They had a hug and she posed for a photo with him as you will see from their big smiles below. </p>
<p>Riku dozed off on the way home, so Doug stopped in at Berkeley to go to a couple of bookstores. Riku was still sleeping when we got home, and a little cranky from being disturbed when Doug carried him upstairs. He said he did not want to go for pizza, but wanted to stay at our house, but at 5 o'clock we were all at Amici's, and met up with Akane, Bryn, Mirei, and Brent with his parents, Jackie and Brian. Jackie is also Lionel's cousin, something we didn't know until long after Bryn and Brent became good friends here in the city. The pizza was delicious, and the company lots of fun. We talked about family trees, about the city and what they might do on their two-week visit here, and all too soon we were going our separate ways. </p>
<p>Jackie and I made tentative plans to walk through Golden Gate Park tomorrow; shall see how the weather is and how it all pans out. </p>
<p>Mirei was just adorable of course, throughout dinner, doing a little colouring, and when I wasn't giving her enough attention to suit her, calling out "Nana!" in a big voice. I was sitting right next to her. Riku was happy sitting between Brent and his Dad too, and continued to look at his magazines when he wasn't chatting. I had fed him dinner here before leaving, as he hadn't eaten much lunch, so he had lots of time to talk and read. </p>
<p>Doug and I stopped in at Rainbow for some fresh produce and bread, and I was home just at 7 o'clock to meet Gail on Skype as promised for some family tree work. Doug and I watched a one-hour TV show when we finished, and it was off to bed. A busy day but a fun one for us; it just went by too quickly!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/04/a_day_with_jackie.html">A Day with Jackie and a Hampshire Street Evening</a></h2>
								<p>Once again, the plans for my day did not pan out as expected. This is becoming par for the course it seems lately, although almost always the day is enjoyable...  but in a completely unexpected way. </p>
<p>I wanted to walk Finn this morning, but when I called Susan at 9:20, his Oma already had him out for this first nap. Getting up and out of the house for a walk at 9 A.M. seems harder than it should these days. I really must start getting to bed earlier, so that I have more energy first thing in the morning! Rushing about is not very appealing to me right now, especially in the early part of the day. </p>
<p>Last night I had mentioned to Jackie, Brent's mother, that perhaps she and Brian might like to join us on our walk to Stow Lake. They had never done it, and it was supposed to be another gorgeous day. Brian was busy with a household chore for Brent when I called today, but Jackie was more than happy to have plans that included a long walk. I picked her up at Brent's and off we went, parking across from the Flower Conservatory, and continuing along my usual route to the rose garden and on to Stow Lake. Jackie enjoyed it all so much; we are both walkers and our pace was very similar, so the time flew by. </p>
<p>I had hoped to meet up with Susan, her mom, and Finn at the outside café for lunch at the DeYoung Museum in the park, but had only been able to leave a message. Another plan foiled, as the café is closed on Mondays! We waited until just after 12:30 in case they did arrive, but when it was clear that they wouldn't be joining us after all, we set out to find another nice spot for lunch. The little French bakery/cafe in the Haight Street district was also closed on Monday, so I headed back to our own neighbourhood. This was a good idea, since I thought Jackie might enjoy a "California" food experience, and took her to the wonderful "Café Gratitude" I have written about before. It was perfect: not only did Jackie thoroughly enjoy the food, but she got a big kick out of the decor and the theme of this "new age" raw food experience. </p>
<p>We shared a salad: "I Am Satisfied" (mixed organic greens, slivered carrots, beets, tomatoes, sprouts with Brazil nut "Parmesan", and sesame seeds). The restaurant is strictly vegan. The salad was delicious, and we both enjoyed my favourite "I Am Graceful" warm bowl of steamed quinoa and pesto with fresh hemp seed pesto, tomatoes, and sprouts. We also shared a slice of key lime pie, with a wonderful macadamia nut and coconut crust, held together by soaked "Irish moss", a natural thickener. It was all <em>so</em> good.</p>
<p>We dashed back over to the other side of town to pick up Riku from school. Jackie got to see his classroom and teacher, and he gave her a big happy smile when he spotted her. He agreed to sing her a couple of songs in Japanese, at her request, and was pretty silly on the way back to Brent's, but was asleep by the time we got there. </p>
<p>Rather than take home such a sleepy and newly awakened fellow, I brought him home with me. Doug lay him down on the bed, and I took off his shoes, but he was awake almost instantly and we just giggled away, snuggling and cuddling, until he was ready to get up and do some drawing. Instead he tidied up the little desk in the kitchen (Mirei doesn't leave it tidied up at all and it bothers him to see pencil crayons in the wrong places, paper scattered about, etc.), and then decided he would make us "dinner". Riku asked if he could use a white pillowcase as a table cloth which was fine, and then every few minutes would call out that dinner would be "ready in a few minutes" or "dinner will be ready very soon!" </p>
<p>He had it all set up so nicely for us; he has always had this knack for proper table setting... it's an interesting trait, I think. When we were called to the table, we both had very different meals laid out for us; they were all plastic foods, of course, and Doug had white rice, a thick slice of white bread, a fried egg, and a piece of cucumber, which they referred to as a pickle. </p>
<p>I had a "veggie" burger... we had had a little discussion about my not eating "hamburger" as he was preparing all of this. His exact words were, "Come on Nana, it's a new taste. You might like it!" but I assured him that I did not want to eat meat. It promptly became a "veggie" burger. I also had a cob of corn, a carrot, and a clump of French fries. We did have another discussion about what foods contain fiber, and are good and not so good for us. We've been talking about this a lot lately. Yup, he's a Dyment! </p>
<p>Oh, we both had drinks too; mine was hot tea with "lots of milk Nana, but you don't like sugar in it right?" Doug got juice since Riku knows he doesn't drink tea or coffee. And because we ate most of our dinners, we got ice cream cones for dessert! Riku didn't eat with us, he just watched over us, hovering, to make sure we had everything we wanted... "You like pepper with that?" What great pleasure he takes in not only making sure that we are enjoying it all, but in just putting it all together for us. Not to mention taking the middle photograph below ... a budding photographer!</p>
<p>He and I walked over to his place at a fairly brisk pace to get there for 5:30. It is always a pleasure to walk with Riku; he points out everything that catches his attention... a contrail, some birds eating seeds on the lawns, and commenting on it all. We both said hello to the friendly man at the garage on the corner of Potrero Avenue, and he greeted his sister with big hugs and kisses and she returned his enthusiasm with big smiles and beams for me too. </p>
<p>Bryn left with Akane at 5:45 for her third last class in Cantonese, and I sat at the table and fed the children the dinner Akane had left for them. When Bryn returned we both sat with them, talking, bragging, and entertaining them, a very easy thing to do with these two. Mirei had lots of arm actions going as she looked at one of her favourite song books, with hands over her head and swaying from side to side. </p>
<p>Bryn wanted to show me how she is learning her letters, so put six or seven magnetic letters on her tray and asked her where the O was. She immediately picked it up! Then came a K and they had all been mixed up both times. Riku is very proud of her and says "good girl" when she gets it right. Oh, she'll be learning them all before long is my guess, with all this support and encouragement! </p>
<p>I got Riku ready for bed, reading him two stories, and Bryn got Mirei into her PJs, ready for her bed too. She hadn't napped enough today, and could barely keep her eyes open. Riku started coughing in bed, and it was just after 8 before he finally stopped and fell into a sleep. Mirei had fallen asleep much earlier. </p>
<p>Doug arrived with a burrito for his dinner; Bryn had eaten a big lunch, and I finished off the last of the children's whole wheat gnocchi. We sat at the table and heard about Bryn's and Akane's summer plans... two weeks in Japan at the end of July and then a month in Beijing, with a full-time nanny speaking Mandarin to Akane and the children, while Bryn works. It will be an exciting adventure, but it's going to be a long summer for me, with so little contact with them, especially with my trip to Ontario tacked on at the end of it all. </p>
<p>I was really really tired at the end of this day; I could barely keep my eyes open for the one hour taped show we watched... and in fact didn't, and had to replay ten minutes of it again. Lights out at 11 o'clock. </p>
