								<h2>Our Three-Breakfast Girl!</h2>
								<p>OK, we have a major eater on our hands!  Here is a sampling of just some of the food she took in this morning! </p>
<p>#1 at home with her Dad: blueberries, a few large ones, bitten in half to a) taste test them, then discard, b) eat half, and pass the other half to her dad, or c) swallow both sides. Then some Os... healthier Cheerio-type cereal, some fried rice, and mu shu chicken. </p>
<p>#2 at Nana's: 2 scrambled eggs, eaten very proficiently with a tiny fork that used to be Auntie Kelly's. </p>
<p>#3 an hour later: generous bowl of oatmeal with added blueberries and mashed banana. </p>
<p>And that did it; Mirei was full enough to sleep by 11 A.M. After thoroughly taking apart her kitchen, desperately wanting the toy "silverware" drawer to add to the mess, and some busy time with the basket of toys, Mirei was exhausted... finally. She was awake at 6:10 this morning, having slept right through (except for two insignificant calling outs),  so was really a very tired girl at 10.  She napped for two and a quarter hours. </p>
<p>She ate a big lunch, of course(!), of udon noodles in broth with carrots, spinach, and zucchini, followed by a cup of custard with applesauce, and water too. </p>
<p>After some moving around time in the kitchen, we all left for a trip to Noe Valley. I had hoped to get my hair cut, but my favourite stylist is in China on holiday, so I have to put up with this too-long hair for another week. Mirei took our hands while we walked to the car, saw lots of dogs, and window shopped with Grandpa for a few minutes. </p>
<p>From there we took her to the playground at the top of the hill. She was close to falling asleep in the car, and had only been awake for three hours, but she was as pleased as punch to be in the swing again, and sliding down the slide into her Grandpa's arms, and digging in the sand for a little bit too. </p>
<p>Came home to a message from Bryn letting me know the two of them are off for a dinner date with Mari. I topped Mirei up with some bagel, apple slices, and soy milk, and off they went at 5:30 together. </p>
<p>Doug left for T'ai Chi; I made tea, and sat in the living room catching up on all the papers from the past three days, and then entered some names in my family tree. I'm way behind, although do have them in another file. Doug watched a James Bond movie, while I worked away on various things down here. It was good to have the time to catch up a bit. </p>
<p>Quiet email day today. I am still hovering at that 200 mark, no matter how many emails I manage to get answered in a day. Still, lovely to hear from everyone, so I'm not complaining. </p>
<p>I had sent off a few emails of Riku, and Kelly wrote to say how amazed she was to see <em>her<br />
 </em> Bryn in him! Vicki, a friend of many years, wrote to say she could see his father in him a lot now, and Akane told Bryn that she thinks Mirei is looking so much like Riku. What fun to see all these family lines in their little faces! </p>
<p>Oh, Mirei was walking about 97% of the time today! </p>
<p>Off to bed at 10:50 P.M., my earliest night in a long time.</p>
