								<h2>Happy Easter! ... and "The Best Girl Ever"!</h2>
								<p>Yup, that's what Mirei's dad told me tonight, after he had her home and all tucked in for the night. That comment was followed with this one: "a cross between Ghandi and Rambo". I would say that this is a very good description of this little girl; she's a character for sure, and my mom would have said many times over by now that she must have been around this way before! </p>
<p>Bryn is very proud of this little girl, and takes such pleasure in all her antics. As soon as they left for the evening, he phoned to tell me that she had been waving to us in the car, as we stood waving to her from the front window, and she said "bye bye" too, all on her own, with no prompting. This happened the other night as well, so I guess Mirei has the traditional Dyment tradition of saying goodbye down pat.. </p>
<p>I had a very lazy awakening today; I was awake at 7 o'clock but stayed in bed until 8:10, finishing off my book. It was a page turner and I shall take it home for my sisters to read, and then to Toronto for Kelly at some point. Mirei arrived with her dad as I was checking my email, just ten minutes after I put my feet on the floor. They had been to "Jim's" restaurant for breakfast, where Miss Mirei charmed the crowd. Of course. </p>
<p>Mirei ate a third breakfast along with me at the table, a little while after they arrived, while Bryn kept us company. I didn't get the paper read, come to think of it, and didn't get yesterday's read either! Egad! I love my paper ritual and being two days behind is not a good way to start my week. </p>
<p>Mark called to ask some questions about the depth of information I have asked him to get from his parents on the Feldmann side of the family. One day Bryn and Caillie may be very happy that I did this for them, a gift they may (or may not) appreciate when they are in their later years. Of course perhaps by then, it won't be such a struggle to find this information but with all their grandparents alive and well, this is the time to be looking for any missing links. </p>
<p>I didn't speak with the children, as they are home with Hans for Easter this year, much to my surprise. They always, except for one year, I believe, have spent this holiday with Hans, Mark, and their parents. They plan to go up next weekend, so Mrs. Feldmann's Easter egg tree will remain up until then. Hans Sr. told me that Manitou and Wiki are having a grand Easter holiday, chasing into the woods and back at their leisure. </p>
<p>Bryn and Doug left for a three-and-a-half-hour movie at 10 A.M. Mirei fought the first attempt at napping, got up and ate the rest of her cereal plus most of a yogurt, and was then asleep in my arms within minutes. She slept for a solid two hours and was awake in her bed, quietly moving around, for another twenty. By the time she called out to me, she was up and moving again, throwing herself around as she so loves to do, and just making me smile over and over. </p>
<p>Gail and I had worked on our family tree while she was sleeping, and we got lots done. Gail had a few new bits of information and we continued checking each other's work which is slow going, but worth doing nonetheless. </p>
<p>Mirei ate a good-sized lunch, and we sat looking at photos in magazines until she had polished off most of her mac' and cheese with carrots, custard, and strawberries. She had a little walking around/destroying the kitchen time, both before and after lunch, and then it was off with her dad to run some errands. At three o'clock they went for groceries and then hung out at a café, enjoying our warm sunny day, while I did some dinner preps, and managed to get in a little more time with Gail. </p>
<p>Bryn and Mirei arrived back at 5:45, just as I was getting dinner ready to go on the table. They had time for some peek-a-boo antics in the kitchen... lots of photos of this coming soon in her online album, and some big laughs while she played with his hat. What fun they have together; he just beams at her, and many admiring glances are passed between them. </p>
<p>For dinner we had baked wild salmon, baked sweet potatoes, fresh green beans, creamed corn for the guys (Mirei doesn't seem to care for it any more than I do), and sliced tomatoes, with carrot sticks as well. Mirei ate very well, using her spoon ever so well, for more mac' and cheese, sautéed spinach, which she really likes so much, many bites of salmon from both her dad and me, and hard boiled egg whites, which she polished off with vigour. A little custard for dessert, but her tummy was full, and she lost interest when she heard the words "bath time"! </p>
<p>Bryn looked at my family tree while I was sitting at the tub with Mirei, clicked on his dad's name and came up with several "hits" from the Web site. Later on I found out one piece of information that might be worthwhile on his maternal grandmother's side. Yahoo! </p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was shampooing Mirei's hair. She is the funniest little girl. The minute I get the shampoo on her head, she puts her hand up and starts rubbing and washing along with me. As soon as she can get hold of the bottle, she puts it up and pretends to be pouring in on her hair herself. More and more we see this independent streak in her. Mirei is struggling so hard to get up on my bed, and the chesterfield on her own, as well as the bed she sleeps on. She can almost do all three, but not quite, but every day she gives it a shot just in case today's the day. The other day Bryn told me she had attempted to pull his hat on his head, really working to get the tight cap over his skull. I'm sure we are going to see lots of this strong will in action in the coming years! </p>
<p>Mirei was in her sleepers when she kissed us all goodbye, and waved to us. Minutes later Bryn let me know she was already asleep, a second day in a row with no second nap. However, she slept for ten solid hours in a row last night, from 8:30 to 6:30 this morning, and was a happy girl throughout the entire day. </p>
<p>I got right to work on Doug's family tree, and because of all the research someone in his family has done on that site over the years — there are two Dyment books on their family history already going back to the early 1500s — it was a cinch to just click on each link and add them in. If they are in Devon (Devonshire), or specifically Bradworthy, the town where they lived closest to, and if their names were anything close to Dyment — Daymen, Dyeman, or the like — then they are related and in they went! To think how Gail and I have struggled to find just one link, this was child's play and so much fun. </p>
<p>That was my day... a lovely relaxing Easter Day. Bed at 11 o'clock, and I'm off to choose my next book... always a treat! as I have a huge number to choose from these days.</p>
