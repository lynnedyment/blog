								<h2>Ukuleles and Pizza</h2>
								<p>Today disappeared in a flash; most of our Sundays seem longer, as often we spend the day at home. I can always use a full day here to catch up on all the things that were neglected during the week, like emails and blogs and photos, but today we were out the door at 10:30. We picked Riku up and drove to Hayward for a ukulele festival. Riku was recovering from his high fever from late yesterday, so sat in the back seat quietly reading on his own, flipping through some Ultraman comics and catalogues he brought back from Japan. We thought that sitting and listening might be fun for him, and it was for a while. Mostly he sat on my lap looking through his magazines, looking up whenever a more lively piece caught his ear. </p>
<p>We wandered outside in the sunshine for a bit when he was ready to stretch his legs; we sat and had a "picnic" and watched the crowds, gaily done up in Hawai'ian costume with leis and bright flowers everywhere. </p>
<p>Doug was disappointed that there was not more diversity in the ukulele playing (it was more a Hawai'ian festival than a ukulele one), so we left around 1 o'clock, stopping first to buy candy floss for Riku. We had promised him some at Pier 39 last month, and then didn't see any as we continued walking, so today was to make up for that promise. It didn't come in the familiar plastic bag, but in a plastic container and made into flat circles(!) ... the first time we had seen it this way. It was handy though, but after a mere half a circle Riku said his tummy felt funny and he had had enough. He's not used to much sugar, and it's great that he knows it doesn't make him feel so well. </p>
<p>There was a wonderful older woman roaming around wearing a pair of fun sunglasses, complete with flowers and umbrellas. She happened to be near us as we sat listening to music and eating our treat, and stopped to say hello. We told her we loved her glasses, and we chatted with her for a bit; her older grandchildren are quite embarrassed now when she wears things that draw attention to her, but Riku told her she was "very pretty". They had a hug and she posed for a photo with him as you will see from their big smiles below. </p>
<p>Riku dozed off on the way home, so Doug stopped in at Berkeley to go to a couple of bookstores. Riku was still sleeping when we got home, and a little cranky from being disturbed when Doug carried him upstairs. He said he did not want to go for pizza, but wanted to stay at our house, but at 5 o'clock we were all at Amici's, and met up with Akane, Bryn, Mirei, and Brent with his parents, Jackie and Brian. Jackie is also Lionel's cousin, something we didn't know until long after Bryn and Brent became good friends here in the city. The pizza was delicious, and the company lots of fun. We talked about family trees, about the city and what they might do on their two-week visit here, and all too soon we were going our separate ways. </p>
<p>Jackie and I made tentative plans to walk through Golden Gate Park tomorrow; shall see how the weather is and how it all pans out. </p>
<p>Mirei was just adorable of course, throughout dinner, doing a little colouring, and when I wasn't giving her enough attention to suit her, calling out "Nana!" in a big voice. I was sitting right next to her. Riku was happy sitting between Brent and his Dad too, and continued to look at his magazines when he wasn't chatting. I had fed him dinner here before leaving, as he hadn't eaten much lunch, so he had lots of time to talk and read. </p>
<p>Doug and I stopped in at Rainbow for some fresh produce and bread, and I was home just at 7 o'clock to meet Gail on Skype as promised for some family tree work. Doug and I watched a one-hour TV show when we finished, and it was off to bed. A busy day but a fun one for us; it just went by too quickly!</p>
