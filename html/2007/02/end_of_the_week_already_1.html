								<h2>End of the Week... Already!</h2>
								<p>The week flew by; Monday seems like yesterday and it's here already again tomorrow. I need a day with more hours to get even half the things done that I want to get done. Today disappeared too, and the hours are gone. It's bedtime.</p>
<p>Doug and I both slept until 8 o'clock, very unusual for both of us. I had my shower and dressed immediately, expecting that Mirei would be here with Bryn at any moment. He was off to the office to do some contractual work, and so I had volunteered to have either Riku or Mirei for the morning. They arrived at 8:30. Mirei has a new cold, poor babe, and her nose was running the entire visit. She had half the normal amount of oatmeal this morning, but it gave her enough energy to empty out the one kitchen drawer of elastics and twist-ties, another of cookie cutters, and two cupboards of plastic bags and dry foods. It is funny to see as it really looks as though they are tasks she has undertaken... as soon as one is done to her satisfaction, on she moves to the next. </p>
<p>I expected that she would have an extra long nap, and had barely started reading the morning paper, when she woke after just forty minutes. Her cold obviously had stopped her from breathing well, and she woke unhappy and needy, but would not go back down. I held her for a few minutes, hoping she would settle, but she cried hard until I whispered, asking her if she would like some water. She instantly stopped and looked up at me, obviously completely understanding that it meant leaving the room. So I dressed her, while she remained quiet, but was not happy when I tried to put her down for even a minute. Doug walked her around for a few minutes, her second walkabout of the short morning, and I prepared my breakfast, which I ate while feeding her a little fruit and vanilla soymilk, which she clearly enjoys, always signing for "more". </p>
<p>She needed more sleep, and as I was not convinced she was going to be happy going back to bed, a stroller ride was called for; I quickly made up a banana bread, while she emptied out some cupboards for the second time today, and we were off to meet Akane and Riku at the playground. We met them at 23rd and Folsom, with Riku on his tricycle, wearing his new helmet, looking oh-so-cute. That playground was closed, no doubt due to the heavy rains that had soaked the playing field there, so off we traveled to  the mini playground on 24th. Mirei had not fallen asleep immediately as I had thought she would; since I had her sitting up more for comfort with her nose, she was able to see trees, dogs, people, and birds, so it took her longer than usual. However, she had a good hour in before Doug picked me up for a double feature, starting at 2:20. </p>
<p>When we first met, I had said to Riku that I had missed him; I didn't see him yesterday and his answer was that he didn't miss me 'cause he saw me all the time. True. He also told me he had made me "something beautiful 'cause you like beautiful things." Also true. </p>
<p>I dashed off to buy an egg salad sandwich to eat in the theatre, and there I sat for four hours while we watched a Chinese movie ("Curse of the Golden Flower") starring Gong Li, beautifully done, a visual treat, and up for a costume design Academy Award this year, as well as "Little Children", with Kate Winslet nominated as best actress, as well two other nominations for the film. It was a movie I wasn't even tempted to sleep through, a tense fast-paced story. </p>
<p>Home for a quick dinner, finally got to read yesterday and today's papers, had my tea, cleared up the kitchen, watched a rented short HBO TV show "The Wire" with Doug, and that was my day... here and gone! </p>
<p>Bryn popped in to say hello and goodnight after a ping pong session; they had a little visit with the Doering/Ellis family after I left Akane with the children in the park, and Bryn got to hold little Finn again. </p>
<p>Bed at 11:30 tonight, my earliest night this week, and without having done a thing on the family tree all day.</p>
