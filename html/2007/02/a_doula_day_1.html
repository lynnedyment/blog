								<h2>A Doula Day ... and Tub Time at Hampshire Street</h2>
								<p>My day started out in a very special way, as Riku had joined me for breakfast at 8:15, a rare and special treat. He and I both had oatmeal with fruit and almonds, and then there was time for a balloon toss in the hallway for about fifteen minutes. It was a good excuse to get up and in the shower immediately, instead of puttering about on the computer for a while. </p>
<p>The timing was perfect as today was a very exciting day for me. After lots of preparation to become a doula, and having participated in a doula capacity for four grandchildren, I finally got to the next step and volunteered as a doula at the S.F. General hospital. I've been going to the meetings, reading all the emails to keep up with the local SFGH doula news but, with life so busy in general, I just hadn't signed up for a regular shift. I had, however, put my name on the <em>call</em> list, and today was here when they needed a doula. </p>
<p>The labouring mom was  5 cm dilated when they called at 11;15 A.M. and by the time I arrived fifteen minutes later she was at 6. I was sorry to hear she had been there on her own since 8 o'clock. Since she really needed some support once her labour intensified, she asked the staff to call a social worker she has some contact with, so this gal was there when I arrived. </p>
<p>We made a good team. We were on each side of the mom, with me stroking her back and arms, or rubbing her lower back, while the other gal gave her water and held cold cloths to her head. Having a baby is hard work, and she was in a lot of pain, but handled it all very well. She was so responsive to suggestions about relaxing between contractions and then blowing her way through them; it was good to see the change take place. End labour was very fast and at 1 p.m. she delivered a beautiful baby boy, a brother for two young sisters. </p>
<p>I took some photos of them, and stayed with her for a half hour before saying goodbye. The baby was still nestled on her chest, nursing happily, and with a very happy smiling mommy. How wonderful it see the baby not whisked away for eye drops, a bath, weighing, measuring, etc. but instead got to snuggle in skin to skin next to his mommy, and would be allowed to stay there for as long as she chose. They wiped him off and cut the cord so that he wasn't away from her for more than a few minutes, and still right there beside her. I was on such a high coming home! I was also so astonished at how grateful the staff was to have me there. I left with big smiles and many thanks for my help, but as Amelia says "it was my pleasure!" and it was. </p>
<p>Mirei arrived just fifteen minutes after I stepped in the door, smiling too, but tired. She had a big bowl of oatmeal with Akane's homemade applesauce, and was tucked snugly into bed at 2:30, sleeping for an hour and a half. </p>
<p>The rest of the day flew by... while she napped, Gail and I worked on the family tree, adding some information Gail had discovered earlier today. What a nice little break this was in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>Mirei woke and I fed her and watched her as she puddled about the kitchen. She was a little off kilter today somehow, crying when I went into the laundry room and not responding in quite the same way to her usual walkabout with Grandpa. However, all in all, she was a happy girl, just not quite herself. </p>
<p>Instead of meeting Akane and Riku in the playground as planned, I decided to give Mirei some extra food before we headed to Hampshire Street at 5:20. Bryn stopped by for his mail as we were leaving, and Mirei and I had a very brisk stroller ride home; this gave her just enough time for some nursing with her mommy. </p>
<p>While Bryn drove Akane to class, I sat with the children while they ate the dinner that Akane had prepared... pasta with tomato sauce for them both, and with added veggies for Riku on the side. They both ate every bite of it, and of course Mirei still got topped up twice more before bedtime. </p>
<p>Once Bryn was home, we bathed the children; Bryn washed Riku's hair first and then Mirei joined him in the tub. She got all excited when I told her "splash, splash, splash" as I always did for Riku at that stage, and just like him she started smacking her hand up and down, letting me know she "got" it. </p>
<p>What an adorable twosome they are in the tub together! Riku is so careful not to splash his sister, and was sweetly advising her not to worry when I was washing her hair, that Nana would be careful and she would be okay. He made sure she had lots of toys, and chatted to her as though expecting an answer. She loves him so much, and leans forward to give him a nuzzle oh so often. She might have the best big brother in the known universe. Lucky girl, that Mirei. Of course I took photos. </p>
<p>We got them into pj's, with Riku asleep at 7:35, and Mirei tucked in at 8:45. She got to play in the living room between her two extra meals. She had joined Grandpa, her dad, and me for the second meal, eating as many pinto beans as she could talk Doug and Bryn out of, and settling for my black beans when their supply ran short. </p>
<p>Note from Bryn the other day: Bryn says: "Mirei continues to impress us with her food choices. <br />
pickled ginger slices, Japanese pickles, black beans with hot salsa not entirely wiped off. Riku asleep. Mirei fed and happy."</p>
<p>After Bryn picked Akane up at 9 o'clock, we went home for Doug to finish his packing for the too early trip to Chicago tomorrow morning and after checking email we went off to bed, turning out the light at 10:30. It was a busy productive day and I even annotated some photos... at last. </p>
