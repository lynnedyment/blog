								<h2>Happy Valentine's Day, and Congratulations to Bryn and Caillie!</h2>
								<p>It was a chocolate day for sure around here, with a box of four Joseph Schmidt chocolates on my computer from Doug, a box of creamy tiny Joseph Schmidt truffles from Amelia, and yet a third box of wee Swiss truffles chocolates from Akane and Bryn, when they returned from their dinner out. Yum!</p>
<p>And today was also the day Riku was to have his root canal done; I didn't sleep well anticipating the pain he might be in, and was glad Doug agreed to go with us to the appointment, just in case he needed me in the back seat with him on the way home. However, it was needless worry, since he was congested enough and coughing enough, that the very kind Dr. Wong decided that he would hold off doing the root canal work, and just take the extra two X-rays Riku still needed. This worked well, as he had him hooked up to laughing gas, via mouth, and that certainly did relax him. He got used to breathing that in, while he watched a video, and the two X-rays turned out fine... no upset, and a good experience to leave the office with today. The two kind staff members, Dr. Wong, and I all cheered when they were done, so the next trip won't be so filled with anxiety for Riku. He was worried about having those pictures done.</p>
<p>He and Grandpa did some chasing/running to the bakery to buy a cookie each, and Riku fell asleep fairly quickly in the car, holding my hand. He dozed for about a half hour and then we came in to the house to eat. It was lovely having him here during an entire afternoon with me. We watched some new Caillou episodes, made swords with our legs and "battled", and had a picnic on our bed upstairs, just for a treat.</p>
<p>Of course we needed some fresh air and exercise, and I didn't want him running around with his cough, so we cleaned the yard. It was great fun; we both swept, Riku climbed up on the top level and pulled weeds and threw down big branches onto the pile we had made a week or more ago, and I put about half of the leaves, branches, etc. into the composting container for recycling. There is enough there for a second container for next week. Riku came in with rosy cheeks, wanting some hot chocolate and then dinner; he's a hungry boy.</p>
<p>I took advantage of the moment of time on my own to call the Toronto children; I spoke with them all but Bryn, who was at his swimming lesson. It was too bad I missed him, as Kelly had told me earlier that both he and Caillie had passed their first piano examination! What exciting news this was, as I hadn't known they had taken it. I learned that Bryant is taking a mixed class of guitar and piano, that  Myk' had been to a Valentine dance after school, which was lots of fun, and that a boy in Caillie's class has a crush on her and gave her a "bear love" card while all the other children received frogs with "ribbit"  on them and one other equally non-romantic. Caillie was a little embarrassed by the card but I'm sure very pleased as well.</p>
<p>Riku did some drawing while I made a chunky pasta sauce for dinner, along with steamed carrots and broccoli. Bryn and Akane arrived with Mirei at 5:15 and left for their Chinese dinner in a new spot fifteen minutes later. Bryn's ping pong teacher was going to be there too, and Bryn was looking forward to introducing her to Akane.</p>
<p>Mirei sat happily at the table with us, munching on broccoli and the bow pasta Riku had chosen. She was, as always, being a good little eater, but kept pointing at the bookshelves. Riku was so sweet, telling me that she had finished with one thing and wanted something else. Then, one minute later, he would say "Oh Nana, Mirei wants the bird now. She is tired of that chicken."</p>
<p>Mirei astounds us all with all the ways she can communicate... new words, old concepts, all with those astounding expressive eyebrows of hers, the flirtatious look, and the signing she has learned. When I asked if she wanted a bath, she made "splashing" motions, with a big smile that said "YES!". The clock chimes and Mirei rocks from side to side, with her index finger in the air keeping pace. Bryn likes to ask her if he should drop something on the floor, just to see her shake her head seriously at him, with those eyebrows raised, letting him know that is not a good idea. She flutters her little hands up and down above her waist to let me know her slippers have butterflies on them, as does the wall hanging from Auntie Sandy... a gift to Auntie Kelly when she was a baby. When the trees are blowing, Mirei's hands go above her head and drift side to side, along with a little whooshing sound, to let us know she noticed. We say "hat" and her hands go on her head, and asked if it is sleepy time, she puts her index finger to her lips to say "shhhh". This is my favourite of all. She will often do it on her own too. Last week I taught her to pretend she was using a straw, with her fingers joined together at her mouth, to let me know she was thirsty; it just amazes me to see how quickly she picks these things up. Last week we saw a bee in the back yard and now she moves her fingers up and down very quickly... like a fast "butterfly" motion to let me know what we saw. It's such fun for us and obviously for her too.</p>
<p>Bath time with the two children in the tub was just such fun. Riku went in first, so I could take some photos of Mirei standing beside the tub, and we both laughed to see that little leg of hers trying hard to get in there with him. Mirei is very comfortable in the water, swirling around to chase the bubbles I blew for her for the first time. However, she doesn't like to be tipped down to have her hair washed and once more Riku comes to her rescue telling her I will be very careful and not get water in her eyes.</p>
<p>Of course the favourite part of the tub for Riku is being wrapped in a big towel, warm from the dryer. I took Mirei out first and she obviously likes it too; we have a nice cuddle before laying flat to have a little massage with body lotion, and Mirei looked adorable in her brother's pale green sleepers from Japan.</p>
<p>Riku always says, without fail, each time I lift him out of the tub and have him snuggled in my arms in the towel, "This is our favourite part."... and it is indeed. He had his glow-in-the-dark bug PJs on tonight and looked ever so young. Doug kept an eye on Mirei, who kept busy pulling apart the dry goods cupboard and the elastic/twist tie drawers, while I read to Riku.</p>
<p>He was asleep at 7:40, and when I walked out of the room, Bryn was holding his newly bathed girl in his arms. He always loves the way her skin feels after a tub and she adores her daddy anytime at all!</p>
<p>They left me with a bowl of my favourite braised bean curd and big black mushrooms for lunch tomorrow. I got busy cleaning up my very messy kitchen, cleared away some paper work, sat and read the paper in the living room with my hot tea, and wrote a couple of short emails before heading to bed at 11:30. I am so far behind in them that I feel guilty every time I look at my in-box.</p>
<p>It was a very busy day and stressful as I had worried about this appointment for Riku last night, not sleeping well in the process. Tonight will be much better for certain!</p>
