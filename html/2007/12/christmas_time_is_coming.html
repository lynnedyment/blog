								<h2>Christmas Time is Coming!</h2>
								<p>.. and there is one little boy in our family who is very excited about it! Riku is so totally smitten with the whole idea of Christmas. He was eating dinner with me tonight and told me he "loved my house". I asked what he liked best about it, and he went full tilt into a long list with no hesitation. It went something like this: "I love your Christmas tree, and the Santa in the dining room, and the snowman on the door, and the things on the shelves, and the things in the bathroom and on the door knob, and I love the lights and the decorations on the tree, and the decorations on all the windows, and the Christmas songs, and I LOVE gingerbread men the best!" He claims that he likes them even more than Grandpa or his Dad but that is hard to imagine. It makes me feel so good to know that he is such a happy boy and so enthusiastic about the whole idea of Christmas, my favourite holiday too. </p>
<p>Mirei rang the doorbell at 8:45 this morning; her dad had just dropped Akane and Riku off at school. I had big plans with Mirei for our morning together... a trip to Noe Valley on the bus! I was all set to go when she arrived, and we headed off to the bus stop shortly after 9 o'clock. It's only a block away, and we walked slowly down the hill, and then got to the bottom of it and waited and waited and waited. I gave up at 10:15, knowing if the bus came instantly at that point I would have trouble being back here at 11:30 or so for Akane, who was going to pick her up about that time. </p>
<p>Instead, she ended up kicking dry leaves for more than a half hour before coming back into the house, which pleased her no end, and since Akane phoned with a change of plans, II ended up having her with me for the afternoon as well.. She was her usual busy self, which these days means that she inspects the tree, gently touches a few decorations, and puts her babies to bed in the new cradle, after walking her/them around in the baby stroller. </p>
<p>Akane walked back over at 2:15 to sit here while Mirei was sleeping, and I walked up the hill to pick Riku up from school. He is in a brand new walking-home entertainment mode now. He tells me all the things he can think of that start with a specific letter. I'm amazed at how quickly he is picking up on this, as he was trying to sound words out in September, but now he is hardly ever wrong, except for those random weird English words that should start with one letter, and don't. He kept this up all the way home too, one word after another, and obviously enjoyed it. Riku is a very happy little learner! </p>
<p>Mirei was just waking as I was leaving;when we got home Akane said she was out of sorts when she went in to pick her up a few minutes later, and that after a two and a half hour nap! Apparently she was walking around looking and asking for me, and for the rest of the time with me, she was very clingy, wanting to be picked up a lot for hugs, and kissing my hand as she walked by. </p>
<p>She and Riku opened a door on the Advent calendars that Susan had picked up for them yesterday, and both were thrilled to bits with the tiny chocolate discs they discovered. Together they kept busy playing happily together with the stroller and the cradle, complete with a back pack for "daddy" Riku and a bag and a purse for "mommy" Mirei. They are adorable together and play so well.Riku is good at knowing how to trade off for something that Mirei wants to take from him too, something that first children often figure out fairly quickly. </p>
<p>Akane and Mirei left for home around 4 o'clock, so I got Riku into a bubble bath right away, we had an early dinner... using some of Soo's home made veggie potstickers made just for Doug and me. They are so good! </p>
<p>Riku spent some time hanging up extra Christmas decorations in unlikely places... on doorknobs, on dresser drawer knobs, and leaning up against the wall behind the sofa. I guess his motto is there can never be too many decorations! </p>
<p>Riku was asleep at 7:30 after a total of five books, four of them his new belated birthday gifts from Auntie Candy and Uncle Rick... a series of early reading books called "Henry and Mudge" which Riku thoroughly enjoys. For the second time this week, I fell asleep with him!, and woke at 8:15 feeling just like Mirei must have, groggy and out of it! </p>
<p>I went off to bed at 11 P.M. </p>
