								<h2>Needles, School News, and Thank You!</h2>
								<p>Ah, I am so glad I made an appointment with Valerie, my acupuncturist of long standing. At one point, when Doug was working steadily, I would go for a "tune up" on a thrice yearly basis at least, but now I only see the miracle-worker when I have a physical problem that won't go away. This time it was my left hip area below my waist. Monday night, on our way to a movie, I was in real pain and yesterday morning I made the call. Tonight, even though I am a little sore, I truly feel like a new woman. I was with her for two hours, had dozens of needles put into my hip, along my spine, in my ankles, feet, hands, head, and wrists, and then lay there in utter contentment, in a dark warm room, with no lights and quiet music. Ahhh, bliss. This was followed by a lovely back rub with liniment, and by this afternoon I found myself bending over with no pain! </p>
<p>This made my six-minute walk to pick Riku up from school a very pleasant experience. He waved to me with a big wave and a huge smile from across the courtyard, and then came running. It is such a pleasure to walk home with him, as he chats away about all the things that happened during his day. I know it's not always typical for children to do this, and I am so pleased that Riku does. I learned that the little boy who has pushed him twice is now his friend, that he knows all the children's names in his class, including one new girl, I believe, with a very complicated name. He had to have me say it twice before I got it. </p>
<p>Tonight was Riku's first sleepover since early July when they left for Japan, and we fell right into our old routine. We sat upstairs and watched a few "Casper, the Friendly Ghost" episodes while he ate a nice big snack of apples, banana, strawberry, one fig newton, and a container of chocolate soy milk too. Then he spent some time on his own in the little bedroom the children sleep in, playing with the toys that "my cousin Bryn" had sent home for him. He spent some time looking at a book on his own in the living room, and did a painting at the table with brushes, experimenting with colour combinations and the results of mixing them. Next came dragging around a "very long" piece of connecting rods that he had made two days ago, and this too kept him busy on his own. </p>
<p>After his bath and dinner, Riku told me he wanted to send a card to Bryn to thank him for the bag of "presents". These were cleared out of Bryn's room when I was there, and it is an interesting varied collection of whatnots, all fascinating to Riku. When I gave it to him on Sunday night, the first thing he said after having a good look at it all was, "I should write Bryn a letter to say 'thank you.'" I was really pleased to hear this, as it hadn't been suggested to him at all, and then tonight when he mentioned it again, he chose a card and got right to it. He told me what he wanted to say, keeping it very brief, as the card wasn't very big. And of course he drew a picture too. He told me he thought that Bryn would be "very happy" when he saw it, and I'm sure he will be. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped by just after 7 P.M. to bring fresh clothes for Riku and to say goodnight. Bryn had whispered to me at one point that "Riku is the best boy in the world." I told Riku it was rude to whisper in front of other people, and told him what Bryn had said. As Bryn was walking out the door, Riku told me he had a "secret", leaning over to whisper in my ear, "Let's sleep together tonight and not tell Daddy!" This was so funny to me, as I always do when he's here... my bedroom is on another floor, but he has been going to sleep on his own and sleeping on his own too, and was no doubt thinking I might try to instill the same rule here. What a guy! </p>
<p>Riku tucked in and asleep by 7:45, Doug back from his day in Petaluma at 9:30, and I am heading for bed early tonight, as my 6 A.M. wakenings are not something I am enjoying, despite giving me a little time with Gail this morning to add a new member to the family tree. </p>
