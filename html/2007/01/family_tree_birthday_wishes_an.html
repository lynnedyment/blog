								<h2>Bug,  Birthday Wishes, and a Broken Heart</h2>
								<p>Well, I have the bug again... the family tree bug, that is! For many years Gail, Candy, and I have been interested in exploring our family history. We have lots of collective memories about past generations, and I have vast amounts of paper bits and notebooks in the house, stuffed with it all. In late November I finally signed up for Ancestry.com, an online family history site. </p>
<p>Gail joined several years ago and whenever I am in Nanaimo with her, we spend time in her office, working for hours each day, and whooping with delight when we confirm yet another date/birth/name. Now that I am signed up... whatever took me so long???? ... we have started working together via Skype, filling in the hundreds of spaces with all that we have collected over the years. </p>
<p>Gail has done a huge amount of work on it on her own, and been very successful. I took lots of notes when Mom and Gram were alive. I connected with a Parcels family member several years ago, who not only did research on our grandmother's side of the family, but on our Rodgers side too... even though he is not related, and Gail just recently connected with a Lee relative now living in Australia. He had a huge collection of family information for us, all collected for his wife, who is the Lee (and was born in Liverpool). </p>
<p>Today was my day to sit here and work with Gail. I had no idea I would spend as many hours sitting on this chair that I did, though, and how I wish I could sit here for another few! I'm hooked, as is Gail. We got so much done together last night, and after Gail went off I continued to look for "siblings unknown" for our great-grandfather... and found a long lost sister! Yahoo! What a high that was, and Gail was just as delighted when she heard. We are just delighted to have new information coming in, from whatever source at all. Finally I can do some searching here as well, and come up with gold too. You can see I'm obsessed. Deep breath. Stop. </p>
<p>I had a surprise visit from Bryn and Riku around the noon hour. I do break for children and grandchildren! Riku and I played "cars" in the little bedroom, racing, and playing bad guys with guns in the cars, when I decided it would be fun for him to make a card for a birthday party he was going to. Campbell, the honoree, is an adult, very sweet with children, and Riku likes her a lot. She was very lucky, receiving an original Riku Dyment hand-coloured card with a colourful pic' on the front, his name signed, with a kiss and hug, and birthday stickers inside and out. There was even time for a design on the back of it. Bryn had him write "Campbell" on the front too, so Riku did it all. Here was the reaction for the recipient: "Thanks for the super cute card.  I loved the sparkles that fell out when I opened it!  Riku is such a cutie..."</p>
<p>Once I was without entertainment, back I went to working along with Gail, until 4:15 when Doug and I left for an early pizza outing at Patxi's Chicago Pizza, with Akane, Mirei, Bryn, and Riku. Riku was at the end of the table by me, and he kept busy with pens and paper, making two pictures for Auntie Kelly. This is her third this week! I get to take photos of them; she gets the originals. Hmmm. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mirei had been sitting between her mom and dad, with Grandpa apparently too far away from her. Bryn realized what was going on, so suggested they switch seats. What a happy little camper she was, as she got to entertain him and be entertained by him. We all love her little flirty moves with him; she puts her head down on the table, looking sideways at him, just waiting for him to put his head down beside hers. It is too cute for words. Akane fed her during all this flirtiness, and she was very happy chewing on the pizza crust once our deep dish pizza arrived. Yum! Riku was happily occupied with one of his favourite pastimes... drawing.</p>
<p>The guys finished up first, so Akane, Mirei, and I took our time finishing up. However, Mirei didn't realize this meant Grandpa would be leaving, and she sat looking at him walking out the door, with a big pout and a look of unbelievable unhappiness on her face, before bursting into tears! What a sad sight. It didn't last long but it was enough that Akane and I knew her heart was broken. </p>
<p>We joined them in a travel store next door, and Mirei was her happy self, being walked around in Doug's arms until... it came time to leave. He tried to pass her over to Akane, and she wasn't having any of it, burying her head in Doug's shoulder and hanging on tight! And then she was sad when I waved goodbye. I think she just doesn't like to see people she loves leave, although this was the very first time we saw her cry... and it was all for Grandpa! </p>
<p>And of course I came back to the family search, sorting out name after name, and being amazed at just how far we have come. We have traced one side of the family back to 1595 in Grenoble, France, and have managed to get to 1804 for the U.K. side, with very little initial information to go on. More to come. I just need to learn to get by on 4 hours sleep a night, and to whiz through my housework in an hour a day. </p>
<p>That's it... thanks to Bryn, who gave me the kick-start I needed! Bedtime... 11 P.M.</p>
