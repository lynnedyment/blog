								<h2>Clap and Wiggle and Two New Teeth!</h2>
								<p>Very early wakening today; Doug woke me at 4:40 as planned for the ten minute drive to the airport. He is off to Waukesha, Kansas until Thursday morning but phoned later to let me know he was delayed in Denver for four hours! I was back home and in bed again at 6 A.M. after writing a couple of emails and heating up two bed buddies. They were the secret to getting back to sleep, along with trying to read a little in a new book. </p>
<p>I spent some time this morning taking photographs of most of our Christmas tree decorations and some of our holiday decorations as well.... things that my children made when they were much younger... Bryn's snowman from kindergarten and "dough" figures we made years later. I would like to make our own Christmas cards next year, or at least some of them, but also thought it would be fun to have an album documenting each one. Gram should always be remembered as the person who gave us the pink popcorn momentos! </p>
<p>Akane rang the doorbell just after 2 o'clock with a sleeping girl in her arms. She hadn't napped all morning, and of course minutes after being put in the stroller she was sound asleep. That was enough to keep her from falling asleep again for me, tired as she was, rubbing her eyes, and looking a little dazed. I prepared her some food, in case that might help, and as always Mirei just polished it all off... a <strong>big</strong> bowl of oatmeal with blueberries, plus a big helping of avocado... perhaps a third of a large one, and finished off with a shortbread cookie and some water. </p>
<p>Today, while sitting there, Mirei and I played the usual games. I asked her where various things were and she would point them out... the brooms, the bird, balloons, which used to hang in the dining room but had been moved to the kitchen last night. Then I raised my hands over my head, as we have been doing for maybe two weeks now, saying "up" as I did so. However, today I also said "wiggle those fingers" and she watched as I did so. The second time her arms went up in the air, she wiggled her fingers too! I am amazed once again by how closely she pays attention and then copies me. She too clapped for herself when I did for her! </p>
<p>Doug is always astounded by how quickly she remembers the things that he points out on their "walkabouts" from room to room. He says he can't forget a thing, or she leans back to point it out to him. If he asks her where "the big man" is, she points immediately to the almost ceiling-high Mountie in the dining room. But, if he doesn't talk about the Mountie's hat, she will put her hand on her own head, and pat it, until he responds and says "yes, hat!" The newest thing he taught her was the mistletoe hanging in the kitchen doorway. She has never forgotten where it is, and points it out each and every time they are in the hallway, even if they are pointing the other way and heading away from it. </p>
<p>One more exciting event today... Mirei has a new tooth! She has had quite swollen gums two teeth away from the bottom centre ones, on both sides, for quite some time. Today, as I was went in to check if the one on her left had broken through, I felt above, and found the edge of a new tooth up there! And when I took her home and told Akane she thought it was the one to the right of her bottom centre tooth, as she cut that one two or three days ago. So, six teeth! It has taken so long for her teeth to come in; even though we know all children cut their teeth at different times, Riku had twelve teeth by this age. Mirei doesn't let that stop her from eating everything in sight though; what an appetite this girl has. </p>
<p>I let her meander around the house for a while, hoping to wear her out a little bit. It is such fun to just watch her putter about, perfectly content entertaining herself with all the things she knows she can touch... and can't.  I was very surprised today when she stopped in front of my computer, obviously thinking about pushing the ever- beckoning flashing green button. I looked at her, and in an "I mean it" voice told her "no"... and watched her move on past without a back glance at it. Wow! </p>
<p>I was putting the usual items on the mantle in the living room, getting the ornaments put away, and Mirei was such a happy little girl, looking at her tiny book on the coffee table, checking out the metal birds that always sat on the hearth, and visiting the folk art chickens that had been moved during Christmas. Once I spotted her rubbing those tired eyes, I tried to put her down for her nap, but I think the little nap and the lack of sleep had thrown her off, so we headed out to the playground in the stroller at 4 o'clock. I don't think it took two minutes for those eyes to close. It was coolish, and she was nicely bundled up, looking as sweet as could be. </p>
<p>Akane and Riku were there, with Riku looking more tired than usual, but it's been a long day for him at this stage of his day. Bryn says he is at his lowest ebb at dinner time, but often rouses during that time. He  was playing in the sandbox when I arrived and as soon as he spotted me, he handed me a lovely single yellow flower "for you Nana!" with a big smile. </p>
<p>Akane took over the stroller and headed off for a walk, as the playground is too noisy. Mirei would waken immediately to see what she was missing! Riku played with a little boy in the sandbox and then they chased each other around, while his mom and I chatted. When Riku spotted the mom with a baby, he went right up to her and said "Your baby is very cute. How old is she?" He was told three months, and then turned to me to let me know. Later on he asked her name... Ava, and then introduced himself to Ava's mom, telling her his name and his age too, as well as the fact that he had a sister and her name is Mirei, and she is one year old. What a guy he is... Mr. Sociable! Akane laughed when I told her and said he sounded like me. I suppose he does... not a bad thing.  :) The mom, Merissa, is from Dublin and I quite enjoyed her lovely accent as we talked. </p>
<p>Akane returned with a still sleeping Mirei at 5:10, but shortly after Mirei opened those eyes, still looking very tired. Riku gave her a big hug, and then we headed for home. We all did a little running, and Riku insisted on holding hands with his mom and me both, telling us he loved all of us! He said "I love everyone in the whole city." </p>
<p>Once at home, he tried his best to get me to stay to watch his newest Ultraman DVD; when I told him I had to go home, he suggested I just watch a little bit with him, and then said I could stay and babysit him, and tuck him into bed, and say "Goodnight Riku" and then go home! He sure had lots of great ideas, but all the chores awaiting me at home had me out the door, just in time to meet Bryn coming in. </p>
<p>Home for a "scramble" for dinner... mushrooms, eggs, and tomatoes, with toast, and a hot cup of tea. I watched a taped Oprah show and learned what the "Red" campaign by Bono is all about. I had seen the ads on the buses and bus stops and in magazines but hadn't really heard much about it. Now I know that all the various companies are donating up to 50% of the profits from those items for AIDS medication to families in Africa. It was very touching and emotional, as only 40 cents a day will give the money for two pills to keep it from progressing. </p>
<p>Skyped with Doug and Beth today, heard from Virginia that Uncle Frank's surgeon is very pleased with his progress, and I answered a few emails, just not enough to make any dent in the huge stack that awaits me. </p>
