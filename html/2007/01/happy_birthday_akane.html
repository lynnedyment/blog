								<h2>Happy Birthday, Akane!</h2>
								<p>Today is Akane's 39th birthday. We have always been in Ontario for this celebration, while Akane has been in Japan for New Year's day... and her birthday. Dinner out at an authentic Chinese restaurant had been planned, so rather than eat from a fairly small choice of non-meat dishes, I had volunteered to babysit while Akane and Bryn ate out. I couldn't face the thought of someone at the next table ordering a dish served complete with chicken or duck head, even I were eating noodles! </p>
<p>Riku stopped in for a quick hello and a gingerbread cookie on his way to school this morning. He was wearing a Canadian/Maple Leaf hat, a matching jacket, and a Canadian Hockey pullover too! He was excited about seeing his best friend Nicolo at school today. </p>
<p>I had a quiet but busy morning at home, but called Akane to suggest that she and I have lunch out. She was up for it, and an hour later arrived with Mirei, all ready for her nap. I tucked her in... it took longer than usual, but it sure was entertaining. I lie beside her, but out of sight, on the double bed in Riku's room. Usually she chats a little bit, but since she is always ready for her nap, it doesn't take long until she is rubbing her eyes, pulling at her ears, and sighing big sighs. Today however, she was a busy little gal with so much chatting going on! And I could see her little index finger pointing to the print on the wall, and chatting to it, and then at the lighthouse, and the wall hanging which Auntie Sandy had given Kelly when she was a baby. A butterfly is painted on it, and it was such fun to watch her make our sign for butterflies, opening and closing her fists as they flutter above her head. I am sure it took her fifteen minutes to settle, but settle she did, and slept nicely for two solid hours for her Grandpa. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Akane and I were sitting having a very nice lunch at Cafe Gratitude, a choice both Akane and I were happy with. She has been there once before and this was my third visit; Akane had the enchilada special, and I had the "sun burger". All the food here is made "raw", all vegan and with bases of delicious nuts and seeds for the most part. Akane was very happy with her meal, but I didn't like mine nearly as much as the warm grain bowls I had on the previous two visits. The dressing on the "burger" with its strong tomato "ketchup" flavour did not sit well with the strong but very different dressing on the salad. However, we had shared an appetizer which was delicious, a combo of four different toppings on seeded unbaked "bread", and the "burger" was OK, just not something I would order again. Our server suggested I try it without the tomato topping the next time, but there are so many other good things on the menu that I will try first. </p>
<p>We left at 2:35 to pick Riku up from school. He was a very tired boy today, his first day back after a two week holiday. He came close to falling asleep in the car, but we managed to keep him awake until we reached our local playground a few minutes later. He suggested we call his dad so he could be the "monster", chasing him around, but instead I got this role, and chased after him, and his mom too... although really it was Riku I was growling after. How Riku loves this! He climbs fast up all the slides, and begs me not to catch him when he starts getting tired. However, the minute he catches his breath, off he goes again. Doug called just twenty minutes after we got there, but by then Riku was ready to come back here, and Akane and I were ready for tea. Oh, Riku told me that Nicolo has Power Rangers! Big news in his four-year-old life. </p>
<p>That Mirei! What a character she is! She was very happy to see her mommy, and nursed right away, but losing interest once the shortbread cookies were put on the table! That little finger was busy once again, pointing to make it clear that she wanted a cookie for herself. Even if you hide something from her, behind a cup for instance, she will lean way over and point, letting you know that you aren't fooling her one bit! Then it was playtime for her, following Riku around, flirting with her Grandpa, and exploring my basket of paper in the kitchen, until she came back to the table for some food. </p>
<p>How she eats! First came an entire jar of spring vegetables, then half of a very ripe pear, followed by some avocado bites, and a teething biscuit. Riku was hungry as well, and too tired to join Akane, Bryn, Brent, and his new girlfriend for dinner, so they went off while I fed Riku: two scrambled eggs, two pieces of "bacon", almost a full piece of toast, and a side dish of tomatoes. Doug dropped us off at Bryn's place, and for dessert Riku ate an entire orange on his own. Meanwhile, Mirei was once again eating there... another container of vegetables, a bowl of rice cereal, and half a jar of mixed fruit. </p>
<p>Bedtime routine followed almost immediately after dinner... Mirei was obviously tired, so while Riku played on his own in his room, I tried to settle her, but even though she showed signs of being very tired, she didn't settle, so up she got. I got Riku into his pajamas, he brushed his teeth, tried so hard to do some cleaning up after his sister messed up some toys in his room. This is his biggest complaint of all: Riku likes his room clean and isn't happy when things are spread about and out of place. He gives Mirei something to play with, but keeps a very close eye on her, as some things he just does not want her chewing on... his new Ultraman, for instance, or his three-headed monster! At one point, when he was anxious about what she was going to ruin, he said to me, "Nana, I am being serious with you. I don't want her to mess up my room." </p>
<p>I read "Green Eggs and Ham" to Riku, with Mirei sitting on my lap looking at the pictures. Riku really liked the book; it has been a while since I've read it to him, and it was long enough that by the end of it he was happy to lie down and settle in. I kissed him goodnight, and Mirei and I left the room at 7:15. I didn't hear a word from his room, but wished I had a monitor in there so I could hear if he chats to himself. </p>
<p>I was feeding Mirei more vegetables when Akane and Bryn walked in at 7:25. Oh, what a happy girl she was to see her mommy, and making it clear she wanted no one else, she settled right in to nurse. Bryn was trying to tuck her in when I left but by the time I got home, he had IM'd me saying she was "at the table, taking a bite of food, flirting, taking another bite, flirting... " My, my, she may put on a few pounds this month! </p>
<p>Doug picked me up after his T'ai Chi class, and home we came to watch a Helen Mirren DVD. I drifted off during some of it, but enjoyed most of the hour and a half first part of it... to be continued tomorrow perhaps. I tidied my very messy kitchen, folded a dryer full of clothes, and finished off the evening by going through half of the October photos on file in the computer. How Mirei has changed in these past two months. Her hemangioma has really lightened up, and is not such an angry and dark red anymore. She has slimmed out too, although it looks as though she's trying to fix that up! </p>
<p>Bed before midnight... oh, and cake and presents for Akane were put off until an evening with more free time for the children to join in. Akane is quite happy to have an extended birthday event! </p>
