								<h2>... And a Grand Saturday It Was, Begorra!</h2>
								<p>Happy St. Patrick's Day to you all. I called Riku this morning to see if he would like to go on an outing to Pier 39 after a cable car ride. He agreed, but first told me he had an idea... roughly in his words, he said "I think maybe Mommy should not pick me up at school anymore; I think you should pick me up and then we will go to Ocean Beach." I suggested that his mom would miss picking him up so perhaps we could instead have me pick him up on sunny days and go to Ocean Beach and his mom could pick him up on the other days. His thought seemed to be that even on days it was not sunny we could go to Ocean Beach. Yep, he enjoyed yesterday as much as I did, and I really must make an effort to get there with him at every opportunity. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped Riku off for me on his way to work, so that the two of us could have breakfast together before setting out. He had already eaten a banana, and we sat at the table with our bowls of porridge and blueberries. I had asked earlier if he would like an egg and toast breakfast, so to my surprise, after he ate the porridge and I suggested that we leave, he said "I thought I was going to have egg and toast and 'bacon'!" I am not sure where he put it all but all but a quarter of a piece of toast disappeared into that tummy! </p>
<p>As a result, we were later leaving than I hoped, so we decided to skip the cable car ride today, and head right to Pier 39 where we had arranged to meet Doug at 11:30. Riku is such an interesting companion, asking lots of questions along the route... "Why is that man using a cane?", "What does that sign say?", followed by "How does the wheelchair get on the bus?".. and then he actually got to see it happen, just as I had told him. He spotted Chinese signs, and a Japanese restaurant, we told each other which buildings we liked and which we didn't, and why. He doesn't like black buildings or black signs, and wrinkled up his nose as he told me they were "too dark". I agree. </p>
<p>One of the discussions we had was about food, after seeing billboards with lobster and crabs on them. He asked if I liked both of those and in each case I said no. "I like them; you should try them. It's a new taste!"... I could hear his dad coming through very clearly. We went on to talk about meat and chicken; when I told him I didn't like those either, and why (I don't like to kill animals to eat them) his reply was "Why you not like so many things?" and "I like to kill animals; I like to eat them. You should try them."</p>
<p>It's true that Riku has a wonderfully diverse appetite; both he and Mirei eat up almost everything they are given, and if not they are willing to try them. Riku doesn't like black beans, so I finally got to ask him why he didn't like something, but my guess is that one day he will like them and I never will try to eat pork or beef or seafood. I do eat the occasional piece of fish, though, so perhaps that will gain me some points! </p>
<p>Kevin made Bryn a wonderful goulash for his birthday last week, and both children, as well as the parents of course, polished off the stew, the noodles, the dumplings, and the pickled red cabbage too. The night before that they had all eaten chili relleno, highly seasoned pinto beans, salsa, tortillas, and more. It's great, although I do have to turn my head when I see Riku devouring raw fish. </p>
<p>We had a long walk to Pier 39 and Riku was very disappointed not to see the "bush man" I had told him about; this fellow hides behind branches and then jumps out and scares unsuspecting tourists. We will see him another day for sure though. Doug was already at Pier 39 looking at the sea lions, when we arrived, and from there we had Riku on the carousel with Doug. Riku next picked out a special spiny shell from the shell store, and we had lunch at Johnny Rocket's, a 50s style diner. Riku and Doug shared a milkshake, which was just adorable, and each had a grilled cheese sandwich. I enjoyed my veggie burger and fries, the latter a rare treat for me in this city.</p>
<p>The yodeling tape  was going full blast in the car, which managed to keep Riku awake, despite the long trip home: St. Patrick's Day crowds were everywhere. We dashed home with just enough time to check emails and head out again for our 3:05 double feature at the Balboa. The first movie was a lightweight but fun Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore pic called "Music and Lyrics", but the one we were there to see was "Breach", with Chris Cooper and Laura Linney ... wonderfully acted and a very interesting story based on the biggest U.S. spy case in history. </p>
<p>Ate lots of popcorn, so no dinner tonight. I called Jody as soon as I got home and then Gail and I worked on the family tree... of course!</p>
