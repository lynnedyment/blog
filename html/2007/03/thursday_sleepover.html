								<h2>Little Miss Home-Wrecker and a Thursday Sleepover</h2>
								<p>Mirei arrived on this gorgeous summer-like day wearing a soft beige top with slightly darker linen pants, such a sweet outfit on our little girl! I couldn't resist taking dozens of photos of her; she was being her usual animated happy self and made it easy for me to do so. </p>
<p>Riku attended a going-away party at a playground near his school today, from 1:30 on, so Mirei was here with us from the noon hour. How she makes her needs known these days! She has always been very good at pointing at things to indicate what she wants, but has now refined it to giving big smiles and nodding when I get it right. In she came today, pointing to the laundry room, and smiling when I asked her if she wanted something in there. Once in the room, I pointed to various things that might interest her; she had already figured that out and just had to be patient with me, until I found the right item. That smile let me know I was on the mark. </p>
<p>Mirei is walking a little bit more each day; crawling is still her main means of moving about, but Bryn wrote later tonight to say she had walked from their bathroom to the kitchen! She has taken thirteen steps here in a row, but I can see she is trying more to walk just in the past two days. I'm not in any rush at all; she will walk when she's ready and meanwhile we enjoy seeing her new crab walk, and the usual arm/foot motions. They will both disappear all too soon. </p>
<p>Bryn feels the same way about the happy babbling from her when he arrives home from work, knowing one day it will be a mere, "Hi Dad". </p>
<p>Doug was downtown working all afternoon, and continued on to his T'ai Chi class following that. But first he took Mirei on her regular "walkabout", something she never forgets to ask for. How does she do this? Well, she gets over to his computer chair, waits for him to notice her, and then starts pointing to one or two of the objects in the dining room on their tour. Her guide is rarely too busy to accommodate her, and knowing she would be off for her nap, and gone before he returned home, it happened earlier than usual today. </p>
<p>Mirei had a longer than usual nap than she has had lately, a full two hours minus perhaps five minutes. She had only napped a half hour at home this morning so was more than ready for it. </p>
<p>We had lots of time for playing upstairs, as of course it is one of the things that Mirei "asks" to do..  she heads for the stairs and then turns to see if it's okay, making rapid headway once I tell her yes. Doug and I have started calling her our little home-wrecker as she does leave a trail of destruction behind her these days. This afternoon she decided to play with all the travel items Doug leaves on a lower shelf; normally she leaves them alone, as she would much rather play with the phone or the tapes. However, today she ended up playing in the middle of a huge mess for the longest time, making sure that every shoe shine cloth came out of every little tiny box, and that everything got thoroughly pulled apart. Ah, bliss! </p>
<p>Akane and Riku didn't show up until after 5 P.M; I had his dinner almost ready for him, thinking I would make up for his too early rising at 5:30 today!  I was hoping for a 7 o'clock bedtime, but with all the distractions at dinner (his sister taking up some of his attention!), an unexpected bath with her, and (after his parents and sister left) stories and teeth brushing, it was 7:30 when I left the room with Riku sleeping. </p>
<p>Gail and I worked through papers on family tree, clearing up some mistakes from previous records done before we had access to the Internet connections. Before I knew it, bedtime for me had arrived too... midnight tonight. </p>
