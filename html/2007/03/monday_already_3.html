								<h2>Monday Already!</h2>
								<p>I do my laundry each Monday and the weeks go by so quickly that I feel as though I am doing it every four days! I guess that is a good sign; I'm obviously not bored at all. I would hate for time to drag on and on, but that isn't likely to happen in my case for a long long time. Gail and I often comment that we will have to live to at least one hundred to get all the things done that we have in mind, and if the ages of our ancestors are any indication, then we'll do it! </p>
<p>The morning and early afternoon flew by; the paper got read -- always a plus to have it read in the morning(!) -- the laundry got done, the bedding changed, the house tidied, and I whipped through some more emails as well. </p>
<p>The doorbell rang at 2 o'clock and there was Mirei, looking like Little Red Riding Hood in a new cardigan with a hood. We waved goodbye to her mom from the front door, so Mirei could practice ringing the bell herself. I could tell from the moment she entered the house today that this was a <strong>new</strong> Mirei. It's hard to explain, but it's as though she had entered a brand new stage; she was very verbal, very demonstrative, and walked more than she crawled for the first time ever! Even Doug noticed that she was doing things more aggressively; I think she has decided it's just time to get moving on the next stage and that stage is taking over today! What a delight! </p>
<p>How she loves sitting in the red chair at the little table, and drawing like Riku and Amelia. She pulled it out today, pointed to the seat, and when I asked if she would like to sit, her smile told me that was it exactly. Then that little finger pointed to the crayons, and then the pencil crayons. I am starting to get a nice collection of Mirei art to add to the Amelia and Riku stack. What fun all of this is! </p>
<p>Mirei stood for the longest time in the kitchen, playing with a toy phone, bending down to check something out, but getting right up again. Doug was paying attention to this, as it really was the longest time she had ever stood like that, and a few minutes later she walked all the way from the dry goods cupboard at one end of the kitchen area, to Doug sitting at his computer. It had to be twenty plus steps and we held our breath all the way for her! Even then she didn't sit down, but leaned against him until she was ready to move again. I will miss our little crawler, though, and so will enjoy what I think will be her last few days of this stage. </p>
<p>Even though she was tired, having had only a one hour nap ending at 12:30 at home, and with a tummy full of oatmeal, Mirei decided she just wasn't up to a sleep today at my house. So she puttered happily about, in her bare feet, which meant the walking went even better in the late afternoon, until it was time to leave to walk home at 5:30. Her dad commented on his sleepy girl when we walked in the house, and if we had lived five minutes further away, she would have been sound asleep. </p>
<p>I sat at the table while the children ate the meal Akane had left for them... pasta, steamed broccoli, some shrimp for Riku. They both ate lots but of course that was just a first course for Mirei! She ate beans and rice later on with us, as well as some fruit and tortilla before bed. </p>
<p>Riku showed me his birthday goodies bag from his birthday party and let his sister check some of them out too. He had a tiny notebook and he drew a picture for me, one for his mom and his dad, and then one for Mirei too. Tonight he drew a perfect little heart which he added to the hugs and kisses he now adds to his signature when he's done. Sweet, sweet! </p>
<p>Riku and I snuggled up for a long book before bed, and I think it took him perhaps two minutes before he was sound asleep. I walked out at 7:25, asking Bryn how Mirei had hurt herself. Riku and I thought maybe she had fallen as she was crying hard and long, but instead it was merely a battle of the wills between her and her dad. She was putting a toy in her mouth, despite being warned not to. The second time Bryn warned her, she totally ignored him as though to say "You and whose army is going to stop me?" so he decided to take it from her. She had such a hard grip on it that he really had to work hard to pry it out of her fist(!) ... and then having lost the battle she burst into really hard and loud tears! Yup, that's our girl... feisty, determined, and strong to boot! </p>
<p>Doug arrived with burritos for him and Bryn, and a frozen Chinese takeout from home for me... tofu and veggies. We all shared with Mirei, but first Bryn had to show me how much Mirei enjoys their Robert Bateman pictorial book. He asked her if she wanted to look at the animals. She gave that big smile of hers and quickly crawled over to the bookcase to show him the book. She is a funny girl and grunts to show that she can't do it on her own... does the same thing here with the big kitchen drawers she wants access to... and then happily clambered up to him to sit on his lap and see those animals. It was so cute, and I just had to show Grandpa too, getting exactly the same reaction from her the second time. </p>
<p>Mirei was obviously tired, her tummy was full, Bryn had already changed her into her night clothes, so as soon as dinner was over and the book was checked out again, it was tuck-in time for her too. Bryn was out of her room in less than three minutes, if that! </p>
<p>We spent the next hour just chatting, I did a little blogging, and before we knew it Bryn was leaving to pick up Akane at 9:15. We got home at 9:30 and Gail and I added five more children to the family we were researching last night. Gail managed to contact a distant relative through the World Family Tree who has all sorts of wonderful new information for us in the Parcels line, not all of it a direct link, but no doubt some of it will be very useful... yet another piece in the puzzle...</p>
