								<h2>Doug Home from England.. and Ten Teeth!</h2>
								<p>I lay in bed this morning for a few minutes, just luxuriating in the sense that I had had enough sleep, knowing I wouldn't drift back if I lay there any longer. The house was cold this morning... brrr! and while waiting for the heat to come up to above 60F, I wrote a few emails. Then I showered, put away the laundry, had breakfast, talked to Tay for about an hour, and quickly vacuumed through this floor, and cleaned both bathrooms. I also tidied up the laundry room after Mirei had dumped all the cleaning cloths and aprons/bibs on the floor yesterday. They had been picked up but not tidied. Then I treated myself to two full hours of family tree time with Gail, getting lots more filled in with information from Rick Parcels, a big source of documented dates and names. </p>
<p>Mirei arrived with her mom just before two o'clock, with a full tummy and needing a nap after a too short morning nap. Of course, despite the black beans, corn tortilla, and rice she had already eaten until she refused more at home, after a half hour of playing she still managed to tuck away a slightly smaller bowl of her usual "filler" dish here: oatmeal with banana and blueberries. The blueberries are frozen and in a smallish bag. Mirei seemed interested, so I handed them over to her, and she stood perfectly balanced, while inspecting the bag with both hands. Every day her confidence grows! It's such a subtle thing and yet is still noticeable. She just stands longer, or more steadily, looking very sure of herself. And she lets herself down so nicely too when she decides to. </p>
<p>Yesterday she played with some new magnetic building pieces, which she really enjoys pulling apart and stacking. Today I gave her a stacking set of "doughnuts" that go on a stand; Gail and Tom bought these for Riku when he was one, and Mirei is the perfect age for them. She was quite amused at my stacking them on my head, clapping for me... what a great audience she is! I put two of them on her wrists, which she found very intriguing as she couldn't get them off by herself but had the idea of how they should come off. It was fun to see her trying to do it herself, but she really did need an extra tug to get them over her hands. </p>
<p>Mirei has had no trouble at all cutting her teeth and the only way we know that she has new ones is to go poking around in her mouth, something she is perfectly fine with. Sometimes I pretend she has bitten me, and yelp, and how she laughs! She had a new one in last week too, another bicuspid, just days after the one above had come in, but today that fourth one finally broke though the gum line. That smile is just going to get bigger and bigger! </p>
<p>She napped for an hour and twenty minutes. I made myself a spinach, goat cheese, and onion omelet, heated up a cup of tea that had gone cold, and sat upstairs on my bed for fifteen minutes reading. Akane and Riku were sitting in the kitchen when I came down, having come in a little earlier than I expected them to be here, and quietly too, as Mirei was still sleeping. I was very surprised that Riku didn't come up to find me! However, he told me he wanted to come and see me "because I didn't see you for a long time and I miss you." </p>
<p>I made a pot of tea, and toasted cinnamon raisin bagels spread with the lemon quark we bought at the Ferry Market two weeks ago. It is <strong>so</strong> good, and tasted like dessert. Akane really liked it and Mirei enjoyed a bagel too, sans the quark. Riku and I tossed a soft monkey back and forth to each other in the kitchen; he has become a very good catcher, and we really must do this more often. Then he found a car he hadn't played with for a long time and kept himself busy with that until it was time to leave. </p>
<p>At 4:40, we all left the house together, Akane and Mirei home, and Riku and I to the airport. Riku happily looked out the windows all the way there, delighted when he spotted a train above the highway, and listening to the yodelling tape we have been playing since Doug left. Kelly's Bryn had loved it at this age, or possibly younger, and I had forgotten all about it. Doug managed to find it before he left on his trip, and we've been playing it every single time Riku and I have been in the car together. It helps to keep him awake after his long day at school! </p>
<p>Doug was sitting waiting for us when we arrived; it took longer to get out of the house than I planned on, and then took me longer to find my way around the unfamiliar to me international terminal. Despite "racing" Riku through the long corridors to the arrivals area, Doug had already been there for a half hour, but was delighted to see Riku, and Riku to see him. They had big hugs, we had a family hug, and Riku thoroughly enjoyed his ride on the baggage cart. </p>
<p>We took Riku upstairs at home so that Mirei could see her Grandpa too. She was busy pulling apart a lower cupboard when we arrived; Doug said her name, she stopped in her tracks, stared at him and then came barreling towards him with a big grin on her face, a happy girl indeed. She touched his nose, and inspected his face carefully, grinning away at him, while Riku and I tossed a big lightweight ball around. We didn't stay long as it was midnight body time for Doug, after a very long day, and he was feeling the hours. Bryn came in just moments after we arrived so he got to welcome his dad home too. </p>
<p>Doug had close to 1,000 email messages, so got to work on some of those while Gail and I spent two hours on the family tree, with more entries from Rick to add to, and to check as well. Glenn called through on Skype; it has been a long time since he has called, so we had a three way conference call and caught up on all his news. The best was that he and Wendy will be around for the whole weekend of the reunion; he had mixed up his dates and doesn't have to go to up north until the following weekend, the long weekend in May. </p>
<p>Doug kept coming over with gifts for me... three boxes of my favourite Harrod's # 16 tea, a small box of  clotted cream fudge, two coconut milk chocolate bars,  a dark chocolate Kit Kat bar, new to me, and my favourite British Cadbury bar... a fruit and nut bar, which is richer than the Cadbury's bars available here and in Canada. It's soooo good and I can't believe he brought back such a small one! We used to buy huge bars of it when we lived in England. There is also a sampler pack of Kendal Mint Cake which he bought in Kendal, not too far from Ambleside in the Lake District, the very same town where Kelly and I first discovered it. It was used by Sir Edmund Hilary when he climbed Everest but it's really just pure flavoured sugar in solid form... good though! </p>
<p>It's only 10:30 but I am heading off to bed. It seemed a busy day, possibly because I did some housework!</p>
