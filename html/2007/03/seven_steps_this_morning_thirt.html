								<h2>Seven Steps This Morning, Thirteen This Afternoon: We Have a Walker!</h2>
								<p>What an exciting day this was; Mirei decided today was <strong>the</strong> day to be an official walker! She was excited about it too, I guess, as she just could not settle down for her nap, and she tried twice. I'm sure she must have been lying there thinking that if she could only get up she would be sure to walk, and so she did. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn dropped her off just before 1:30 today while I was finishing vacuuming upstairs. It didn't matter a bit as Grandpa was here to tend to her for a few minutes. She looked just darling in pink and white striped cotton pants, and a bright pink top, matching her rosy cheeks today. They were even rosier after she polished off her oatmeal; I found out later she had had it for breakfast too(!), but with raisins in place of the mashed banana and blueberries she usually has here. Maybe all that cereal gave her lots of energy, as she was showing off her standing skills a lot today. Doug was quite astounded at how well and how long she stood today, as though she had been at it for ages. I must say she has been practicing a lot lately. </p>
<p>Susan called and we had a little time to catch up on news. They are in the process of closing on a house(!) ... should know by next week perhaps. Finn has a cold, poor wee guy, and is coughing and threw up twice, Amelia is fine, and Susan needs a massage. I hope this is going to happen next week and I shall finally get to take care of this baby for a morning! I can't wait to have some snuggling time with him, but Susan wasn't prepared to try him on pumped milk quite yet. Next week it might happen. </p>
<p>Mirei and I played ball on the kitchen floor today and had the most fun. I would roll the ball to her and she either bounced it back to me, rolled it to me, or did her funny little scootch on one knee and dragging her other leg behind her, to present it to me. How she loved this game! We demonstrated it to Bryn before he took her home, and it was more fun with three of us. This is when she walked to me and how we clapped for her when she arrived, after starting off with her daddy. I do hope I captured a few steps on camera, although it won't be of the big main walk!  Off they went for dinner at home and to show off to her mommy and brother, I'm sure. </p>
<p>I made a big hot mug of tea, took it upstairs and watched a taped Oprah; usually I have some quiet time while Mirei naps but that didn't happen today. Gail wasn't on Skype for any "tree" time either so stretching out seemed like a good second choice. </p>
<p>Doug and I had pizza and salad upstairs while we watched "Grey's Anatomy"; it's a show we both enjoy a lot, but tonight was just a bit over the top from the usual show. We hope it doesn't continue in this vein. Then we watched another Oprah I had seen last week, and want Bryn to see as well. It's about talented young people, and Doug enjoyed it as much as I had, especially the young man from India who performed his first surgery on fused fingers when he was seven years old! </p>
<p>I had some information in from Rick Parcels on Gerry's family tree line, so got to work on that while Doug caught up on two other shows he enjoys. This line was a bit of a puzzle with two wives and a child listed as a son of a mother who was too old to have birthed him. Hmmm. </p>
<p>Bed time... 11:30. Night night.</p>
