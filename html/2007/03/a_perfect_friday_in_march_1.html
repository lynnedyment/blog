								<h2>You May Kiss My Hand, and a Perfect Ocean Beach Afternoon</h2>
								<p>... except that I didn't see Finn as planned; I had suggested a few days ago to Susan that I would love a walk in the park with Finn this morning. However, Akane had a doctor's appointment she had forgotten to tell me about, and so instead Iwent over to pick up Mirei at 10 A.M.  So, back we came to the house, with just enough playtime for Mirei before her big bowl of porridge was ready for her pre-nap snack. She slept for almost two full hours, so I was delighted that I had taken her after all! Neither Akane nor I were sure Mirei would have napped through the appointment.</p>
<p>Mirei had both Doug and me laughing so hard today, as she seemed to make good use of her middle name, Elizabeth, and kept holding her hand, palm down, to Doug's lips so that he could kiss it! Very queenly indeed! It was adorable and she did the same for me too, just not as frequently. When she left with Akane around 2 P.M., Mirei put her hand on one of my cheeks and kissed the other, ever so sweetly. What a dear affectionate little girl she is. Her "babies" get hugged and kissed every time she picks them up.  </p>
<p>Akane came by to pick her up, bringing along delicious veggie spring rolls as a treat; I had eaten lunch, so we each had one and I saved the container of my favourite broccoli and tofu from the Noe Valley Chinese take-away for another time. </p>
<p>As it was such a gorgeous day, I decided that picking Riku up from school for an hour or two at Ocean Beach would be the perfect end to his week at school, and mine at home! Susan said they would try to get there too, and we arranged a spot to meet up. Riku was just delighted to see me; we hadn't planned this at all, and then to hear that we were on our way to Ocean Beach, and Amelia would be there too, just brought bigger and bigger smiles to his face. He came to the door of the school with a paper St. Pat's necklace on, and I wish I had taken a photo of it. </p>
<p>The beach is a mere eight minutes tops from his school, and we sang all the way there. Interesting that Riku more often sings in Japanese now if he is singing on his own, unless he has an English song in his head already, like "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" which pops out now and then. We parked right in front of the steps, across from the Beach House restaurant, sure that we would be easy to spot, despite the huge numbers of people on the beach this hot and sunny afternoon. </p>
<p>We spent two and a half hours there and what fun we had! Riku was quite content to play with his trucks, waiting for Amelia to show up, but after a while we went down to the water's edge to put our feet in, and collect water in two pails. Riku spent lots of time exploring the little rivulets formed by the low tide, and found some interesting shells and stones. The sand there was wet enough to allow us to dig a <strong>very</strong> deep hole, and of course a tall mountain right beside it. I took so many photos of him; I know how much he loves the beach and he knows how much I like it too. It really was the perfect day. </p>
<p>One of the interesting things about Riku is that he is so very willing to make new friends. He is just not shy when it comes to introducing himself and seems very assured that he will happily accepted. The last time we were at the beach he found some new friends, a small group of two men and two women, who invited him to play frisbee with him. This happened today as well; a young couple were playing tossing one about, Riku wandered over and told them his name, and they asked if he would like to play with them. I did call him back after a few minutes, but how he enjoyed joining in. It's adorable. </p>
<p>Later we learned that Susan was expecting a delivery at exactly the time that she hoped they could join us, but with no cell phone, I had no idea why they hadn't showed up. Next time we will pick Amelia up in a situation like this. We were both reluctant to leave, although I knew the chances of Riku falling asleep on the way home were greater with every extra minute we spent there. One day we will stay long enough to watch the sun set, though. </p>
<p>With the yodeling tape playing, and apple slices to munch on, I managed to keep Riku awake... all the way home but for five minutes! Poor wee guy; I picked him up and talked to him and then his daddy came down to carry him upstairs. He waved from the hallway window and then from their living room window, though, and I'm sure he was playing happily with Mirei within minutes. Bryn did write later to tell me he was all ready for bed at 7 o'clock with just stories ahead for him, so this worked out well after all. Whew! </p>
<p>I dropped Riku at 5:45, Gail and I got right to work on our family tree, and at 8:15 we stopped so that Doug and I could watch a rented movie... "Babel", which was excellent. Doug and I both did a little emailing before heading off to bed at midnight.</p>
