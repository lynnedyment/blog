								<h2>Lots of Kisses... and Two Movies</h2>
								<p>Mirei arrived here for a nap yesterday morning; I had already eaten, read the paper, and even managed to get some birthday cards ready for the mail before Bryn showed up with a tired-looking but happy little girl.</p>
<p>Bryn stayed for a little while, and asked if I how I would feel about taking care of Mirei for two weeks, during the days, from morning until he gets home from work, while Akane and Riku go to Japan... next week! I agreed, and welcome the opportunity to spend more time with Mirei, and with luck get together with Susan and Finn for walks and adventures. I will miss Riku though; I was looking forward to the free days with him during spring break, and he will miss Easter as well. We will just have to decorate eggs and hide goodies when they return.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mirei was going through my cupboards, and did until Bryn left to pick up Akane and Riku for their Saturday trip to Japantown. Soon after it was time for Mirei to eat her second breakfast. It's always best to have this little girl's tummy full before putting her down for a nap. We think that if there is even a little corner empty, then a nap just isn't going to happen! And there always seems to be room for her porridge with banana and berries.</p>
<p>She was asleep within minutes so I tidied up some paper work and did some family tree work with Gail. Mirei napped for just over an hour and a half, ate a big plate of avocado, kabocha squash, a scrambled egg, and some dark greens left over from a selection of Japanese food that Susan had given to me after walking Finn. She fed herself those and the egg, wolfing both down, as though she hadn't been fed for hours. I don't know where she puts it all, but this is a girl who likes her food. </p>
<p>Mirei continues to walk a few steps, sometimes a dozen, before easing herself to the floor for some serious crawling. It occurred to me the other day that she is quite unusual in this way. Usually, once a little one discovers walking, she/he's a walker, but not Mirei; she is happy to be more flexible about her means of transportation.</p>
<p>I keep a little "pusher" called a Miffi Walker in the front bedroom; there are bags of baby clothes on the floor waiting to be sorted, so the door is kept shut most of the time while Mirei is here. However, she knows her walker is in there, and always points to the door to let me know she wants it. Each time she is on her way to bed, she looks down the hallway to point at that room; I always tell her she can use if after her nap and without fail she remembers that. Mirei is happy to push it down the hallway and once in a while into the kitchen, but usually that one short trip with it is enough to satisfy her.</p>
<p>This morning she took a doll our of the big toy basket in the kitchen and sat kissing it. From there she kissed her image in the reflection on the oven door, and then put her little face up to me to kiss as well. While I was feeding her I was also given three or four sloppy kisses and she was pursing her lips towards Doug, who was sitting in the dining room, too far away. Bryn mentioned yesterday that she gives Riku and her mommy lots of kisses but pulls back from his bristly face and beard, as she does with Doug as well. You can see her preparing to pull back; this girl likes her men beardless!</p>
<p>We all met Bryn and family outside the "Four Star" theatre just minutes before our two movies were about to start, at 2:10. They went off to see the new Doering/Ellis home, while we saw two very good movies for the price of one... "The Painted Veil" and "Volver", both very well acted with some gorgeous scenery of China in the first one.</p>
<p>Home close to 8 P.M. after a quick stop for yogurt and bananas, and then two hours with Gail, working on ... our family tree, of course!</p>
<p>Bed at midnight...</p>
