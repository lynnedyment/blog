								<h2>Riku, Amelia, and Finn Day!</h2>
								<p>Woke up to Riku lying beside me, slowly coming to at 7:10 A.M., almost a full twelve hours sleep for him. In a groggy voice he told me about his dream, something he always does here when he first awakens. Today it was about being afraid of something shaking and climbing up and up, but he was soon up and running to "beat" me to the bathroom, giggling all the way. He won. </p>
<p>He got dressed immediately, wearing a new "monster truck" long sleeved t-shirt. He was quite intrigued by the sticky label on it that said it was a "size three" and told me he would take it to school. He did, and had it with him when he came out too! </p>
<p>Our morning tradition here is for Riku to watch "Caillou" while I shower, and he eats his fruit while he does so. Then we came downstairs for breakfast, he ate his oatmeal, and had some time to play with Playdoh too. It was a lovely unrushed morning for us both. He even asked Grandpa to trim a hangnail for him, remembering on his own to ask when Doug got up. </p>
<p>At 8:25 we left to pick up Kai, his schoolmate who lives just two blocks from Riku. He also had a shirt on with a big car on it; they looked very cute sitting in the back seat sharing the apple slices I had prepared for Riku. Kai said he liked the yodelling music that Riku listens to every time we are in the car now, but we also saw active cranes, men preparing to roof a building, two trucks with ladders on the backs, and we sang some songs too once the yodelling was through.</p>
<p>We had stopped by to pick up Riku's lunch at his house, and so I got to see smiling Mirei, all dressed in pink today. </p>
<p>It was such a gorgeous morning, sunny and warm, and it seemed a shame to be taking Riku to school. He had said this morning, as he often does at home too, that he didn't want to go to school, but wanted to go to the Bay Area Discovery Museum or Ocean Beach, which I had mentioned the night before. Like Amelia, who also says she wants to go to the zoo or the museum instead of school, they like school once they get there but no doubt miss those days when they were just free to wander about the fun places in the city more frequently.  </p>
<p>When I said goodbye to Riku he said, "Come and get me, OK?" but at the time I had no thought of doing so, assuming that of course I would be home with Mirei. Uneventful morning and early afternoon, filled with the usual busy housework/emails/meals. I was at the front window at 1:55 expecting to see Akane dashing here with Mirei in the stroller, but they were nowhere in sight. At 2:10 Akane called to say she had lost track of time and would have to take a taxi to get Riku. Of course I volunteered to pick him up, and left not too much later so that I could stop by the playground across from Susan's and tell Amelia that we would stop by to play with her. Her preschool ends every Thursday there, which is very handy for Susan, and for us too as we drive right by on the way home. </p>
<p>Riku was just delighted to see me there; his little face lit up and he came cheerfully bounding up the stairs with a big hug and kiss for me. Amelia was ready to go home by the time we reached the park; she has a long busy day at preschool with lots of running around and fresh air time. Riku told me he had played outside for a "little bit" today as well, so in we all went for popcorn, juice, and quiet time together watching "Peter Pan", a new DVD Amelia had only seen once. How Riku loved it; the two of them sat so nicely together watching it, while I had lots of time to hold Finn. </p>
<p>He had been to a gastroenterologist today about his discomfort during and after nursing, and it was confirmed that he has acid reflux problems, and possibly a slightly floppy esophagus. He does much better when he is being held, as I think it's easier to help him relieve any gas build-up if he can be moved around to help his tummy. What a little doll he is; he is actually 13-1/2 pounds already but seems so tiny compared to Mirei I suppose. I calmed him standing in the kitchen chatting with Susan, and then held him while sitting in the living room in the sunshine. He was picture perfect and Susan took some photos for me with my camera. </p>
<p>Riku and I had to go dashing off at 5:15, just as the movie ended, to have the car home for Doug at 5:40 for his T'ai Chi lesson and we just made it. Bryn came down to collect Riku, having been to the dermatologist and the dentist today. Busy day for everyone. </p>
<p>Spent until 10 P.M. with Gail on Skype deleting more folks from our family tree who are too far off the main branches, mostly the parents of people who are not related to us. We can always add them back in, but truly just sticking with our main branches will be enough work for this lifetime! </p>
<p>Emails... and bed before 11... tired tonight.</p>
