								<h2><a href="/2007/03/doug_home_from_england.html">Doug Home from England.. and Ten Teeth!</a></h2>
								<p>I lay in bed this morning for a few minutes, just luxuriating in the sense that I had had enough sleep, knowing I wouldn't drift back if I lay there any longer. The house was cold this morning... brrr! and while waiting for the heat to come up to above 60F, I wrote a few emails. Then I showered, put away the laundry, had breakfast, talked to Tay for about an hour, and quickly vacuumed through this floor, and cleaned both bathrooms. I also tidied up the laundry room after Mirei had dumped all the cleaning cloths and aprons/bibs on the floor yesterday. They had been picked up but not tidied. Then I treated myself to two full hours of family tree time with Gail, getting lots more filled in with information from Rick Parcels, a big source of documented dates and names. </p>
<p>Mirei arrived with her mom just before two o'clock, with a full tummy and needing a nap after a too short morning nap. Of course, despite the black beans, corn tortilla, and rice she had already eaten until she refused more at home, after a half hour of playing she still managed to tuck away a slightly smaller bowl of her usual "filler" dish here: oatmeal with banana and blueberries. The blueberries are frozen and in a smallish bag. Mirei seemed interested, so I handed them over to her, and she stood perfectly balanced, while inspecting the bag with both hands. Every day her confidence grows! It's such a subtle thing and yet is still noticeable. She just stands longer, or more steadily, looking very sure of herself. And she lets herself down so nicely too when she decides to. </p>
<p>Yesterday she played with some new magnetic building pieces, which she really enjoys pulling apart and stacking. Today I gave her a stacking set of "doughnuts" that go on a stand; Gail and Tom bought these for Riku when he was one, and Mirei is the perfect age for them. She was quite amused at my stacking them on my head, clapping for me... what a great audience she is! I put two of them on her wrists, which she found very intriguing as she couldn't get them off by herself but had the idea of how they should come off. It was fun to see her trying to do it herself, but she really did need an extra tug to get them over her hands. </p>
<p>Mirei has had no trouble at all cutting her teeth and the only way we know that she has new ones is to go poking around in her mouth, something she is perfectly fine with. Sometimes I pretend she has bitten me, and yelp, and how she laughs! She had a new one in last week too, another bicuspid, just days after the one above had come in, but today that fourth one finally broke though the gum line. That smile is just going to get bigger and bigger! </p>
<p>She napped for an hour and twenty minutes. I made myself a spinach, goat cheese, and onion omelet, heated up a cup of tea that had gone cold, and sat upstairs on my bed for fifteen minutes reading. Akane and Riku were sitting in the kitchen when I came down, having come in a little earlier than I expected them to be here, and quietly too, as Mirei was still sleeping. I was very surprised that Riku didn't come up to find me! However, he told me he wanted to come and see me "because I didn't see you for a long time and I miss you." </p>
<p>I made a pot of tea, and toasted cinnamon raisin bagels spread with the lemon quark we bought at the Ferry Market two weeks ago. It is <strong>so</strong> good, and tasted like dessert. Akane really liked it and Mirei enjoyed a bagel too, sans the quark. Riku and I tossed a soft monkey back and forth to each other in the kitchen; he has become a very good catcher, and we really must do this more often. Then he found a car he hadn't played with for a long time and kept himself busy with that until it was time to leave. </p>
<p>At 4:40, we all left the house together, Akane and Mirei home, and Riku and I to the airport. Riku happily looked out the windows all the way there, delighted when he spotted a train above the highway, and listening to the yodelling tape we have been playing since Doug left. Kelly's Bryn had loved it at this age, or possibly younger, and I had forgotten all about it. Doug managed to find it before he left on his trip, and we've been playing it every single time Riku and I have been in the car together. It helps to keep him awake after his long day at school! </p>
<p>Doug was sitting waiting for us when we arrived; it took longer to get out of the house than I planned on, and then took me longer to find my way around the unfamiliar to me international terminal. Despite "racing" Riku through the long corridors to the arrivals area, Doug had already been there for a half hour, but was delighted to see Riku, and Riku to see him. They had big hugs, we had a family hug, and Riku thoroughly enjoyed his ride on the baggage cart. </p>
<p>We took Riku upstairs at home so that Mirei could see her Grandpa too. She was busy pulling apart a lower cupboard when we arrived; Doug said her name, she stopped in her tracks, stared at him and then came barreling towards him with a big grin on her face, a happy girl indeed. She touched his nose, and inspected his face carefully, grinning away at him, while Riku and I tossed a big lightweight ball around. We didn't stay long as it was midnight body time for Doug, after a very long day, and he was feeling the hours. Bryn came in just moments after we arrived so he got to welcome his dad home too. </p>
<p>Doug had close to 1,000 email messages, so got to work on some of those while Gail and I spent two hours on the family tree, with more entries from Rick to add to, and to check as well. Glenn called through on Skype; it has been a long time since he has called, so we had a three way conference call and caught up on all his news. The best was that he and Wendy will be around for the whole weekend of the reunion; he had mixed up his dates and doesn't have to go to up north until the following weekend, the long weekend in May. </p>
<p>Doug kept coming over with gifts for me... three boxes of my favourite Harrod's # 16 tea, a small box of  clotted cream fudge, two coconut milk chocolate bars,  a dark chocolate Kit Kat bar, new to me, and my favourite British Cadbury bar... a fruit and nut bar, which is richer than the Cadbury's bars available here and in Canada. It's soooo good and I can't believe he brought back such a small one! We used to buy huge bars of it when we lived in England. There is also a sampler pack of Kendal Mint Cake which he bought in Kendal, not too far from Ambleside in the Lake District, the very same town where Kelly and I first discovered it. It was used by Sir Edmund Hilary when he climbed Everest but it's really just pure flavoured sugar in solid form... good though! </p>
<p>It's only 10:30 but I am heading off to bed. It seemed a busy day, possibly because I did some housework!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/03/seven_steps_this_morning_thirt.html">Seven Steps This Morning, Thirteen This Afternoon: We Have a Walker!</a></h2>
								<p>What an exciting day this was; Mirei decided today was <strong>the</strong> day to be an official walker! She was excited about it too, I guess, as she just could not settle down for her nap, and she tried twice. I'm sure she must have been lying there thinking that if she could only get up she would be sure to walk, and so she did. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn dropped her off just before 1:30 today while I was finishing vacuuming upstairs. It didn't matter a bit as Grandpa was here to tend to her for a few minutes. She looked just darling in pink and white striped cotton pants, and a bright pink top, matching her rosy cheeks today. They were even rosier after she polished off her oatmeal; I found out later she had had it for breakfast too(!), but with raisins in place of the mashed banana and blueberries she usually has here. Maybe all that cereal gave her lots of energy, as she was showing off her standing skills a lot today. Doug was quite astounded at how well and how long she stood today, as though she had been at it for ages. I must say she has been practicing a lot lately. </p>
<p>Susan called and we had a little time to catch up on news. They are in the process of closing on a house(!) ... should know by next week perhaps. Finn has a cold, poor wee guy, and is coughing and threw up twice, Amelia is fine, and Susan needs a massage. I hope this is going to happen next week and I shall finally get to take care of this baby for a morning! I can't wait to have some snuggling time with him, but Susan wasn't prepared to try him on pumped milk quite yet. Next week it might happen. </p>
<p>Mirei and I played ball on the kitchen floor today and had the most fun. I would roll the ball to her and she either bounced it back to me, rolled it to me, or did her funny little scootch on one knee and dragging her other leg behind her, to present it to me. How she loved this game! We demonstrated it to Bryn before he took her home, and it was more fun with three of us. This is when she walked to me and how we clapped for her when she arrived, after starting off with her daddy. I do hope I captured a few steps on camera, although it won't be of the big main walk!  Off they went for dinner at home and to show off to her mommy and brother, I'm sure. </p>
<p>I made a big hot mug of tea, took it upstairs and watched a taped Oprah; usually I have some quiet time while Mirei naps but that didn't happen today. Gail wasn't on Skype for any "tree" time either so stretching out seemed like a good second choice. </p>
<p>Doug and I had pizza and salad upstairs while we watched "Grey's Anatomy"; it's a show we both enjoy a lot, but tonight was just a bit over the top from the usual show. We hope it doesn't continue in this vein. Then we watched another Oprah I had seen last week, and want Bryn to see as well. It's about talented young people, and Doug enjoyed it as much as I had, especially the young man from India who performed his first surgery on fused fingers when he was seven years old! </p>
<p>I had some information in from Rick Parcels on Gerry's family tree line, so got to work on that while Doug caught up on two other shows he enjoys. This line was a bit of a puzzle with two wives and a child listed as a son of a mother who was too old to have birthed him. Hmmm. </p>
<p>Bed time... 11:30. Night night.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/03/starry_starry_night_and_dragon.html">Starry, Starry Night... and Dragons Too!</a></h2>
								<p>It was a gorgeous spring-like day today, with warm temps and clear blue skies. I hate to admit that we spent the entire day inside, but we did. Somehow the hours just flew by, and the day was gone! </p>
<p>Akane, Bryn, and Riku went off to a multi-family yard sale, looking for Japanese books for Riku, so Miss Mirei was here for play time and nap time with me for a few hours. Doug went off to his first T'ai Chi class in two plus weeks, so he was gone when she arrived. Of course she had seen him on Thursday night briefly and on Friday afternoon, so she was quite perplexed that he wasn't sitting in his chair in front of the computer when she came in. She even peered into the kitchen, hoping that he would be at the table, but no such luck, and up went her hands and eyebrows... they say it all... "Where in the world can he be now? "</p>
<p>And after a big breakfast she was already down for her nap when he came in, so it was after her two hour sleep that she finally got to see him. I fed her a bit of lunch, and just in time as her dad came by shortly after she had eaten. Riku and Akane were napping in the car, though, so he had time to join us upstairs. I had a show on amazing children taped that I wanted him to see and he got more than halfway through it before Akane called. I kept Mirei entertained with the big Lego blocks she is just learning to pull apart. She struggles first, grunting and groaning with effort, before finally passing it over for a little help from Nana. </p>
<p>I forgot to mention yesterday that when we were upstairs playing in our room the evening before, she had leaned over to kiss a picture on the cover of a book of a family, many many times. It was adorable. She also kissed "the baby" in the fireplace mirror and likes to put her mouth against my cheek for a big smackaroo too! It's adorable. </p>
<p>Mirei has gotten used to waving goodbye from the window,  every time someone leaves the house,as it's something we do from our house and theirs as well. We were always lucky enough to live in a spot that allowed us to do this from the time Kelly was a baby and the tradition has continued. </p>
<p>As busy as Riku is at something he will go dashing to the window, encouraging everyone else to "come, quick, they're leaving!" so they don't miss out. Bryn is so good with Mirei, and instead of just popping her into her car seat, will often show her something first... the dog two doors over that Mirei hopes to see in the window, a plane, some birds, a local cat... whatever he thinks she might be interested in... and if it takes too long Riku will say "Go! Go!", but as anxious as he is to get back to his game, cars, drawing, he will not budge until we have waved until the car is out of sight. I love to think this is something the children will remember all of their days. </p>
<p>Gail and I had some time with our family tree after Mirei and Bryn left, and caught up on some new facts and dates. That time always flies by as well, and before we knew it it was time to break for dinner. The doorbell rang and it was Mirei with her mom! I had totally forgotten that we were having Mirei here tonight while her brother and parents went to the Chinese New Year's parade in Chinatown. It was 5:30, and Mirei was hungry too, so I quickly made a stir fry with rice for us, and Mirei had rice with a mixed vegetable dinner from a jar and a nice bowl of strained pears for dessert. She will not eat fresh pairs and rarely will eat a piece of banana, but mash the bananas or give her strained pears and she is perfectly happy to indulge. I think it's a texture thing... </p>
<p>After dinner was "splashy bath" time... one of Mirei's favourite pastimes. She was sitting at the table, just getting washed up, when I asked if she would like one, and she immediately gets into her "let's get at it!" mode. Straining in her seat to get up and out, and then beetling off to the bathroom at top speed. By the time I was in, she had one of her little legs hoisted up over the side of the tub, really trying hard to get in, clothes and all. Of course her legs are much too short to actually get in, but that doesn't stop her from trying really hard anyway! </p>
<p>I took lots of photos of her, and gave her hair a little curl at the top when it was wet. How she loves to splash about, chasing the tub toys about, and trying hard to release the plunger to let the water out. Doug came in long enough to see her thoroughly enjoying the bubbles I was blowing at her. She goes right at them, to break them and to inspect them when they land on her arms. No matter how long I have her in the water, she cries a little when I take her out. However, she also loves having her body lotion rubbed on her, and giggles when I do her feet and toes. When I brought her out in an old pair of Riku's pale green one-piece sleepers, Doug commented on how cute she looked... and she sure did. </p>
<p>She and I sat on the sofa reading books, turning the pages over and over on her favourite ones, which include "Pat the Bunny" and a peek-a-boo book with small children and their body parts... hands, feet, heads, etc. ... which she loves to lift-the-flap to see for herself. </p>
<p>I wanted to "top her up" before her bedtime, so we sat at the table with more books, one with a feather to blow, while she ate tiny bites of a whole wheat cinnamon raisin bagel. I gave her a toasted and buttered quarter, ate the other half of it, and then had to go and toast another since she was more than ready for that too. </p>
<p>Mirei was a tired girl, I thought Bryn would be here soon for her, so into her sleeper blanket she went, and since it was such a mild night, we went outside to sit on the front steps to wait for him. What a lovely time we had. Buses were going by, and Mirei was just delighted when I sang the "Wheels on the Bus" song to her each time we saw one. How she loved my going "beep beep beep" and "swish swish swish" using her own hand for the gestures! We saw the flashing red lights from Sutro Tower, heard two planes and saw their brief tail lights, and heard a dog barking. There was lots to see and talk about, but the best part of the whole evening was seeing how quickly Mirei learned a new word and could "tell" it to me using a sign. She spotted a big bright star and pointed it out to me. I said the word and instantly made up a sign for it, by opening and closing my hand quickly and saying "star". Another bus went by, she spotted a cat walking across the road, and then pointed to the star, opening and closing her hand to let me know she knew it! This has happened twice this week and it just astounds me; she in not only eager to learn a new word but quick to pick up on it too. What a girl! </p>
<p>Riku enjoyed the Chinese parade, complete with loud drumming and lots of very large dragons; it was as crowded as it always is for that celebration, but he was happily perched on his Dad's shoulders just five people back from the curb, so had a good view after all. They finished off their day with Chinese food and then home for tuck-in time. Tonight is Riku's second night sleeping through on his own; he awoke three times last night, crying out, but soon settled and went back to sleep without a parent. </p>
<p>Mirei's little head was bobbing in tiredness a bit as we waited; she hadn't had an afternoon nap, only the late morning one, and once it a while she would stand up and nestle against my shoulder. Bryn said she was asleep the instant the car moved and was sound asleep by the time they reached home three minutes later... tucked into her crib within five minutes of leaving here. What a busy day for this busy little one. </p>
<p>Gail and I had some family tree time, and then both went off to bed to read. Lights out here at 11:25.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/03/slowwwww_sunday.html">Slowwwww Sunday</a></h2>
								<p>Today was very quiet around here with nary a child in sight. It passed by very slowly as a result; funny how that happens! Doug and I had poached eggs on toast for breakfast, a rare treat, since Doug usually eats much earlier than I do and has a yogurt, some toast, and juice. However, he woke up at 5 A.M. today(!), sat at the computer and was ready to eat when I came down at 8 o'clock. </p>
<p>I had a quiet morning with the Sunday paper, wrote a few emails, had a long leisurely shower, and by 10:30 was ready for some kiddie time; I didn't have long before we had to leave for our afternoon movies, so I suggested a trike ride for Riku around the block, but was turned down. He told me he was watching "Totoro", and was obviously engrossed in it, as he filled me in on the action and told me he wanted to see it, not go for a ride. Boo hoo. Mirei was in her crib, having "quiet time" her mom told me, with the idea that she might drift off to sleep. </p>
<p>Doug and I went off to see two movies up for lead actors in the Academy Awards. Of course they took place last week, and we knew who the winner was, but that didn't stop our enjoyment of the wonderful acting for both... Forrest Whittaker in "The Last King of Scotland", and Peter O'Toole in "Venus." I was happy to see Forrest win as it was obviously much more of a challenge for him to play Idi Amin, than for Peter O'Toole to play a dirty old man lusting after a teenager. All of the acting in both films was just terrific and I enjoyed them both. </p>
<p>We had thoughts about going to the North Bay for a book reading, but it seemed a shame to have to put in two and a half hours, especially since we couldn't even fill it with an early dinner. Two tubs of popcorn with engevita yeast took care of our calories for the day! </p>
<p>Home for a fruit plate, and after a couple of hours of emailing and some reading for me with my tea, we watched the taped Academy Award show. It was long, even with the commercials cut out, and it was after 11 P.M. when we finished. Bed time followed almost immediately... </p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/03/riku_amelia_and_finn_day_1.html">Riku, Amelia, and Finn Day!</a></h2>
								<p>Woke up to Riku lying beside me, slowly coming to at 7:10 A.M., almost a full twelve hours sleep for him. In a groggy voice he told me about his dream, something he always does here when he first awakens. Today it was about being afraid of something shaking and climbing up and up, but he was soon up and running to "beat" me to the bathroom, giggling all the way. He won. </p>
<p>He got dressed immediately, wearing a new "monster truck" long sleeved t-shirt. He was quite intrigued by the sticky label on it that said it was a "size three" and told me he would take it to school. He did, and had it with him when he came out too! </p>
<p>Our morning tradition here is for Riku to watch "Caillou" while I shower, and he eats his fruit while he does so. Then we came downstairs for breakfast, he ate his oatmeal, and had some time to play with Playdoh too. It was a lovely unrushed morning for us both. He even asked Grandpa to trim a hangnail for him, remembering on his own to ask when Doug got up. </p>
<p>At 8:25 we left to pick up Kai, his schoolmate who lives just two blocks from Riku. He also had a shirt on with a big car on it; they looked very cute sitting in the back seat sharing the apple slices I had prepared for Riku. Kai said he liked the yodelling music that Riku listens to every time we are in the car now, but we also saw active cranes, men preparing to roof a building, two trucks with ladders on the backs, and we sang some songs too once the yodelling was through.</p>
<p>We had stopped by to pick up Riku's lunch at his house, and so I got to see smiling Mirei, all dressed in pink today. </p>
<p>It was such a gorgeous morning, sunny and warm, and it seemed a shame to be taking Riku to school. He had said this morning, as he often does at home too, that he didn't want to go to school, but wanted to go to the Bay Area Discovery Museum or Ocean Beach, which I had mentioned the night before. Like Amelia, who also says she wants to go to the zoo or the museum instead of school, they like school once they get there but no doubt miss those days when they were just free to wander about the fun places in the city more frequently.  </p>
<p>When I said goodbye to Riku he said, "Come and get me, OK?" but at the time I had no thought of doing so, assuming that of course I would be home with Mirei. Uneventful morning and early afternoon, filled with the usual busy housework/emails/meals. I was at the front window at 1:55 expecting to see Akane dashing here with Mirei in the stroller, but they were nowhere in sight. At 2:10 Akane called to say she had lost track of time and would have to take a taxi to get Riku. Of course I volunteered to pick him up, and left not too much later so that I could stop by the playground across from Susan's and tell Amelia that we would stop by to play with her. Her preschool ends every Thursday there, which is very handy for Susan, and for us too as we drive right by on the way home. </p>
<p>Riku was just delighted to see me there; his little face lit up and he came cheerfully bounding up the stairs with a big hug and kiss for me. Amelia was ready to go home by the time we reached the park; she has a long busy day at preschool with lots of running around and fresh air time. Riku told me he had played outside for a "little bit" today as well, so in we all went for popcorn, juice, and quiet time together watching "Peter Pan", a new DVD Amelia had only seen once. How Riku loved it; the two of them sat so nicely together watching it, while I had lots of time to hold Finn. </p>
<p>He had been to a gastroenterologist today about his discomfort during and after nursing, and it was confirmed that he has acid reflux problems, and possibly a slightly floppy esophagus. He does much better when he is being held, as I think it's easier to help him relieve any gas build-up if he can be moved around to help his tummy. What a little doll he is; he is actually 13-1/2 pounds already but seems so tiny compared to Mirei I suppose. I calmed him standing in the kitchen chatting with Susan, and then held him while sitting in the living room in the sunshine. He was picture perfect and Susan took some photos for me with my camera. </p>
<p>Riku and I had to go dashing off at 5:15, just as the movie ended, to have the car home for Doug at 5:40 for his T'ai Chi lesson and we just made it. Bryn came down to collect Riku, having been to the dermatologist and the dentist today. Busy day for everyone. </p>
<p>Spent until 10 P.M. with Gail on Skype deleting more folks from our family tree who are too far off the main branches, mostly the parents of people who are not related to us. We can always add them back in, but truly just sticking with our main branches will be enough work for this lifetime! </p>
<p>Emails... and bed before 11... tired tonight.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/03/bryn_bday.html">Bryn's 39!!!!</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn's birth day in Ottawa, all those years ago, couldn't have been more different weather-wise then the way we celebrated it today. The night he was born it was very cold, with severe icy conditions. Gram had walked me out to a cab at midnight, and then I worried about her all the way to the hospital, concerned about her falling. She was sixty-eight at the time, almost sixty-nine, and although in wonderful health, she didn't like the ice any more than I did, and likely was tensed up all the way back to the house!</p>
<p>A dear friend, David, sent through a medley of "Happy Birthday" renditions, which played on the computer; we had those running all through Bryn's party later in the day. There was also a piece for us, for an early anniversary gift... the anniversary waltz, which is just lovely. These are keepers as I will be able to send them on to others too! </p>
<p>We had a high of 26C today! The sun was shining all day, the sky was blue, and we had good reason to celebrate. Which we did, starting with an invitation for breakfast at Jim's, the local greasy spoon in the Mission, one of Bryn's favourite haunts when he's in the mood for eggs and high-gloss hash browns. We all enjoyed it. Riku ate so many of my potatoes that I ordered an extra side of them but am happy to report that we left over half of them there. MIrei helped by wiping the table with not just one, but two napkins, looking very serious about her clean-up duties. What a funny little girl she is. </p>
<p>Bryn had spotted a new place in the Mission featuring home made pies, aptly named "Mission Pies". Bryn thoroughly enjoyed his slice of banana cream, the one his Grandpa Dyment would have ordered for certain. Akane had a walnut pie, and Doug a raspberry pear, but the winner seemed to be the banana cream. Mirei happily crawled and table walked around while Riku and I read two stories. No pie for me... I would have eaten those potatoes if I had been hungry enough. I am a potato gal, more than a pie gal. </p>
<p>Mirei came home with us, for her nap, but first of course it was porridge time for her, with the usual bananas, blueberries, and flax seed added in. She eats the biggest servings of it, all the time pointing to things to play with while she eats. Today I turned her chair around, so that she could see the trees, and the flowers in the garden. The blue jay came by, just in time for Mirei's entertainment. She napped for an hour and a half, which seems to be the standard right now. How she loves to stand up on the bed, and then throw herself down into the pillows; such a feisty little girl! </p>
<p>The few hours up to party time, at 3 P.M., flew by of course. I made Bryn a batch of his favourite granola, tried a new recipe for guacamole, which everyone liked a lot, then a caprese salad, cut up a sweet and juicy pineapple, to go with a big basket of lovely strawberries, which Riku parked himself in front of as soon as they were put on the table. Doug was busy wrapping gifts and making up gift certificates, as well as helping put out food, blowing up lots of balloons, and setting the plants I bought on the front steps. The only thing I didn't get done today was to plant them in the pots on the landing at the front door. </p>
<p>Campbell, a friend of Bryn's from Xoom, arrived first, and helped snip basil over the caprese salad, and then Bryn and family showed up. Riku was tired and hot, but soon got busy playing with Campbell and showing her around. Amelia showed up not too much later, which was great, as the two of them went off to play together... upstairs in the bedroom with the cars, out in the yard with the brooms, sweeping away, and having a little picnic too, while Mirei tried her hardest to sneak outside as well while the back door was open and freedom available! </p>
<p>Mirei loves a party and wandered about being her sweet and cheerful self. The sweetest thing of all was seeing her lean over to give Finn a kiss, all on her own, and just automatically. Apparently it happened twice with someone noticing and she may have snuck in a few extra kisses too. She reminded me so much of Amelia when she was this age, who was such a kisseroo. I have so many photos of that little girl with her lips stuck way out for a kiss, and now here comes another one! How sweet it is... </p>
<p>There were lots of nibbles to eat, everyone moved from one room to another... the living room, the dining room or kitchen, and in Susan's case also the bedroom, to nurse Finn and try to settle him down. I got to hold him a few times, and Doug had him out in the garden too, to settle him and get him to sleep. Susan did manage to get him to nap for quite a long while, as we were all settled in the dining room munching away, but he woke in time to see Bryn open his gifts. Of course Amelia and Riku were as thrilled as always with the singing of "Happy Birthday" and watching the candles get blown out... all 39 of them. </p>
<p>We said our goodbyes to sleepy children by 6:30, all heading home for baths and beds. Doug was busy cleaning up dishes and the table when I came back in and the two of us had the kitchen and dining room in perfect shape within a half hour. I had a non-painful migraine headache all day, with little spots and flashes dancing around the peripheral edges of my eyes, and it had left me feeling a bit disoriented. Perfect timing to just go upstairs with a hot cup of tea, and watch a movie, but I wasn't terribly keen on it, and managed to drift off instead, no doubt doing my eyes a favour anyway. </p>
<p>Chatted with Kelly on Skype IM for a long while, catching up with her for the first time in a while. Caillie had called through to wish Uncle Bryn a happy birthday just as he was cutting the cheesecake, and we could hear her singing away to him. This is the first March break that she and Brynnie have not been here with us, with the exception of the one year they all went to Florida. What amazing weather they would have had for all the trips we usually do... the tide pools, Ocean Beach, Santa Cruz.. They would have loved it as always, and I miss having them here. </p>
<p>Bedtime before midnight, made easier since the clocks were moved forward last night. It is still only 10 P.M. body time, but feels like the 11 o'clock the clock is saying it is! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/03/thursday_sleepover.html">Little Miss Home-Wrecker and a Thursday Sleepover</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei arrived on this gorgeous summer-like day wearing a soft beige top with slightly darker linen pants, such a sweet outfit on our little girl! I couldn't resist taking dozens of photos of her; she was being her usual animated happy self and made it easy for me to do so. </p>
<p>Riku attended a going-away party at a playground near his school today, from 1:30 on, so Mirei was here with us from the noon hour. How she makes her needs known these days! She has always been very good at pointing at things to indicate what she wants, but has now refined it to giving big smiles and nodding when I get it right. In she came today, pointing to the laundry room, and smiling when I asked her if she wanted something in there. Once in the room, I pointed to various things that might interest her; she had already figured that out and just had to be patient with me, until I found the right item. That smile let me know I was on the mark. </p>
<p>Mirei is walking a little bit more each day; crawling is still her main means of moving about, but Bryn wrote later tonight to say she had walked from their bathroom to the kitchen! She has taken thirteen steps here in a row, but I can see she is trying more to walk just in the past two days. I'm not in any rush at all; she will walk when she's ready and meanwhile we enjoy seeing her new crab walk, and the usual arm/foot motions. They will both disappear all too soon. </p>
<p>Bryn feels the same way about the happy babbling from her when he arrives home from work, knowing one day it will be a mere, "Hi Dad". </p>
<p>Doug was downtown working all afternoon, and continued on to his T'ai Chi class following that. But first he took Mirei on her regular "walkabout", something she never forgets to ask for. How does she do this? Well, she gets over to his computer chair, waits for him to notice her, and then starts pointing to one or two of the objects in the dining room on their tour. Her guide is rarely too busy to accommodate her, and knowing she would be off for her nap, and gone before he returned home, it happened earlier than usual today. </p>
<p>Mirei had a longer than usual nap than she has had lately, a full two hours minus perhaps five minutes. She had only napped a half hour at home this morning so was more than ready for it. </p>
<p>We had lots of time for playing upstairs, as of course it is one of the things that Mirei "asks" to do..  she heads for the stairs and then turns to see if it's okay, making rapid headway once I tell her yes. Doug and I have started calling her our little home-wrecker as she does leave a trail of destruction behind her these days. This afternoon she decided to play with all the travel items Doug leaves on a lower shelf; normally she leaves them alone, as she would much rather play with the phone or the tapes. However, today she ended up playing in the middle of a huge mess for the longest time, making sure that every shoe shine cloth came out of every little tiny box, and that everything got thoroughly pulled apart. Ah, bliss! </p>
<p>Akane and Riku didn't show up until after 5 P.M; I had his dinner almost ready for him, thinking I would make up for his too early rising at 5:30 today!  I was hoping for a 7 o'clock bedtime, but with all the distractions at dinner (his sister taking up some of his attention!), an unexpected bath with her, and (after his parents and sister left) stories and teeth brushing, it was 7:30 when I left the room with Riku sleeping. </p>
<p>Gail and I worked through papers on family tree, clearing up some mistakes from previous records done before we had access to the Internet connections. Before I knew it, bedtime for me had arrived too... midnight tonight. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/03/a_perfect_friday_in_march_1.html">You May Kiss My Hand, and a Perfect Ocean Beach Afternoon</a></h2>
								<p>... except that I didn't see Finn as planned; I had suggested a few days ago to Susan that I would love a walk in the park with Finn this morning. However, Akane had a doctor's appointment she had forgotten to tell me about, and so instead Iwent over to pick up Mirei at 10 A.M.  So, back we came to the house, with just enough playtime for Mirei before her big bowl of porridge was ready for her pre-nap snack. She slept for almost two full hours, so I was delighted that I had taken her after all! Neither Akane nor I were sure Mirei would have napped through the appointment.</p>
<p>Mirei had both Doug and me laughing so hard today, as she seemed to make good use of her middle name, Elizabeth, and kept holding her hand, palm down, to Doug's lips so that he could kiss it! Very queenly indeed! It was adorable and she did the same for me too, just not as frequently. When she left with Akane around 2 P.M., Mirei put her hand on one of my cheeks and kissed the other, ever so sweetly. What a dear affectionate little girl she is. Her "babies" get hugged and kissed every time she picks them up.  </p>
<p>Akane came by to pick her up, bringing along delicious veggie spring rolls as a treat; I had eaten lunch, so we each had one and I saved the container of my favourite broccoli and tofu from the Noe Valley Chinese take-away for another time. </p>
<p>As it was such a gorgeous day, I decided that picking Riku up from school for an hour or two at Ocean Beach would be the perfect end to his week at school, and mine at home! Susan said they would try to get there too, and we arranged a spot to meet up. Riku was just delighted to see me; we hadn't planned this at all, and then to hear that we were on our way to Ocean Beach, and Amelia would be there too, just brought bigger and bigger smiles to his face. He came to the door of the school with a paper St. Pat's necklace on, and I wish I had taken a photo of it. </p>
<p>The beach is a mere eight minutes tops from his school, and we sang all the way there. Interesting that Riku more often sings in Japanese now if he is singing on his own, unless he has an English song in his head already, like "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" which pops out now and then. We parked right in front of the steps, across from the Beach House restaurant, sure that we would be easy to spot, despite the huge numbers of people on the beach this hot and sunny afternoon. </p>
<p>We spent two and a half hours there and what fun we had! Riku was quite content to play with his trucks, waiting for Amelia to show up, but after a while we went down to the water's edge to put our feet in, and collect water in two pails. Riku spent lots of time exploring the little rivulets formed by the low tide, and found some interesting shells and stones. The sand there was wet enough to allow us to dig a <strong>very</strong> deep hole, and of course a tall mountain right beside it. I took so many photos of him; I know how much he loves the beach and he knows how much I like it too. It really was the perfect day. </p>
<p>One of the interesting things about Riku is that he is so very willing to make new friends. He is just not shy when it comes to introducing himself and seems very assured that he will happily accepted. The last time we were at the beach he found some new friends, a small group of two men and two women, who invited him to play frisbee with him. This happened today as well; a young couple were playing tossing one about, Riku wandered over and told them his name, and they asked if he would like to play with them. I did call him back after a few minutes, but how he enjoyed joining in. It's adorable. </p>
<p>Later we learned that Susan was expecting a delivery at exactly the time that she hoped they could join us, but with no cell phone, I had no idea why they hadn't showed up. Next time we will pick Amelia up in a situation like this. We were both reluctant to leave, although I knew the chances of Riku falling asleep on the way home were greater with every extra minute we spent there. One day we will stay long enough to watch the sun set, though. </p>
<p>With the yodeling tape playing, and apple slices to munch on, I managed to keep Riku awake... all the way home but for five minutes! Poor wee guy; I picked him up and talked to him and then his daddy came down to carry him upstairs. He waved from the hallway window and then from their living room window, though, and I'm sure he was playing happily with Mirei within minutes. Bryn did write later to tell me he was all ready for bed at 7 o'clock with just stories ahead for him, so this worked out well after all. Whew! </p>
<p>I dropped Riku at 5:45, Gail and I got right to work on our family tree, and at 8:15 we stopped so that Doug and I could watch a rented movie... "Babel", which was excellent. Doug and I both did a little emailing before heading off to bed at midnight.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/03/_and_a_grand_saturday_it_was_b.html">... And a Grand Saturday It Was, Begorra!</a></h2>
								<p>Happy St. Patrick's Day to you all. I called Riku this morning to see if he would like to go on an outing to Pier 39 after a cable car ride. He agreed, but first told me he had an idea... roughly in his words, he said "I think maybe Mommy should not pick me up at school anymore; I think you should pick me up and then we will go to Ocean Beach." I suggested that his mom would miss picking him up so perhaps we could instead have me pick him up on sunny days and go to Ocean Beach and his mom could pick him up on the other days. His thought seemed to be that even on days it was not sunny we could go to Ocean Beach. Yep, he enjoyed yesterday as much as I did, and I really must make an effort to get there with him at every opportunity. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped Riku off for me on his way to work, so that the two of us could have breakfast together before setting out. He had already eaten a banana, and we sat at the table with our bowls of porridge and blueberries. I had asked earlier if he would like an egg and toast breakfast, so to my surprise, after he ate the porridge and I suggested that we leave, he said "I thought I was going to have egg and toast and 'bacon'!" I am not sure where he put it all but all but a quarter of a piece of toast disappeared into that tummy! </p>
<p>As a result, we were later leaving than I hoped, so we decided to skip the cable car ride today, and head right to Pier 39 where we had arranged to meet Doug at 11:30. Riku is such an interesting companion, asking lots of questions along the route... "Why is that man using a cane?", "What does that sign say?", followed by "How does the wheelchair get on the bus?".. and then he actually got to see it happen, just as I had told him. He spotted Chinese signs, and a Japanese restaurant, we told each other which buildings we liked and which we didn't, and why. He doesn't like black buildings or black signs, and wrinkled up his nose as he told me they were "too dark". I agree. </p>
<p>One of the discussions we had was about food, after seeing billboards with lobster and crabs on them. He asked if I liked both of those and in each case I said no. "I like them; you should try them. It's a new taste!"... I could hear his dad coming through very clearly. We went on to talk about meat and chicken; when I told him I didn't like those either, and why (I don't like to kill animals to eat them) his reply was "Why you not like so many things?" and "I like to kill animals; I like to eat them. You should try them."</p>
<p>It's true that Riku has a wonderfully diverse appetite; both he and Mirei eat up almost everything they are given, and if not they are willing to try them. Riku doesn't like black beans, so I finally got to ask him why he didn't like something, but my guess is that one day he will like them and I never will try to eat pork or beef or seafood. I do eat the occasional piece of fish, though, so perhaps that will gain me some points! </p>
<p>Kevin made Bryn a wonderful goulash for his birthday last week, and both children, as well as the parents of course, polished off the stew, the noodles, the dumplings, and the pickled red cabbage too. The night before that they had all eaten chili relleno, highly seasoned pinto beans, salsa, tortillas, and more. It's great, although I do have to turn my head when I see Riku devouring raw fish. </p>
<p>We had a long walk to Pier 39 and Riku was very disappointed not to see the "bush man" I had told him about; this fellow hides behind branches and then jumps out and scares unsuspecting tourists. We will see him another day for sure though. Doug was already at Pier 39 looking at the sea lions, when we arrived, and from there we had Riku on the carousel with Doug. Riku next picked out a special spiny shell from the shell store, and we had lunch at Johnny Rocket's, a 50s style diner. Riku and Doug shared a milkshake, which was just adorable, and each had a grilled cheese sandwich. I enjoyed my veggie burger and fries, the latter a rare treat for me in this city.</p>
<p>The yodeling tape  was going full blast in the car, which managed to keep Riku awake, despite the long trip home: St. Patrick's Day crowds were everywhere. We dashed home with just enough time to check emails and head out again for our 3:05 double feature at the Balboa. The first movie was a lightweight but fun Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore pic called "Music and Lyrics", but the one we were there to see was "Breach", with Chris Cooper and Laura Linney ... wonderfully acted and a very interesting story based on the biggest U.S. spy case in history. </p>
<p>Ate lots of popcorn, so no dinner tonight. I called Jody as soon as I got home and then Gail and I worked on the family tree... of course!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/03/sunday_at_home_1.html">Sunday At Home</a></h2>
								<p>Well, this will be my shortest blog ever. Doug and I spent the entire day in the house, and without one child to distract us from whatever it was we did.... lazy breakfast over the Sunday paper, with lots of emailing on my part, getting my crazily overloaded inbox down from 203 to a mere 156. That took lots of time, though, and I shall continue on until I am back to a reasonable 10 or so; of course I haven't seen that number in years, so wish me luck. </p>
<p>I also caught up on a few blogs, but spent a large amount of time finding the perfect photos for Bryn to add to current and older blogs as well. He has kindly offered to take over the job from Doug, who already spends a huge amount of time just taking care of the huge number of photos I take each day. This is great incentive for me to keep my blogs up, knowing I will be able to add photos of the children to them. </p>
<p>The best part of the day was a long telephone conversation with Kelly. It is so rare for either of us to have the time anymore, but today it worked out for us. We had lots to catch up on, so I put my feet up on the chesterfield, made my afternoon tea, and enjoyed every moment of our hour plus "visit" together. I thought the children were at Aldwych Avenue this weekend, but was wrong, and so will have to talk with the children during the coming week. Uncle Mark had taken the boys and Caillie skiing yesterday though, and they all had a great time. </p>
<p>Gail and I spent two plus hours on the family tree, researching a name I came across by chance a few days ago... Mahala Parcels, born in 1823. What excitement when we realized she was in our direct line, as her father was Richard Parcels. I cannot tell you what a high we are on as we find out more and more about her, her spouse, her siblings, etc. </p>
<p>Doug and I took an hour to watch "Grey's Anatomy", we did some more emailing, and finally turned out the light too late ... at 12:40 A.M.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/03/monday_already_3.html">Monday Already!</a></h2>
								<p>I do my laundry each Monday and the weeks go by so quickly that I feel as though I am doing it every four days! I guess that is a good sign; I'm obviously not bored at all. I would hate for time to drag on and on, but that isn't likely to happen in my case for a long long time. Gail and I often comment that we will have to live to at least one hundred to get all the things done that we have in mind, and if the ages of our ancestors are any indication, then we'll do it! </p>
<p>The morning and early afternoon flew by; the paper got read -- always a plus to have it read in the morning(!) -- the laundry got done, the bedding changed, the house tidied, and I whipped through some more emails as well. </p>
<p>The doorbell rang at 2 o'clock and there was Mirei, looking like Little Red Riding Hood in a new cardigan with a hood. We waved goodbye to her mom from the front door, so Mirei could practice ringing the bell herself. I could tell from the moment she entered the house today that this was a <strong>new</strong> Mirei. It's hard to explain, but it's as though she had entered a brand new stage; she was very verbal, very demonstrative, and walked more than she crawled for the first time ever! Even Doug noticed that she was doing things more aggressively; I think she has decided it's just time to get moving on the next stage and that stage is taking over today! What a delight! </p>
<p>How she loves sitting in the red chair at the little table, and drawing like Riku and Amelia. She pulled it out today, pointed to the seat, and when I asked if she would like to sit, her smile told me that was it exactly. Then that little finger pointed to the crayons, and then the pencil crayons. I am starting to get a nice collection of Mirei art to add to the Amelia and Riku stack. What fun all of this is! </p>
<p>Mirei stood for the longest time in the kitchen, playing with a toy phone, bending down to check something out, but getting right up again. Doug was paying attention to this, as it really was the longest time she had ever stood like that, and a few minutes later she walked all the way from the dry goods cupboard at one end of the kitchen area, to Doug sitting at his computer. It had to be twenty plus steps and we held our breath all the way for her! Even then she didn't sit down, but leaned against him until she was ready to move again. I will miss our little crawler, though, and so will enjoy what I think will be her last few days of this stage. </p>
<p>Even though she was tired, having had only a one hour nap ending at 12:30 at home, and with a tummy full of oatmeal, Mirei decided she just wasn't up to a sleep today at my house. So she puttered happily about, in her bare feet, which meant the walking went even better in the late afternoon, until it was time to leave to walk home at 5:30. Her dad commented on his sleepy girl when we walked in the house, and if we had lived five minutes further away, she would have been sound asleep. </p>
<p>I sat at the table while the children ate the meal Akane had left for them... pasta, steamed broccoli, some shrimp for Riku. They both ate lots but of course that was just a first course for Mirei! She ate beans and rice later on with us, as well as some fruit and tortilla before bed. </p>
<p>Riku showed me his birthday goodies bag from his birthday party and let his sister check some of them out too. He had a tiny notebook and he drew a picture for me, one for his mom and his dad, and then one for Mirei too. Tonight he drew a perfect little heart which he added to the hugs and kisses he now adds to his signature when he's done. Sweet, sweet! </p>
<p>Riku and I snuggled up for a long book before bed, and I think it took him perhaps two minutes before he was sound asleep. I walked out at 7:25, asking Bryn how Mirei had hurt herself. Riku and I thought maybe she had fallen as she was crying hard and long, but instead it was merely a battle of the wills between her and her dad. She was putting a toy in her mouth, despite being warned not to. The second time Bryn warned her, she totally ignored him as though to say "You and whose army is going to stop me?" so he decided to take it from her. She had such a hard grip on it that he really had to work hard to pry it out of her fist(!) ... and then having lost the battle she burst into really hard and loud tears! Yup, that's our girl... feisty, determined, and strong to boot! </p>
<p>Doug arrived with burritos for him and Bryn, and a frozen Chinese takeout from home for me... tofu and veggies. We all shared with Mirei, but first Bryn had to show me how much Mirei enjoys their Robert Bateman pictorial book. He asked her if she wanted to look at the animals. She gave that big smile of hers and quickly crawled over to the bookcase to show him the book. She is a funny girl and grunts to show that she can't do it on her own... does the same thing here with the big kitchen drawers she wants access to... and then happily clambered up to him to sit on his lap and see those animals. It was so cute, and I just had to show Grandpa too, getting exactly the same reaction from her the second time. </p>
<p>Mirei was obviously tired, her tummy was full, Bryn had already changed her into her night clothes, so as soon as dinner was over and the book was checked out again, it was tuck-in time for her too. Bryn was out of her room in less than three minutes, if that! </p>
<p>We spent the next hour just chatting, I did a little blogging, and before we knew it Bryn was leaving to pick up Akane at 9:15. We got home at 9:30 and Gail and I added five more children to the family we were researching last night. Gail managed to contact a distant relative through the World Family Tree who has all sorts of wonderful new information for us in the Parcels line, not all of it a direct link, but no doubt some of it will be very useful... yet another piece in the puzzle...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/03/judith_ocean_beach_and_an_even.html">Judith, Ocean Beach, and an Evening in Larkspur</a></h2>
								<p>As planned last night, I picked up Judith at her hotel in Millbrae at 10:30 A.M. It's another gorgeous day for her visit here, which was wonderful. One rainy day at the beginning of her week in San Francisco was enough! We drove to San Mateo to have lunch at "Amici's"; Judith rarely has pizza and enjoys it, so we happily shared a small pizza with mushrooms, green pepper, grilled onions, and black olives. We took time to wander into a popular Japanese dollar-type store, although with many higher priced items as well. I bought a new broom for the children for a dollar, and Judith found two pottery serving dishes she liked so much for $10 each; she would have bought more, but her carryon suitcase wouldn't hold more extras than this. </p>
<p>From there we drove to Riku's school and picked him up at 2:15, later than we had hoped. He was very happy to find that we were off to Ocean Beach with him, but we had less than an hour there. I set up the camera to get some shots of the three of us, and took some of Judith and Riku fetching a pail of water at the water's edge. The waves were quite high today, but it was just perfect sitting back further on the beach, digging a big hole, Riku's favourite thing to do right now. Judith loves the beach too; it's how we spent so much of our time together when we were young moms.. and now we're young grandmoms. Riku was so sweet with Judith, inviting her to dig with him and commenting on how well she was doing; he has another fan for certain. </p>
<p>We had to dash off long before we were ready, to get Judith back to her hotel in time to meet David. We took a new way to the airport, with Judith navigating, so she was delighted to have seen not only the Sunset district on the way in, but the coastal highway on the way back. Riku napped for about twenty minutes but woke up once I had dropped Judith off. Heaven knows when we will see each other again; it has been three years since our last visit. Emails and online photos, as well as the occasional phone calls, keep us connected though. </p>
<p>Riku wanted to come back home with me, but when I told him his sister would be so excited to see him after a long day without him... at which point I babbled baby talk at him, waving my arms around in excitement... he laughed so hard, over and over, insisting I tell him again what she would do when she saw him, that he happily agreed to go right home. He would only have had fifteen minutes here anyway. I had made plans with Akane to have him home by 5 o'clock, which is exactly when she and a sleeping Mirei showed up from a short stroller ride, and Bryn too, home from work for the weekend. Riku and I spent those ten minutes looking at his book about jelly fish, tucked away out of sight for a couple of months and now happily rediscovered. </p>
<p>I dashed home to check my email and then heading out the door immediately with Doug for Larkspur, where we had dinner and watched a concert at a lovely little dinner theatre. We had a small table for two right in front of the stage, and enjoyed delicious wild salmon burgers with a green salad, and tea for me, before the show. The show consisted of three women: a singer/songwriter from Australia, now living in Bolinas, called Audrey Auld Mezera, a wonderfully talented guitarist (Nina Gerber) whom we saw many many years ago playing with Kate Wolfe at Mariposa and other folk festivals, and a gal (Pam Delgado) we had seen for the first time a few weeks ago at the "West Coast Live" radio show, part of a band called "Blame Sally". They were all very talented and obviously enjoying their time together on stage. The Australian gal sang a song she had written called "I Love You Like the Earth", written for her child, and we bought the DVD so that perhaps I can learn some of the verses to sing to my grandchildren.</p>
<p>Home to read the new book I started just last night, recommended by Judith, and a real page turner! Lights out late!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/03/lots_of_kisses_and_two_movies.html">Lots of Kisses... and Two Movies</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei arrived here for a nap yesterday morning; I had already eaten, read the paper, and even managed to get some birthday cards ready for the mail before Bryn showed up with a tired-looking but happy little girl.</p>
<p>Bryn stayed for a little while, and asked if I how I would feel about taking care of Mirei for two weeks, during the days, from morning until he gets home from work, while Akane and Riku go to Japan... next week! I agreed, and welcome the opportunity to spend more time with Mirei, and with luck get together with Susan and Finn for walks and adventures. I will miss Riku though; I was looking forward to the free days with him during spring break, and he will miss Easter as well. We will just have to decorate eggs and hide goodies when they return.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mirei was going through my cupboards, and did until Bryn left to pick up Akane and Riku for their Saturday trip to Japantown. Soon after it was time for Mirei to eat her second breakfast. It's always best to have this little girl's tummy full before putting her down for a nap. We think that if there is even a little corner empty, then a nap just isn't going to happen! And there always seems to be room for her porridge with banana and berries.</p>
<p>She was asleep within minutes so I tidied up some paper work and did some family tree work with Gail. Mirei napped for just over an hour and a half, ate a big plate of avocado, kabocha squash, a scrambled egg, and some dark greens left over from a selection of Japanese food that Susan had given to me after walking Finn. She fed herself those and the egg, wolfing both down, as though she hadn't been fed for hours. I don't know where she puts it all, but this is a girl who likes her food. </p>
<p>Mirei continues to walk a few steps, sometimes a dozen, before easing herself to the floor for some serious crawling. It occurred to me the other day that she is quite unusual in this way. Usually, once a little one discovers walking, she/he's a walker, but not Mirei; she is happy to be more flexible about her means of transportation.</p>
<p>I keep a little "pusher" called a Miffi Walker in the front bedroom; there are bags of baby clothes on the floor waiting to be sorted, so the door is kept shut most of the time while Mirei is here. However, she knows her walker is in there, and always points to the door to let me know she wants it. Each time she is on her way to bed, she looks down the hallway to point at that room; I always tell her she can use if after her nap and without fail she remembers that. Mirei is happy to push it down the hallway and once in a while into the kitchen, but usually that one short trip with it is enough to satisfy her.</p>
<p>This morning she took a doll our of the big toy basket in the kitchen and sat kissing it. From there she kissed her image in the reflection on the oven door, and then put her little face up to me to kiss as well. While I was feeding her I was also given three or four sloppy kisses and she was pursing her lips towards Doug, who was sitting in the dining room, too far away. Bryn mentioned yesterday that she gives Riku and her mommy lots of kisses but pulls back from his bristly face and beard, as she does with Doug as well. You can see her preparing to pull back; this girl likes her men beardless!</p>
<p>We all met Bryn and family outside the "Four Star" theatre just minutes before our two movies were about to start, at 2:10. They went off to see the new Doering/Ellis home, while we saw two very good movies for the price of one... "The Painted Veil" and "Volver", both very well acted with some gorgeous scenery of China in the first one.</p>
<p>Home close to 8 P.M. after a quick stop for yogurt and bananas, and then two hours with Gail, working on ... our family tree, of course!</p>
<p>Bed at midnight...</p>
