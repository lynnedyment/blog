								<h2>My Name is Caillie and "I am Addicted to Climbing Poles".</h2>
								<p>I woke at 7 a.m. this morning, anticipating my return to Toronto. After rolling a few dollars worth of Uncle Frank's pennies (he estimated he had about fifty pounds worth for me!), reading my emails, and eating breakfast with Lionel, he drove me once again to the bus terminal for my 9:30 a.m. bus. </p>
<p>I arrived at Aldwych Avenue just as Kelly and the children were sitting down on the patio for lunch. I had a delicious bowl of pesto and then we all headed out for the walk to school. We celebrated Caillie's 7th birthday today and I had a request for a chocolate cake with chocolate icing. This was cooling on the racks when Kelly and I went off to pick the children up from school. </p>
<p>Bryn is trying out for the soccer team at school and Uncle Mark and Bryant waited while this took place... successfully, as he made the cut today. I believe there is one more tryout tomorrow. </p>
<p>Caillie had asked me on the way home if we were in a hurry. I told her "no" and she was so pleased as it meant she could climb as many poles as she had the energy for... and that must have been at least twelve poles between there and here! The quote above came just as she appoached the last tall pole before the house and it made me smile; Caillie is just amazing at this skill! She's fast and incredibly efficient... down one, and up the next. </p>
<p>Myk' was busy doing scads of homework when we got home, so Caillie practiced the piano and then settled in for a nice leisurely tub, which she sorely needed. The feet! The knees! She's a busy girl! </p>
<p>Kelly got busy preparing Caillie's meal of choice for her birthday, a tofu and broccoli stir-fry. It was delicious and everyone enjoyed it, as there isn't a bite of it left for tomorrow. </p>
<p>We ate on the patio again tonight as it was so lovely outside. Mark joined us and brought Caillie's favourite chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream to go along with the cake. </p>
<p>Bryn and Myk' took turns giving Caillie her gifts; she was delighted with all of them... the clothes, the books, the crafts, and the certificate for a book, a CD, two new Barbies, and/or a toy from her favourite toy store on the Danforth. </p>
<p>It was getting dark by the time we finished up, so the children went off to bed, the adults watched a bit of a video Mark brought over, and then we were all tired and ready to go to bed too. Kelly and Gregg are up already, and I am ready to call it a day as well. Happy Birthday, Caillie!</p>
