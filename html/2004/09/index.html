								<h2><a href="/2004/09/last_day_with_riku_for_too_lon.html">Last Day with Riku... for Too Long!</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn dropped off my smiley little guy this morning so that his Mommy could get all her packing done and get a good sleep tonight, for their long long trip to Japan tomorrow. I was delighted to have this day with him, as all the laundry is done, the house is looking just fine, and all I really have to do is pack. </p>
<p>I made Riku a full portion of four grain cereal and I finished up my hot chocolate; Riku enjoys looking at magazines and/or the paper while he has breakfast, so it's a very pleasant half hour together. Riku wanted to stay there when he finished, so I gave him the button box to play with on the table. Today he had a big flat plastic container for them too, and spend his time transferring them from the box to the container and back again. Once again he handed over any buttons with thread in the holes for me to "cut?". </p>
<p>Nap time followed, and Riku headed off to turn on the "ocean" sound in his room while I shut the blinds. He is more than happy to crawl up into his bed at naptime, as he knows exactly what the routine is. I hold him  in my arms and he asks for his animals... the monkey, two dogs, and two mice. Always. There is no room for more than these; his arms are full as he drifts off to sleep. I take all but the monkey and one dog from him before I put him down, although often I tuck one under his leg or foot for comfort. </p>
<p>Forty minutes later, on the dot as usual, he awoke and while I made some puddings, banana bread, and granola, Riku wandered in and out of the garden. Once again I put out his snacks and his chair for him; it is really sweet to see him learning how to boost himself up into the chair that is just a tad too high for him. He perseveres though, and is successful each time now. He walked the beam again today and I videotaped him doing so, for posterity. </p>
<p>I had glasses to pick up so decided that Riku could nap in his stroller while I ran errands. We were out for three hours and walked a very long distance, a perfect thing to do the day before a long plane trip. It was hot on the walk; I told Riku we were going home and he asked first for "water?" and I said "sure" knowing he wanted to play in the yard, and next came "hose?", not quite so clearly as "water", but understandable. I bent down to tell him yes, and he told a little story by saying "trees?" and pointing both hands held together upwards. Yes, by all means he could water the trees, and then he put his hands on his head, grinned and nodded, and yes, I too remembered the last time when he managed to get himself all wet. Communication is improving every single day now. Riku was out in just his diaper and rubber sandals today and looked adorable, watering everything in sight. </p>
<p>Tub time came next and a hair wash for both Robin and Riku. It's much easier for Riku to have his hair washed if we do Robin's first and it's fun too, as Riku does the rinsing. Next came a big dinner once again of whole wheat pasta with spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes, followed by a big portion of homemade applesauce and half a cookie. I think Riku is going through a growth spurt, as he is happy to eat something fairly hearty every two or three hours. </p>
<p>Akane, Bryn, and Brent came over at 7 p.m., just as the brownies were coming out of the oven, to take us out for dinner at a taqueria we all like a lot and rarely go to; Bryn's treat tonight. It was very nice not to think about what I was going to eat tonight; the day was busy enough. Our food was delicious; Riku is very fond of tortilla chips and had a couple of bites of a quesadilla too. That tummy is very round these days! </p>
<p>It was very difficult saying goodbye to Riku; I can't imagine not seeing him for six weeks and he will change so much. He knows he is going on a big plane with his mommy tomorrow but he doesn't know how far away it is taking him from us. </p>
<p>And here I sit writing, and I should be upstairs packing. I'm not going to make my midnight deadline as, instead of finishing up the kitchen work, I phoned two friends to say goodbye and then went out at 10:30 p.m to sweep the patio! That made so much sense too, as I won't see it for a month! The cool air felt good though, and as soon as I get the dishes finished up I shall go upstairs and pack. </p>
<p>Susan and Amelia will be here to pick me up at 8:30 a.m. for my 10:20 flight to Buffalo. This worked out very nicely indeed as I get to see Amelia again too; she just might be walking the next time I see her! In fact, I could bet on it.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/an_amazing_coincidence_and_the.html">An Amazing Co-Incidence and the Rest of My Day</a></h2>
								<p>Just after finishing a breakfast of perfectly poached eggs, sauteed Ontario tomatoes, and whole wheat Italian toast, here at Gerry and Lionel's this morning, the phone rang. It was a cousin of Lionel's from Mississauga calling to chat and to catch up on summer news. At one point Gerry handed the phone over to me, as she had told this gal that her cousin Lynne was visiting from San Francisco. Since she has a son in SF, she was curious as to where I lived. Sooo, we chatted a bit, her son lives on Delores Street, she occasionally visits so we arranged that the next time she was there she would give me a call and we could spend some time together. Her son works, and has no family there, so she spends her days wandering about on her own. I asked where her son works and was told at Sony downtown. Hmmm, interesting, I told her, as I knew two fellows his age who also worked at Sony and suggested she get a piece of paper and pen and write the names down as perhaps her son knew them. The first was Sean Coady and the second Brent Williams. Brent Williams she asked? Yes. Well, Brent was her son!!!!! </p>
<p>I'm telling you, we were all just astounded at this incredible co-incidence! Jackie Williams mother and Lionel's mother were sisters! She couldn't believe that Bryn Dyment was MY son as she has met him and been outside my house and on and on we went. I told her we had had a picnic together last Sunday and promised to send her photos via email, and I sent a second album too, in which Akane and Brent are in the kitchen cooking. Is this amazing???? </p>
<p>Following this astounding event, I drove over to Uncle Frank's and spent three and a half hours with him. We were both busy, he with photo related computer jobs while I did some sorting for him. </p>
<p>At 6 p.m. Gerry, Lionel, and I arrived at Marie and Graham's for a barbecue dinner... two types of macaroni salad, a really delicious potato salad, baked beans, pork chops for everyone else, and a very tasty spinach filled "cutlet" for me. </p>
<p>Graham brought out a big box of chocolate covered ice cream on a stick for part of our dessert, which really hit the spot. </p>
<p>It was a lovely night for sitting outside; the day had been hot and humid but the back yard was just perfectly comfortable until the mosquitos started to bite. In we went for a cup of tea and banana bread for those who wanted extra dessert, and then we headed for home, watched some t.v. while I soaked my feet in a foot bath and scrubbed away at my feet. Ahhh, very relaxing and now I should head off to bed.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/labour_day_in_canada.html">Labour Day in Canada</a></h2>
								<p>I had a long relaxing morning at Gerry and Lionel's today. After a very light breakfast, in anticipation of a buffet lunch at the new casino, I helped Gerry enter some email addresses in her computer, wrote a few emails, and made a few phone calls. I was trying hard to get in touch with my brothers, to no avail, although I did reach Wendy. She and Glenn were on their way to London to take Steph's boyfriend to school; too bad as they could have joined Uncle Frank, Gerry, Lionel, their friend Doreen, Beth, Paul, and I for the brunch. We picked Uncle Frank up and were in line for brunch by noon hour. This was Uncle Frank's first visit to the new casino. </p>
<p>Lunch was great. There is a very large selection of food and it was very well done with plenty to choose from. I had a big plate of various salads and finished off with a big bowl of delicious strawberries, another of mixed fruit, and a very tiny slice of cherry pie. We took our time and left just two hours after arriving. </p>
<p>I drove out to Amy and Jake's for a long visit with Amy. Jake was off to Hamilton for the annual Labour Day football game between Hamilton and Toronto. Amy and I spent from 3 p.m. until 11 p.m. catching up on all our news and eating all the various and delicious food Amy had prepared... a tomato and boccocino salad, a big mixed vegetable salad, an eggplant, tomato, and onion casserole, followed by a small dish of vanilla ice cream, strawberries and chocolate sauce... and a big pot of tea. Such a very very relaxing day and evening this was. </p>
<p>On the way home I drove by Uncle Frank's to see if his lights were on. The office and rec' room lights were still lit and I was very tempted to drop in but... it <strong>was</strong> 11:15 so I drove on by. Just as well as he had found a nice big stack of photos he knew I would enjoy looking at, and I would have been there until 2 a.m.! He has promised to put them aside, smoking... as he put it, until I am back in town next week. I was happy to know it was safe to call him so late and able to say goodbye until next week; I am leaving for Toronto a day earlier than I planned. </p>
<p>Only one and a half more days until I see my Toronto grandchildren!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/niagara_falls_to_toronto.html">Niagara Falls to Toronto</a></h2>
								<p>Kelly, looking long and lean and as healthy as can be (she was at the gym at 6:30 this morning), arrived to pick me up this morning at 10:50. I was ready to leave for Toronto about twenty minutes later, just as it started to drizzle a bit. Off we went to Beth's to deliver some clothes Kelly had brought for Alysa and Elizabeth. Stopped at Costco and bought some birthday and Christmas! gifts. How wonderful to have a head start at these; I plan to do the wrapping while I'm here. December won't be quite so rushed and my bags not quite so heavy. </p>
<p>Home about 2 p.m. to fix up a sandwich and chat a bit while putting away all the Costco groceries and hiding the gifts downstairs. </p>
<p>At 3:30 we were waiting at the school for the children to finish their first day of the new school year. They are late going back this year and the boys weren't convinced it was delayed as much as it should have been! Summer just wasn't long enough for either of them. However, both Mykayla and Caillie are thrilled to be back. </p>
<p>Bryant spotted us as soon as he was out the door, and came over with that shy smile of his. His hair is long and shaggy right now; he is looking very handsome and more like his dad to me. He doesn't mind a bit that his hair is now longer than his sister's. </p>
<p>Caillie came bursting out with big hugs for her Mom and finally spotted me; I was then the lucky recipient of so many of her sweet big hugs and was told  several times that she really really missed me. Caillie is long and lean, just like her Mom, and is as lovely as always. </p>
<p>Mykayla joined our group as well, and looks just fantastic with her new short hairdo; it really suits her and she has some bright burgandy highlights in it, which really suits her. Myk' looks like her Mom too and her Mom is a very pretty woman. </p>
<p>Brynnie was so sweet, and after giving me a nice big hug, told me I still smelled the very same; he has always been so aware of scents and I know this is important to him. Brookie always said the same thing. Must be that Keri lotion! Bryn is wider through the chest and was looking pretty cool in his black baggy pants, hanging down and dragging on the ground just a tad... the way they were supposed to do, I was informed.</p>
<p>Bryn and Caillie are with their dad until tomorrow at noon, and so off we went with Manitou, Myk', and Bryant. While Kelly picked up Gregg, we played a game of Sorry; it is fun to be back and just hanging out with them again. It does seem a long time since we have been together. We chatted about ghosts, and what things we will do in San Francisco next year, and of course Riku and Amelia. </p>
<p>I caught up on emails while Gregg made dinner. How wonderful is that?! We ate outside and I enjoyed every single bite of my pasta with freshly made pesto, a cob of Ontario corn, and a delicious barbecued portobello mushroom. Yummy indeed! What a treat to be <em>called</em> to the dinner table, and not be doing the calling. </p>
<p>Myk' and I had just enough time for a game of Aces before she went up to bed and then I sat and emailed madly. I may even get caught up before leaving here on Sunday. Kelly and Gregg were watching tv beside me, and we chatted during commercials catching up on more of our news. </p>
<p>Off I go to bed... looking forward to getting into bed earlier than usual the past few nights and perhaps finishing off my book.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/another_day_in_toronto.html">Another Day in Toronto</a></h2>
								<p>Caillie and I were wakened by Gregg at 7:30 a.m. today. We were both in a sound sleep, possibly lulled by the sound of the pounding rain outside our window. Gregg dropped the children at school at 8:30 so Kel' and I didn't have to face the downpour. </p>
<p>Vicki called this morning and we had a good long chat, mostly doula related, and caught up on some of our news. We plan to get together next week when she will be in town for a few days. </p>
<p>By noon the rain was just a drizzle; I made tuna sandwiches and tuna melts for lunch, with of course the usual big plate of carrots, celery, and cucumber, a standard at this house. </p>
<p>Bryn made a very sweet comment today; he said how happy he was that Auntie Susan and Amelia were part of our family still. We agreed with him, of course. The children are looking forward to seeing both Riku and Amelia when they visit San Francisco next year; they all seem to be as crazy about little ones as the rest of us. Must run in the family! Off to walk the children to school with just a light rain jacket on. </p>
<p>It was a pretty lazy afternoon for me and I was ready for it. I made a double recipe of Akane's favourite cranberry oatmeal cookies and then answered emails. By the time 3:30 rolled around there was no need for a jacket at all. The sun was out and shining brightly enough that Kelly and I regretted not bringing our glasses along. What crazy weather we had today! </p>
<p>Uncle Mark met up with us walking home; he had been at his parents for a week, so Caillie demonstrated her new pole climbing ability to him, and she showed me how she can hang from UM's one arm! I dashed out with the video camera and the digital camera to record Caillie's very impressive skills.</p>
<p>All the children played outside and ran off some energy after school. It was Caillie's turn to throw the ball to Manitou for ten minutes, although she was out in the back lane for more than twenty minutes. Uncle Mark was with her and I think the time just flew by for her. </p>
<p>She and I went off at 5 p.m. to have dinner out alone together at Il Fornello. It was a perfectly wonderful dinner; Caillie ordered and ate all of her margherita pizza and cranberry juice, as well as half of the Italian bread, and I had a most delicious wild mushroom and arugula salad with the bread that Caillie didn't finish. I had to be quick though! </p>
<p>Caillie did her piano practice while I answered emails upstairs, and then, after helping her with her shower and shampoo session, I had a long chat with Carol Woods, who called at the perfect time. We are hoping to get together on Saturday. </p>
<p>A little msn'ing with Bryn finished off my day; I'm heading up the stairs to bed. Time: 11 p.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/friday_night_the_weekend_is_al.html">Friday Night ... the Weekend is Almost Here!</a></h2>
								<p>Busy as usual morning... quick shower, and a brisk walk to school at 8:30 a.m. The boys stayed at school for lunch today so it was Kelly, Myk', Caillie, and I only; seemed very quiet. Back to school in enough time that Caillie had time to climb a couple of poles; so funny to see how keen she is... and so good at it too. </p>
<p>Kelly is making an album for Bryn's soccer coach and got started at it this afternoon. I went down and joined her, wrapping all the Christmas gifts I bought as well as Caillie's and Bryn's birthday gifts. Those days are always busy so it's great having this job done.</p>
<p>And the rest of the day flew by in a busy blur... Bryn's friend Sean had a practice after school, and since he was coming here with his brother Sam for a sleepover we all waited in the playground for him to finish... at almost 5 p.m! The rest of the children played with Manitou while we waited, and they were all very hungry when we finally arrived at home. </p>
<p>The children all ran around outside when we got home so I went upstairs for a half hour of quiet reading time. Kelly had gone dashing off to do some photo copying for the album, Gregg came home and worked on the project too, and Sandy, Corey, and Allie ran into busy Friday night traffic and arrived an hour later than they planned to... which worked out very well here, as we were running late too.</p>
<p>Gregg out together a great dinner of burritos/tacos with refried beans, guacomole, tomatoes, lettuce, ground beef, and sour cream. The evening had turned cool and somehow all twelve of us managed to gather around the table for dinner. Sandy had picked up a big jug of Ontario cider and two delicious pies... bumbleberry and strawberry rhubarb, which finished off our dinner very nicely! </p>
<p>Corey, Allie, Kelly, and I all hoped to play cards but it didn't happen; I did see Corey's album of her first year at University last year and since she leaves for Peterborough tomorrow there will be new photos up on ofoto soon I hope. </p>
<p>After dinner we watched part of the Riku/Amelia tape; the children, as well as Sandy, Corey, and Allie were just thrilled to bits to see Riku dancing and to see Amelia standing and going up the stairs. They can't wait to see Riku at Christmas and the children look forward to visiting with them both in the spring. </p>
<p>Bed at midnight after a quick cleanup in the kitchen... the children were awake until 10:30 p.m. !!! so no doubt we will have a tired crew tomorrow.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/saturday_games_and_two_parties.html">Saturday Games and Two Parties</a></h2>
								<p>Today started off busy... everyone (all nine of us after a too-late-to-bed for the children) dashing to get out the door for a 10:30 a.m. soccer game start. We had to make two trips to the field as there were more of us than seats in the van. Gregg and I went off with Sam, Sean, Bryn, Myk' and Bry'; I drove back to the house, while Kelly finished showering, and then I packed up enough food to feed us over the course of three games. Caillie joined us on the return trip to the field. </p>
<p>It was a great day; Bryn's team won all three of the games and in between cheering we ate, took photos, and the children played in the playground... lots of photo opportunities today. </p>
<p>Back home with just a little over an hour to take a deep breath, get Caillie ready for a birthday party/sleepover and for the rest of us to head out to Whitby for a party. This was held by a friend of Gregg's, the occasion being his daughter's seventh birthday party. Bry', Myk' and Bryn had a great time in the pool and spent most of the afternoon and early evening in the water. The adults sat around on the deck chatting and eating great food... grilled portobello mushrooms, oven-grilled zucchini with parmesan cheese, huge salad, lots of vegies, and birthday cake. </p>
<p>Gregg's friends are quite outrageous and zany, going to great lengths to embarrass each other for our entertainment. It was fun finally putting faces and personalities to the people I've been hearing about for over two years. I also spoke for some time with a lovely warm woman from Glasgow and exchanged some family history. </p>
<p>Home by 9 p.m. and hustled the children right to bed; Bryn was particularly tired after three games of running around in the heat. The adults too crashed early and we all headed up to bed by 11:30 p.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/sunny_sunday_in_toronto.html">Sunny Sunday in Toronto</a></h2>
								<p>Everyone slept in much later than usual today due to our busy day yesterday. The house roused at 8:45 a.m. although ambitious Kelly had awakened at 6 a.m. and gone off to the gym! I was very impressed. </p>
<p>It was a bit of a rush getting out of the house for 10:30 for Bryn's soccer game but we made it, and had time to pack snacks and sandwiches too. What a treat it was to see Brad Gerster there as well; Rebecca had a game scheduled following ours and Jane and Becca came over for a visit with us all. It was lovely catching up on their news and Jane's trip to Victoria this summer. Tracy and Becca eventually joined us too. </p>
<p>Bryn's team unfortunately lost by one point, but the team was happy to have gotten so far along this term. We packed up and went to the other field to watch Becca's team play half their game, and then left for home. Gregg and Kelly surprised us all by pulling into a Dairy Queen for "blizzards". We sat outside at a table with a view of the hills and relaxed before heading home. </p>
<p>We played some games... Myk' and I played two games of Chinese Checkers, Caillie and I played Hi-Ho CherryO, and so the afternoon passed. The children had piano practice, and Manitou needed some outside playtime, while Gregg prepared chicken, corn, and portobello mushrooms on the barbecue and a big Caesar salad for dinner. </p>
<p>Caillie was in bed by 8 p.m. and the others followed shortly after. It was very, very humid tonight, and Kelly eventually turned on the air-conditioner, which improved my life immmensely! They have had a cool and rainy summer here, and all the good weather and high humidity waited for my visit. I was quite looking forward to Fall in Ontario but there are very few leaves changing colour so far. </p>
<p>Bed at 10:30 tonight; got lots of reading done... finished my book and went searching through the shelves for one of Kelly's.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/toronto_to_niagara_falls.html">Toronto to Niagara Falls</a></h2>
								<p>Awake at 7 a.m. Caillie still sleeping so I crept downstairs and hit the shower first. Quickly packed up my very full bag for the trip to the Falls; Bryn and Bry' had donated some toys for Riku and Caillie had a few things from her room as well, so the bag was heavier than i thought it would be on the return trip. Luckily, Gregg was driving to work so, just as I was heading out the door at 8:30 with the children, Gregg offered to drive me to the bus terminal. I was awfully glad not to be lugging the bag downtown during the morning rush hour. </p>
<p>Lionel, my old stand-by, was at the terminal in the Falls to pick me up at 11:20 a.m., and dropped me off at Beth's. I was famished and had an egg, toast, and tea before we played Aces and Double Sixes. What a perfect way to start my day. I left at 1:40 p.m. to walk to Uncle Frank's; there was no answer but he knew I would be over so I decided to head out. Arrived at 2:20, just as Uncle Frank came in from having lunch. </p>
<p>The first hour we just chatted in the bedroom whilst going over hand-written family notes from Auntie Rita; once again tried to find another piece of the ongoing puzzle that is the Lee family. There were photos to look at and a few things to decide on and then we got down to business... going through the attic space and clearing it out. Uncle Frank insisted on going up the ladder and remarked that it was 200F degrees up there! Despite this, he hauled down carefully packed-away evening dresses, Christmas wrap, old Samsonite suitcases and various travelling bags and lots of dust! This was a great job to have finished though, and we were both so pleased. </p>
<p>We called it quits for the day, stopped for a cold drink and some sliced peaches and blueberries, and chatted for a bit, before I headed off to walk to Gerry and Lionel's and Uncle Frank went to By' and Josie's for dinner. </p>
<p>I had left a message for Gerry saying I would be "home" for dinner but they didn't get it and were out with friends, so I had four very quiet hours on my own... made a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich for my dinner, looked through every one of the summer photos of Gerry and Lionel's visit with the seven grandchildren from Calgary, did some emailing, and chatted on the phone with Candy and Marie. </p>
<p>Went off to bed very early, which was a treat, after catching up on our day with Gerry and Lionel. Lights out at 10:45.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/busy_day_back_in_niagara_falls.html">Busy Day... Back in Niagara Falls</a></h2>
								<p>Started off with a busy day and ended with one too. I was up early for a shower before everyone else got up. Downstairs to make hot cereal for the children, tidied up the kitchen and packed a small suitcase for my trip to the Falls. I caught the 9:30 bus, dozed and went through a couple of Prevention magazines before arriving just before 11:30. </p>
<p>Lionel, my old stand-by, was there to drop me off at Beth's. We played a few games of cards and then I left her to get ready for work, while I walked to Uncle Frank's. It was threatening rain, and Lionel said he would pick me up if it did rain, but it held off and I enjoyed a forty minute walk over to Uncle Frank's. </p>
<p>Got lots done in just a few hours... went through a huge amount of clothing, sorted it into boxes, and have it ready to take away tomorrow morning when I will have the car. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank invited me to have dinner with him, Josie, By', and one or two of the girls but instead I walked over to Sheldon Street, hoping to spend a few hours with Gerry and Lionel. The house was empty when I walked in, I left a message on Gerry's cell phone, but soon realized they wouldn't be home for dinner. I had a tomato sandwich, leafed through a magazine, but soon realized I was tired and decided to go to bed early after checking my emails. </p>
<p>Gerry and Lionel walked in just as I was going down to bed; they were out with Cheryl and Kenny, planning a cruise together in October! How exciting for them all! </p>
<p>Slept so well and had a really good night's sleep.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/monday_busy_monday.html">Monday, busy Monday</a></h2>
								<p>Breakfast with Lionel at 8 a.m., after answering a few emails and rolling some pennies from Uncle Frank's vast coin collection. Uncle Frank called at 10 a.m. to say he was on his way out for coffee, so I dashed over to Beth's for a couple of games of cards. She was busy making chili for Paul's hunting trip, he leaves tomorrow, so Beth was glad to take a little break. </p>
<p>Over to Uncle Frank's and found him napping soundly. Quietly put everything in the car we had collected the day before, and stashed in the front hall,  and headed out to the Legion (the woman in the office there said I didn't need to introduce myself, that it was obvious I was Rita Massard's daughter), on to the bulk bin store, to Queen Street to the Nearly New shop with suitcases and Christmas baskets, and finally back for a late lunch with Uncle Frank. </p>
<p>We headed out to one of the Stamford Green plazas to "Papa Nick's Deli", owned by Gerry and Lionel's nighbour. Uncle Frank had a generous portion of spaghetti with meat sauce and garlic bread ($3.99!) and since there was nothing vegetarian available I had a side order of roasted mixed vegies, and one of roasted potatoes, another very generous portion for $1.50. Uncle Frank is always looking for a new place to eat, so he just might return one day. </p>
<p>We went back to the house for a cool drink (It was very humid outside), and while we chatted in the kitchen I gave the fridge a wipe over and made up some instant chocolate pudding and lemon jello, both of which UF enjoys. He was also very pleased with the unsalted and unroasted cashew and almonds I picked up for him; a healthy snack which he can nibble on when he's peckish. </p>
<p>I had made plans with Gerry to go with her to her weekly WW's meeting in St. Catherines, and sat through the meeting listening to all of the weight loss stories... the woman in front of us has lost 178 pounds so far! </p>
<p>Of course, always after a weigh-in, everyone is ready for a good meal, so off we went to our old favourite standby, "Lina Linguine's" where we shared a portion of eggplant parmigiana and a very big and tasty salad. </p>
<p>I drove over to Beth's to drop off the remainder of the Rubbermaid containers and some things she or someone in the family might have a use for. Dropped in at the bingo hall to tell Beth they were in the back yard (Paul was out), said goodbye to her until the weekend and went over to Uncle Frank's for an hour and a half. We just sat in the kitchen and chatted about this, that, and the other, as Mom would say, and it was very pleasant. </p>
<p>Back to Gerry's and Lionel's about 10:30 p.m., checked my emails, wrote a couple of fast ones and headed off to bed and to read my book. Lights out at 12:10 p.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/my_name_is_caillie_and_i_am_ad.html">My Name is Caillie and "I am Addicted to Climbing Poles".</a></h2>
								<p>I woke at 7 a.m. this morning, anticipating my return to Toronto. After rolling a few dollars worth of Uncle Frank's pennies (he estimated he had about fifty pounds worth for me!), reading my emails, and eating breakfast with Lionel, he drove me once again to the bus terminal for my 9:30 a.m. bus. </p>
<p>I arrived at Aldwych Avenue just as Kelly and the children were sitting down on the patio for lunch. I had a delicious bowl of pesto and then we all headed out for the walk to school. We celebrated Caillie's 7th birthday today and I had a request for a chocolate cake with chocolate icing. This was cooling on the racks when Kelly and I went off to pick the children up from school. </p>
<p>Bryn is trying out for the soccer team at school and Uncle Mark and Bryant waited while this took place... successfully, as he made the cut today. I believe there is one more tryout tomorrow. </p>
<p>Caillie had asked me on the way home if we were in a hurry. I told her "no" and she was so pleased as it meant she could climb as many poles as she had the energy for... and that must have been at least twelve poles between there and here! The quote above came just as she appoached the last tall pole before the house and it made me smile; Caillie is just amazing at this skill! She's fast and incredibly efficient... down one, and up the next. </p>
<p>Myk' was busy doing scads of homework when we got home, so Caillie practiced the piano and then settled in for a nice leisurely tub, which she sorely needed. The feet! The knees! She's a busy girl! </p>
<p>Kelly got busy preparing Caillie's meal of choice for her birthday, a tofu and broccoli stir-fry. It was delicious and everyone enjoyed it, as there isn't a bite of it left for tomorrow. </p>
<p>We ate on the patio again tonight as it was so lovely outside. Mark joined us and brought Caillie's favourite chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream to go along with the cake. </p>
<p>Bryn and Myk' took turns giving Caillie her gifts; she was delighted with all of them... the clothes, the books, the crafts, and the certificate for a book, a CD, two new Barbies, and/or a toy from her favourite toy store on the Danforth. </p>
<p>It was getting dark by the time we finished up, so the children went off to bed, the adults watched a bit of a video Mark brought over, and then we were all tired and ready to go to bed too. Kelly and Gregg are up already, and I am ready to call it a day as well. Happy Birthday, Caillie!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/a_long_leisurelybut_humid_day.html">A Long Leisurely(but Humid!) Day...</a></h2>
								<p>It felt a little cooler this morning, so I made oatmeal for the children for breakfast. Myk' and Bry' weren't convinced they would like it, but with a sprinkle of cinnamon on it, they ate every bite of it. </p>
<p>Kelly and I headed out the door at 9:15 to walk with Camila, Manitou, and Jake, Manitou's neighbourhood friend. We were out for two hours and twenty minutes, strolling along the Don River, while the dogs romped about in the muddy water and along the dusty trails, enjoying their freedom. Next week I will take the camera along.</p>
<p>A fast walk to school to collect the children, a leisurely half hour on the patio while the children enjoyed their grilled cheese sandwiches and birthday cake lunch, and then I dashed off again to meet Tracy on the Danforth for a very tasty lunch, her treat!, at a Japanese restaurant. I had tempura vegetables and tempura tofu (sans bonito flakes), which were all delicious. Tracy surprised herself by eating a nice big tray of chicken and other assorted tidbits. We chatted, catching up on our lives, condensed into a short one and a half hours!, and then returned to our busy day. Tracy was on call but we lucked out and weren't interrupted. </p>
<p>The rest of the day and evening passed quickly... big snack outside for all of the children, after a short burst of rain earlier... piano practice for Bry' and Myk', then Myk' and Caillie did one of Caillie's birthday crafts... piano lessons for Bryn and Caillie, quite a few games of "Guess Who" with both Bryn and Caillie (Myk' and Bry' went off with their mom at 5:45 p.m.),and finally a late, light dinner of Gregg's homemade chicken soup and sourdough toast for the others, while I ate an egg and toast. </p>
<p>Bryn hurt his knee today during the school soccer try-outs today, and we are hoping it will be healed enough by tomorrow that he can try again tomorrow. </p>
<p>At bedtime, while Kelly read to Caillie, I read Bryn two chapters of a book about grizzlies I bought for his birthday last year; however, upon reaching the point where the farmer finds one of his bulls injured, takes his rifle and searches until he finds the mother grizzly and her four cubs, Bryn decided that was a very good point to stop. He wasn't going to risk hearing something sad before going to sleep. What a wise boy this is (I looked ahead!). I read a few pages from another book while he waited for his mom to come down and tuck him in. </p>
<p>Chatted with Carol on the phone, wrote some emails... and off I go to bed at 10 p.m.... or soon!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/happy_birthday_caillie.html">Happy Birthday Caillie</a></h2>
								<p>Caillie turned seven today; she had birthday pancakes and a Happy Birthday song to acknowledge her special day, before heading off to school. </p>
<p>Kelly and I drove the Bryn and Caillie to school, and then Gregg to work, where I had a tour of his lovely office; Daniel Lanois lives right across the street from this old renovated stable and then a residence, before being converted to an office building. Interior brick walls, large open spaces, and a deck make this one of the most appealing offices I have seen. </p>
<p>Kel' and I thought we would look for loot bag goodies in Chinatown but alas, nothing opened until 11 a.m., not even the bakery where we walked to buy tofu buns while waiting for the regular retail stores to open. Finally we managed to find some great containers for Bryn's party and bowls for the girls, as well as items to put in them. </p>
<p>Lunch at La Commensal was a real treat. I bought a huge plate of food and brought more than two thirds of it back home for extra meals. I have a hard time not choosing every vegie dish on the buffet table. </p>
<p>The dollar store was next where we finished the loot bags, then a quick trip to the grocery store for snacks for the party, and finally home. It was chilly today so at least we weren't rushing around and walking in the humidity of the last few days. </p>
<p>Myk' and Bry' were here with us until 5:30, and after piano practice there was time for Bry' to beat me in a game of "Guess Who" and another game which was new to me... can't recall the name now. I had hoped to have had dinner with Carol tonight but she wasn't able to make it, and Kelly and Gregg had dinner plans with friends as well, which were also cancelled. So, it was a quiet night at home for all of us; we watched some t.v., had some take-out food for dinner in front of the t.v. and I turned in after the two hour Oprah biography show. It was cold and I was happy to be in bed snuggled up reading.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/two_birthday_parties.html">Two Birthday Parties</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn's early birthday party was held at Hans' today whilst Caillie's was held at Kelly's and Gregg's, both from 2 p.m.-4:30. This morning, Gregg set up a stage on the back deck for the "Rock Star" event for Caillie, complete with backdrop, a poster, and a white board with the names of the "stars". Backstage was a karaoke machine and lots of cd's. I made chocolate cupcakes, Kelly and I put together the loot tumblers and bowls and they looked great, and all was ready for eight little girls by 2 p.m. </p>
<p>At Kelly's, the girls came in, some got right into the makeup while others chose some special clothes to wear. Meanwhile, at Bryn's party, he was being decorated with whipped cream and toppings, on his chest and face, which the guests dug into after they finished the job! I missed out seeing this but Hans did show me a few photos... weird stuff!!!! :) Bryn was beaming though and obviously enjoyed it all; he loves a party even if he is the "cake"! </p>
<p>The rock show started off a little quietly as the girls took some time to warm up but eventually they did and by the end of the last session most of the girls were on stage as back up singers and dancers. Kelly made a tape and it will be lots of fun to see that next week when I am back in Toronto. </p>
<p>Things were winding down nicely by 4:15 so we got everything cleaned up and organized in time to leave the house at 6 p.m.... me to the bus terminal for a 6:30 bus to Niagara Falls and Kelly and Gregg to a dinner party and club night in Oakville. </p>
<p>Gerry, Lionel, Cheryl, and Kenny were there to pick me up at 8 p.m. Tea and tidbits at Tim Horton's, home to make a couple of phone calls, and off we went to bed at 11 p.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/a_relaxing_sunday_in_nfo.html">A Relaxing Sunday in NFO</a></h2>
								<p>What a lovely day this was! Gerry made what has become our traditional Sunday breakfast... perfect poached eggs, whole grain toast, and fresh tomatoes heated up to spoon over the toast... and a pot of tea. </p>
<p>I had a long leisurely chat with Candy, and rolled some of the fifty plus pounds of pennies of Uncle Frank's. </p>
<p>At 1 p.m. we left with a neighbour and good friend of Gerry's and Lionel's, Nancy, to attend a play at the Shaw Festival. We all very much enjoyed "Ah, Wilderness" by Eugene O'Neill. It was funny, touching, and very well acted; the tickets were only $10, as unsold seats are available to family and friends of the actors a day or two before it plays. Gerry knew the 12 year old boy in the play, so that made it even more interesting. I always forget how much I enjoy live theatre until I attend a play; I must do so more often. </p>
<p>It was a perfect fall day, crisp but sunny, and we drove past Tricia Romance's beautiful home in Niagara-on-theLake before heading home on the backroads through Virgil and past where Becky and Wayne lived. </p>
<p>The three of us were very hungry by this point so we had pizza at Boston Pizza for dinner, rented "Calendar Girls", came home, made a pot of tea, and just relaxed for the rest of the evening. I have seen the movie before so sat and rolled some more pennies, getting lots done. </p>
<p>My day ended with an unexpected and very pleasant phone call from Bryn!... the first time I have spoken with him since I left S.F. We caught up on some Riku/Amelia/apartment/job news, and now I'm off for another early night.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/glorious_autumn_day.html">Glorious Autumn Day</a></h2>
								<p>I have had the most amazing weather since arriving in Ontario and today was an example of a perfect fall day. It started off quite cool and was cool overnight, but by early afternoon the sun was hot and the day as sunny and gorgeous as could be. </p>
<p>I had some time with Beth in the morning; also saw Tammy and Elizabeth when they came to pick Beth up... computer problems needing attention. Drove to UF's and made fried egg sandwiches and a pot of tea for lunch. We had a very productive afternoon, clearing away boxes of craft materials, another of appliances, and a big box of gifts. </p>
<p>I left at 5:15 and drove to Ian's for a three hour visit. His new home is really lovely, comfortable and the tidiest and most well organized home I have ever been in. There is a wall of family photos, a well stocked bookcase, a place for everything and everything in its place. Mom would have been very proud of this son she raised. It was such a pleasure to sit there and catch up on all that has gone one since January; he filled me in on his final chemo sessions, he weighs more than he has since high school and he looks just wonderful. He made me a perfect cup of tea and had two slices of zucchini and walnut bread beside it for a snack for me. </p>
<p>From Ian's I drove to Sheldon's; Donna was upstairs in their room so we went down to the rec' room where Shel' showed me their new bathroom, complete with a steam/shower and a huge jet tub. What a great job the two of them have done renovating their home. We had a two hour visit, also catching up on our news with each other. It was fun exchanging grandchildren stories with him. It's not often I have a one-on-one visit with my number two brother, and I really enjoyed the time with him. </p>
<p>Home at Gerry's and Lionel's at 11:15... bed too late, but maybe tomorrow... <br />

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/last_night_in_niagara_falls_ag.html">Last Night in Niagara Falls... again!</a></h2>
								<p>This will be short and sweet as I am too tired to think straight. It was a very busy day, packed every minute with one more little job I wanted to get to... unpacked the car from last night, drove to WalMart to copy two photos of Uncle Harry, bought new jeans, more penny rollers, cards, then drove to Beth's to deliver goodies (which she was delighted with)and squeezed in two games of cards too!, and then had a relaxing lunch at "John's" with Uncle Frank. </p>
<p>Back at his house we emptied his big freezer, and then I puttered around doing a few easy little jobs... made up some of Auntie Rita's rhubarb, another of black currants she picked last summer, and left three dessert dishes of custard and fruit for UF to snack on while I'm gone and more to make up himself. It is such a pleasure to cook for Uncle Frank, especially when I know how much he enjoys these little extra treats. </p>
<p>At 5 p.m. we went to Ian's to drop off the frozen bits... met Lisa, who was charming and friendly, Ian showed Uncle Frank through his new abode, and then we met up with Vicki, Mitchel, and Alanna!, who (along with David, of course) are living just a few doors down from Ian while their new house is being completed. I took a photo of the children, so eventually it will be up in an album. They were very sweet and friendly, even though they don't know me from Adam. </p>
<p>Leaving there we drove to St. Catherines for a shared plate of eggplant parmigiana at "Lena Linguine's". UF liked it very much too!</p>
<p>Had a few minutes chatting with Gerry before she went off to bed... and now I plan to do the same thing, before (once again) it is midnight before my light goes out.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/back_to_toronto.html">Back to Toronto...</a></h2>
								<p>Caught the 11:15 a.m. bus back to Toronto this morning, after spending most of the morning sorting through all the bags, suitcases, etc. in my room, in preparation for leaving in a big hurry in another week and a bit. Oh, also bought some delicious tofu rolls from the Chinese restaurant opposite the bus terminal for my lunch on the bus; their food is delicious and I enjoyed every bite of it. </p>
<p>Once in Toronto, I stored my big bag in a locker and did some birthday shopping for Kelly downtown. Took the subway home in time to meet the children at 3:30 at school. Had some time to chat with Kelly, which was lovely, while the children played outside and/or practiced the piano. </p>
<p>After Bryant left with his mom (Myk' was at a friend's), Bryn and I caught the subway downtown for dinner at Movenpic... cheap date... pizza for him and a shared plate of rosti between us. </p>
<p>Quiet evening at home, watched a little t.v., did a bit of laundry, answered some emails, and read all of Akane's latest blog entries which I couldn't access from Gerry's. </p>
<p>Such a pleasure to see Riku's little face on the blogs. I'm missing both Riku and Amelia a lot this week. Three weeks is a long time away from those ever-changing little ones.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/off_to_las_vegas.html">Off to Las Vegas!</a></h2>
								<p>... Kelly and Gregg that is! They left at 6 a.m. today and just as Kelly predicted I didn't get back to sleep. That was fine though as I had my shower over with early and was all set when the children wakened. It was a busy day, filled with the usual walks to and from school (just Bryn and Caillie home for lunch), some time throwing the ball to Manitou to tire him out for his naps, and some general work around the house. </p>
<p>I did have a long chat with Vicki this morning and then a longer one with Gail tonight. Vicki will be with me tomorrow morning for a visit and Gail sounds just awful; that poor girl is in obvious pain and has been told to take sixteen Tylenols a day for pain. Surgery in three plus weeks which will be a very long time indeed with the pain she is having tonight. </p>
<p>Walked Caillie to piano, while Bryn was at his final soccer try-out; he made the school team! and we are all delighted for him. He plans to try out for badminton as well. No, Bryn Sr., I don't think they  have ping pong at the school. </p>
<p>Bryant and Myk' were here after school for a couple of hours; snacks, piano practice, and a trip to the piano teacher's house with Caillie, after which their mom picked them up. </p>
<p>I'm more than ready for bed tonight...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/off_to_bed.html">Off to Bed...</a></h2>
								<p>after a lovely, but very busy day. That seems to be the only kind there are here, and in the Falls too! As a result the time is flying by faster than I ever imagined it would; Bryn called this afternoon and reminded me that I would be home a week today! Hard to imagine! So much still to do, so little time! </p>
<p>Today was again unseasonably hot at 29C. Vicki arrived just a few minutes after I walked the children to school, and went with me to the alley while Manitou had his fifteen minute "catch the ball" session. It was nice and cool in the basement so we went down there to chat while I did the ironing and got the last load of washing in. </p>
<p>Bryn and Caillie hadn't seen Vicki for quite a long time, possibly two years, but she looked familiar to them and gave her big hugs when we met them at school at 11:30. We all had grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch, and then drove the children to school... we were off to pick up Cath's gorgeous mixed breed dog from her grooming session, did some shopping at a hardware store and dropped the dog off at Cath's and Mike's home in the city. </p>
<p>All four children came home with me, and we quickly organized Bryn and Bryant for their 4 p.m. pickup to Jacob's birthday party. The girls spent an hour or so playing dress-up and came down looking very glamourous and willing to pose for a photo. We had dinner at home instead of going out for pizza, and watched a movie... "Annie" that was in the house. I think we were all too hot to think about walking out again. </p>
<p>The boys came home at 8 p.m., watched the end of the movie with us, and off they all went to bed, a tired group, at 9 p.m. First however, I lined them up on the side of the tub and washed eight very dirty feet.... actually, six, as Myk's were amazingly clean, thanks to runners and socks on her feet all day. Caillie definetely won the dirty feet award tonight but Bryant came in a close second. </p>
<p>Kelly and Gregg called to talk to the children; they just loved, loved, loved "O", the big show in Las Vegas, but were wondering if they were going to find enough to do for the next two full days, not being gamblers. Maybe one trip to Las Vegas will be enough for them. </p>
<p>10:40 and I'm off to bed. Bryant and Bryn have requested an 8 a.m. wake-up call to clean their room! I think Bry' is the one who is super keen but Brynnie will happily cooperate.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2004/09/what_a_grand_day.html">What a Grand Day!</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke at 6:45 this morning and had my emails read and a shower before the boys woke up, a little earlier than their intended 8 a.m. awaking but not by much. True to their promises last night they got right to cleaning their room, which really meant sorting it out, (putting all the Lego pieces in the right container etc.), and doing a really wonderful job on it. This took a grand total of twenty-five minutes of steady work and I promised to do the vacuuming and dusting. </p>
<p>At 9 a.m. we all sat down for breakfast together and then went out on the deck to try to recreate the photo of the four of them last summer, with Manitou, who was just a pup. Well, he was much more co-operative last year, as this year we could not pursuade him to lie down in front of them. Last year he sat on Bry's lap, and this year he could have stretched out on all four of them. </p>
<p>I "interviewed" Bryant, our second annual attempt at this. I think it will be fun for all of us to see these interviews years from now. Unfortunately, my camera battery needed charging so Bry' was the one and only one done today. </p>
<p>Myk' and Bryant left with their mom at 10 a.m. and at noon Bryn, Caillie, and I were at Ontario Place. It was a perfect day for it, with 24C temps and some cloud cover. And what a fun day it was; it was the most relaxing day of my visit as we just "hung" out there, doing whatever struck the children's fancy (which included talking me into a log ride! Yikes!). I survived, much to my surprise, but it wasn't my favourite part of the day. Knowing that a forty foot drop is coming after that long climb up does not make me relax and enjoy it one bit. </p>
<p>We ordered a large cheese pizza for lunch, and all had soft drinks with it (they came with the pizza, so what could I do but sit back and enjoy it). We found a table with a big umbrella and ate while the children planned what rides they would go on next. </p>
<p>They enjoyed the big climbing gym several times and then we went on to play miniature golf, which Caillie is <em>so</em> good at! She had two holes in one during the first game and another during our second game. </p>
<p>Both of them loved the "driving school," complete with lights, stop signs, and lines on the roads, which many children completely ignored. As a result, there were a few three car collisions at intersections... lots of fun to watch.</p>
<p>The maze was great fun too; the children went through the first time on their own and then wanted to show it all to me too. It was just terrific and very well done.  </p>
<p>Disappointingly, we had saved the water slides and events until after the first golf game, just to find that they closed the water park down at 4:30! Bryn had really been looking forward to it but reconciled himself to another game of golf, and a cup of ice cream before heading for the shuttle to Union Station. Another surprise was the early closing at 6 p.m. as we thought it would be fun to see an IMAX movie, free with our tickets. However... </p>
<p>Manitou was very happy to see us, so while Bryn practiced the piano, Caillie and I took him out to the alley to chase a ball for twenty minutes, along with his friend Jake. </p>
<p>None of us was hungry so we ate lightly... yogurt, some sourdough toast, and a pear, while we watched "Flubber" with Robin Williams. It gave me a chance to finish up the mending while sitting and relaxing at the end of the day with the children. Bedtime at 10 p.m. for two happy  and relaxed children... and 11:30 for their Nana. </p>
<p>P.S. Kelly called just as we were coming in the door... 100F and steaming hot on the sidewalks.</p>
