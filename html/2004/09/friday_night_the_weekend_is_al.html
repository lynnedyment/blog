								<h2>Friday Night ... the Weekend is Almost Here!</h2>
								<p>Busy as usual morning... quick shower, and a brisk walk to school at 8:30 a.m. The boys stayed at school for lunch today so it was Kelly, Myk', Caillie, and I only; seemed very quiet. Back to school in enough time that Caillie had time to climb a couple of poles; so funny to see how keen she is... and so good at it too. </p>
<p>Kelly is making an album for Bryn's soccer coach and got started at it this afternoon. I went down and joined her, wrapping all the Christmas gifts I bought as well as Caillie's and Bryn's birthday gifts. Those days are always busy so it's great having this job done.</p>
<p>And the rest of the day flew by in a busy blur... Bryn's friend Sean had a practice after school, and since he was coming here with his brother Sam for a sleepover we all waited in the playground for him to finish... at almost 5 p.m! The rest of the children played with Manitou while we waited, and they were all very hungry when we finally arrived at home. </p>
<p>The children all ran around outside when we got home so I went upstairs for a half hour of quiet reading time. Kelly had gone dashing off to do some photo copying for the album, Gregg came home and worked on the project too, and Sandy, Corey, and Allie ran into busy Friday night traffic and arrived an hour later than they planned to... which worked out very well here, as we were running late too.</p>
<p>Gregg out together a great dinner of burritos/tacos with refried beans, guacomole, tomatoes, lettuce, ground beef, and sour cream. The evening had turned cool and somehow all twelve of us managed to gather around the table for dinner. Sandy had picked up a big jug of Ontario cider and two delicious pies... bumbleberry and strawberry rhubarb, which finished off our dinner very nicely! </p>
<p>Corey, Allie, Kelly, and I all hoped to play cards but it didn't happen; I did see Corey's album of her first year at University last year and since she leaves for Peterborough tomorrow there will be new photos up on ofoto soon I hope. </p>
<p>After dinner we watched part of the Riku/Amelia tape; the children, as well as Sandy, Corey, and Allie were just thrilled to bits to see Riku dancing and to see Amelia standing and going up the stairs. They can't wait to see Riku at Christmas and the children look forward to visiting with them both in the spring. </p>
<p>Bed at midnight after a quick cleanup in the kitchen... the children were awake until 10:30 p.m. !!! so no doubt we will have a tired crew tomorrow.</p>
