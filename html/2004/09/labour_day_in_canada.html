								<h2>Labour Day in Canada</h2>
								<p>I had a long relaxing morning at Gerry and Lionel's today. After a very light breakfast, in anticipation of a buffet lunch at the new casino, I helped Gerry enter some email addresses in her computer, wrote a few emails, and made a few phone calls. I was trying hard to get in touch with my brothers, to no avail, although I did reach Wendy. She and Glenn were on their way to London to take Steph's boyfriend to school; too bad as they could have joined Uncle Frank, Gerry, Lionel, their friend Doreen, Beth, Paul, and I for the brunch. We picked Uncle Frank up and were in line for brunch by noon hour. This was Uncle Frank's first visit to the new casino. </p>
<p>Lunch was great. There is a very large selection of food and it was very well done with plenty to choose from. I had a big plate of various salads and finished off with a big bowl of delicious strawberries, another of mixed fruit, and a very tiny slice of cherry pie. We took our time and left just two hours after arriving. </p>
<p>I drove out to Amy and Jake's for a long visit with Amy. Jake was off to Hamilton for the annual Labour Day football game between Hamilton and Toronto. Amy and I spent from 3 p.m. until 11 p.m. catching up on all our news and eating all the various and delicious food Amy had prepared... a tomato and boccocino salad, a big mixed vegetable salad, an eggplant, tomato, and onion casserole, followed by a small dish of vanilla ice cream, strawberries and chocolate sauce... and a big pot of tea. Such a very very relaxing day and evening this was. </p>
<p>On the way home I drove by Uncle Frank's to see if his lights were on. The office and rec' room lights were still lit and I was very tempted to drop in but... it <strong>was</strong> 11:15 so I drove on by. Just as well as he had found a nice big stack of photos he knew I would enjoy looking at, and I would have been there until 2 a.m.! He has promised to put them aside, smoking... as he put it, until I am back in town next week. I was happy to know it was safe to call him so late and able to say goodbye until next week; I am leaving for Toronto a day earlier than I planned. </p>
<p>Only one and a half more days until I see my Toronto grandchildren!</p>
