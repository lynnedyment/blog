								<h2>Happy Birthday Caillie</h2>
								<p>Caillie turned seven today; she had birthday pancakes and a Happy Birthday song to acknowledge her special day, before heading off to school. </p>
<p>Kelly and I drove the Bryn and Caillie to school, and then Gregg to work, where I had a tour of his lovely office; Daniel Lanois lives right across the street from this old renovated stable and then a residence, before being converted to an office building. Interior brick walls, large open spaces, and a deck make this one of the most appealing offices I have seen. </p>
<p>Kel' and I thought we would look for loot bag goodies in Chinatown but alas, nothing opened until 11 a.m., not even the bakery where we walked to buy tofu buns while waiting for the regular retail stores to open. Finally we managed to find some great containers for Bryn's party and bowls for the girls, as well as items to put in them. </p>
<p>Lunch at La Commensal was a real treat. I bought a huge plate of food and brought more than two thirds of it back home for extra meals. I have a hard time not choosing every vegie dish on the buffet table. </p>
<p>The dollar store was next where we finished the loot bags, then a quick trip to the grocery store for snacks for the party, and finally home. It was chilly today so at least we weren't rushing around and walking in the humidity of the last few days. </p>
<p>Myk' and Bry' were here with us until 5:30, and after piano practice there was time for Bry' to beat me in a game of "Guess Who" and another game which was new to me... can't recall the name now. I had hoped to have had dinner with Carol tonight but she wasn't able to make it, and Kelly and Gregg had dinner plans with friends as well, which were also cancelled. So, it was a quiet night at home for all of us; we watched some t.v., had some take-out food for dinner in front of the t.v. and I turned in after the two hour Oprah biography show. It was cold and I was happy to be in bed snuggled up reading.</p>
