								<h2>Another Day in Toronto</h2>
								<p>Caillie and I were wakened by Gregg at 7:30 a.m. today. We were both in a sound sleep, possibly lulled by the sound of the pounding rain outside our window. Gregg dropped the children at school at 8:30 so Kel' and I didn't have to face the downpour. </p>
<p>Vicki called this morning and we had a good long chat, mostly doula related, and caught up on some of our news. We plan to get together next week when she will be in town for a few days. </p>
<p>By noon the rain was just a drizzle; I made tuna sandwiches and tuna melts for lunch, with of course the usual big plate of carrots, celery, and cucumber, a standard at this house. </p>
<p>Bryn made a very sweet comment today; he said how happy he was that Auntie Susan and Amelia were part of our family still. We agreed with him, of course. The children are looking forward to seeing both Riku and Amelia when they visit San Francisco next year; they all seem to be as crazy about little ones as the rest of us. Must run in the family! Off to walk the children to school with just a light rain jacket on. </p>
<p>It was a pretty lazy afternoon for me and I was ready for it. I made a double recipe of Akane's favourite cranberry oatmeal cookies and then answered emails. By the time 3:30 rolled around there was no need for a jacket at all. The sun was out and shining brightly enough that Kelly and I regretted not bringing our glasses along. What crazy weather we had today! </p>
<p>Uncle Mark met up with us walking home; he had been at his parents for a week, so Caillie demonstrated her new pole climbing ability to him, and she showed me how she can hang from UM's one arm! I dashed out with the video camera and the digital camera to record Caillie's very impressive skills.</p>
<p>All the children played outside and ran off some energy after school. It was Caillie's turn to throw the ball to Manitou for ten minutes, although she was out in the back lane for more than twenty minutes. Uncle Mark was with her and I think the time just flew by for her. </p>
<p>She and I went off at 5 p.m. to have dinner out alone together at Il Fornello. It was a perfectly wonderful dinner; Caillie ordered and ate all of her margherita pizza and cranberry juice, as well as half of the Italian bread, and I had a most delicious wild mushroom and arugula salad with the bread that Caillie didn't finish. I had to be quick though! </p>
<p>Caillie did her piano practice while I answered emails upstairs, and then, after helping her with her shower and shampoo session, I had a long chat with Carol Woods, who called at the perfect time. We are hoping to get together on Saturday. </p>
<p>A little msn'ing with Bryn finished off my day; I'm heading up the stairs to bed. Time: 11 p.m.</p>
