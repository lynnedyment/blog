								<h2>Niagara Falls to Toronto</h2>
								<p>Kelly, looking long and lean and as healthy as can be (she was at the gym at 6:30 this morning), arrived to pick me up this morning at 10:50. I was ready to leave for Toronto about twenty minutes later, just as it started to drizzle a bit. Off we went to Beth's to deliver some clothes Kelly had brought for Alysa and Elizabeth. Stopped at Costco and bought some birthday and Christmas! gifts. How wonderful to have a head start at these; I plan to do the wrapping while I'm here. December won't be quite so rushed and my bags not quite so heavy. </p>
<p>Home about 2 p.m. to fix up a sandwich and chat a bit while putting away all the Costco groceries and hiding the gifts downstairs. </p>
<p>At 3:30 we were waiting at the school for the children to finish their first day of the new school year. They are late going back this year and the boys weren't convinced it was delayed as much as it should have been! Summer just wasn't long enough for either of them. However, both Mykayla and Caillie are thrilled to be back. </p>
<p>Bryant spotted us as soon as he was out the door, and came over with that shy smile of his. His hair is long and shaggy right now; he is looking very handsome and more like his dad to me. He doesn't mind a bit that his hair is now longer than his sister's. </p>
<p>Caillie came bursting out with big hugs for her Mom and finally spotted me; I was then the lucky recipient of so many of her sweet big hugs and was told  several times that she really really missed me. Caillie is long and lean, just like her Mom, and is as lovely as always. </p>
<p>Mykayla joined our group as well, and looks just fantastic with her new short hairdo; it really suits her and she has some bright burgandy highlights in it, which really suits her. Myk' looks like her Mom too and her Mom is a very pretty woman. </p>
<p>Brynnie was so sweet, and after giving me a nice big hug, told me I still smelled the very same; he has always been so aware of scents and I know this is important to him. Brookie always said the same thing. Must be that Keri lotion! Bryn is wider through the chest and was looking pretty cool in his black baggy pants, hanging down and dragging on the ground just a tad... the way they were supposed to do, I was informed.</p>
<p>Bryn and Caillie are with their dad until tomorrow at noon, and so off we went with Manitou, Myk', and Bryant. While Kelly picked up Gregg, we played a game of Sorry; it is fun to be back and just hanging out with them again. It does seem a long time since we have been together. We chatted about ghosts, and what things we will do in San Francisco next year, and of course Riku and Amelia. </p>
<p>I caught up on emails while Gregg made dinner. How wonderful is that?! We ate outside and I enjoyed every single bite of my pasta with freshly made pesto, a cob of Ontario corn, and a delicious barbecued portobello mushroom. Yummy indeed! What a treat to be <em>called</em> to the dinner table, and not be doing the calling. </p>
<p>Myk' and I had just enough time for a game of Aces before she went up to bed and then I sat and emailed madly. I may even get caught up before leaving here on Sunday. Kelly and Gregg were watching tv beside me, and we chatted during commercials catching up on more of our news. </p>
<p>Off I go to bed... looking forward to getting into bed earlier than usual the past few nights and perhaps finishing off my book.</p>
