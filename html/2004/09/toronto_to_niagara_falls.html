								<h2>Toronto to Niagara Falls</h2>
								<p>Awake at 7 a.m. Caillie still sleeping so I crept downstairs and hit the shower first. Quickly packed up my very full bag for the trip to the Falls; Bryn and Bry' had donated some toys for Riku and Caillie had a few things from her room as well, so the bag was heavier than i thought it would be on the return trip. Luckily, Gregg was driving to work so, just as I was heading out the door at 8:30 with the children, Gregg offered to drive me to the bus terminal. I was awfully glad not to be lugging the bag downtown during the morning rush hour. </p>
<p>Lionel, my old stand-by, was at the terminal in the Falls to pick me up at 11:20 a.m., and dropped me off at Beth's. I was famished and had an egg, toast, and tea before we played Aces and Double Sixes. What a perfect way to start my day. I left at 1:40 p.m. to walk to Uncle Frank's; there was no answer but he knew I would be over so I decided to head out. Arrived at 2:20, just as Uncle Frank came in from having lunch. </p>
<p>The first hour we just chatted in the bedroom whilst going over hand-written family notes from Auntie Rita; once again tried to find another piece of the ongoing puzzle that is the Lee family. There were photos to look at and a few things to decide on and then we got down to business... going through the attic space and clearing it out. Uncle Frank insisted on going up the ladder and remarked that it was 200F degrees up there! Despite this, he hauled down carefully packed-away evening dresses, Christmas wrap, old Samsonite suitcases and various travelling bags and lots of dust! This was a great job to have finished though, and we were both so pleased. </p>
<p>We called it quits for the day, stopped for a cold drink and some sliced peaches and blueberries, and chatted for a bit, before I headed off to walk to Gerry and Lionel's and Uncle Frank went to By' and Josie's for dinner. </p>
<p>I had left a message for Gerry saying I would be "home" for dinner but they didn't get it and were out with friends, so I had four very quiet hours on my own... made a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich for my dinner, looked through every one of the summer photos of Gerry and Lionel's visit with the seven grandchildren from Calgary, did some emailing, and chatted on the phone with Candy and Marie. </p>
<p>Went off to bed very early, which was a treat, after catching up on our day with Gerry and Lionel. Lights out at 10:45.</p>
