								<h2>Glorious Autumn Day</h2>
								<p>I have had the most amazing weather since arriving in Ontario and today was an example of a perfect fall day. It started off quite cool and was cool overnight, but by early afternoon the sun was hot and the day as sunny and gorgeous as could be. </p>
<p>I had some time with Beth in the morning; also saw Tammy and Elizabeth when they came to pick Beth up... computer problems needing attention. Drove to UF's and made fried egg sandwiches and a pot of tea for lunch. We had a very productive afternoon, clearing away boxes of craft materials, another of appliances, and a big box of gifts. </p>
<p>I left at 5:15 and drove to Ian's for a three hour visit. His new home is really lovely, comfortable and the tidiest and most well organized home I have ever been in. There is a wall of family photos, a well stocked bookcase, a place for everything and everything in its place. Mom would have been very proud of this son she raised. It was such a pleasure to sit there and catch up on all that has gone one since January; he filled me in on his final chemo sessions, he weighs more than he has since high school and he looks just wonderful. He made me a perfect cup of tea and had two slices of zucchini and walnut bread beside it for a snack for me. </p>
<p>From Ian's I drove to Sheldon's; Donna was upstairs in their room so we went down to the rec' room where Shel' showed me their new bathroom, complete with a steam/shower and a huge jet tub. What a great job the two of them have done renovating their home. We had a two hour visit, also catching up on our news with each other. It was fun exchanging grandchildren stories with him. It's not often I have a one-on-one visit with my number two brother, and I really enjoyed the time with him. </p>
<p>Home at Gerry's and Lionel's at 11:15... bed too late, but maybe tomorrow... <br />
