								<h2>Amelia, Amelia!</h2>
								<p>Susan had kindly sent me several photos of Amelia while I was in B.C., but nothing is quite the same as that little face lighting up when she sees me at the door. Doug was busy on the computer so off I went for a long walk with "my girl". I needed the walk; I wanted to see Amelia, and cleverly arranged for her parents to go to a movie so that I had some time with her alone at home, out of the stroller.</p>
<p>It was quite a cool foggy day on this side of town today, which was fine, as I walked briskly past Stow Lake and so enjoyed it. Amelia was tired and, despite being out for over two hours, slept for just one of them. Those little eyes really fight closing.</p>
<p>Back at her home, she was a joy and a delight despite the too-short nap, and we had a great time together. She stood for the longest time at the back of the sofa, holding on and looking out the window, and moving back and forth. At one point Amelia decided she wanted down and had her head hanging over the front of the sofa. As I have done with Brynnie, Caillie, and Riku, I turned her around and let her slide slowly down. The look of astonishment on her face as I clapped and said "hooray!" was too cute for words, and so we did it over and over and over again. How I wish I had had a camera with me for the look on Susan's face when she saw what her daughter had learned while she was gone!</p>
<p>We looked at and read some books, spun a ball around, and played happily on the floor until Susan and Kevin arrived home. What a lovely few hours this was and as if that weren't enough (and it was!), I also left bearing enough delicious Chinese take-out food for Doug and me for two very generous-sized meals but a <strong>large</strong> takeout container of tiny black jelly beans! ... all mine, as Doug doesn't care for them!</p>
