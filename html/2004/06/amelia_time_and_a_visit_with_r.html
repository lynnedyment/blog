								<h2>Amelia Time and a Visit with Riku</h2>
								<p>This morning our guest, Charles, arrived from Australia; he was with us for two days and they flew by. It was the first time I had met him and after Doug picked him up from his 10 a.m. flight we sat in the living room chatting for a couple of hours. Charles is a real people person and tells some great stories. Gotta love that Australian accent... </p>
<p>Then the day got busy! Susan and Kevin came by to drop some things off in storage while I held Amelia and had a bit of a visit with Susan. Meanwhile, my friend Maxine came by to pick up a few items for a garage sale, met Susan, Kevin, and Amelia for the first time, and introduced Amelia to her dog, Anya. Amelia was totally fascinated, leaning way over my arm to get a better look at Anya on the sidewalk below us; she is obviously her mother's child! </p>
<p>Doug and Charles went off to pick up some groceries and movie tickets for me, so Amelia and I snuck off for a nice long stroller ride thorugh the Mission District... not our usual long one, but enough for a fifty-five minute snooze for Amelia and a quick hello at Riku's house. </p>
<p>Riku may remember when Amelia pulled his hair three months ago so he didn't get too close to her, but she gave Akane a big smile in the kitchen, and them moved on to the living room to charm Uncle Bryn. They were both wearing stripes that day, and so made a very attractive couple; he "flew" her up in the air and down again, and she leaned against his legs, beaming her big smile his way, once again winning his heart. </p>
<p>I had started dinner in the late morning, but that was as far as it got, so Doug suggested dinner out (what a welcome idea that was!) and off we went to Marnee Thai for a most delicious dinner. It has been years since we have been there and it is as good as it always was; Charles liked it very much too and we were all ready for an early night when we got home.</p>
