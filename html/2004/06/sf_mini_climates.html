								<h2>SF Mini Climates...</h2>
								<p>It was a beautiful warm sunny day in Potrero Hill this morning; I sat at the table with the back door wide open, the sun streaming in, and my shirt sleeves rolled up. I had a very productive day and completed my weekly ironing, as well as many phone calls, and a lot of boring paper work. </p>
<p>I needed a break and, with luck, Amelia needed a sleep so off I went to pick her up at 4 p.m. It was cool and very breezy over in that part of town; I had a jacket with me and needed it, although once I started walking briskly the temps mysteriously rose... funny how that happens. </p>
<p>Amelia was asleep within ten minutes of leaving her house (her Mom knew she was a tired girl, and she was right). I stopped at a little market on Haight Street and bought four pints of luscious looking organic strawberries for just $1.00 a pint! They were as good as they looked, as I just finished off a small bowl before sitting down to write this. </p>
<p>We were out for two hours and fifteen minutes and Amelia was asleep for all but fifteen of them! I'm always amazed at how happily she awakens... coming to the surface with a slow sweet smile and finally bursting into big smiles, lots of hand action and topping it off with a big wet raspberry, complete with a big satisfied grin for me. What a darling she is! </p>
<p>It was a fast walk through the park, with a slow stroll through the rose garden and then a meander around Stow Lake once again, where I was lucky enough to spot a heron sitting on a low branch overhanging the lake, with many ducks huddled against the high wind in that section of the park. By the time we were on our way home the sun was shining again and the wind had died down.</p>
<p>Before leaving Amelia today I watched her eat a very hardy and large portion of strained carrots followed by apricots with applesauce. This is a gal who likes to eat; the proof is in her cheeks!  </p>
<p>Potrero Hill was still sunny and warm when I pulled up at 7 p.m. after tea and biscuits with Susan and Kevin. A message from Bryn was waiting for me, saying that he and Riku were coming over for a little visit, to return a trolley to me for my laundry room. </p>
<p>Riku was smiling away at me from the back seat of the car when they pulled in and was very happy to have a little time to play up in my bedroom, with his blocks and, of course, his friend the mirror. </p>
<p>How lucky I am to have that little family just around a few corners from me! As I carried him down to the car, we spotted a huge flock of birds overhead which obviously thrilled him to bits... a bonus before leaving Nana's. How clever I was to have arranged the timing so well. </p>
<p>Bed time... night night.</p>
