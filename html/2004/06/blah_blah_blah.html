								<h2>Blah Blah Blah</h2>
								<p>Riku is learning new things every day and today was a red letter day, with three "awww moments". </p>
<p>I was speaking on the phone with my friend Tay, and finished off a sentence by saying "blah, blah, blah"... Riku looked up at me and said "blah, blah, blah" and after hearing me laugh out loud continued to say "blah, blah, blah" for another two or three minutes whenever I walked by him. </p>
<p>Today Riku called out to me for the very first time; I was in the kitchen and he was wandering in the hallway and his room (or so I thought). Then I heard "Nana?", then a pause, another "Nana?' and another pause followed by a third one. I looked around the corner and there he sat on the fourth stair up, waiting to be given permission to continue up to our bedroom... which of course we did. </p>
<p>As usual, while we were sitting at the table we were flipping through magazines looking for something interesting. Riku has been quite fascinated with some pics of women athletes from the weekend magazine and stopped at one showing a swimmer's back. I told him that was her back, and then patted his and said "Riku's back" and then pulled up my shirt to show him my back. A few minutes later I asked him where his back was and he shrugged sideways with his head cocked over his shoulder to indicate that he did indeed now know where his back was! </p>
<p>I finished off my day by taking Amelia out for a stroller ride/sleep while her parents did some unpacking. She showed her absolute pleasure by blowing some wonderfully loud raspberries at me, accompanied by lots of liquid bubbles as well; it's our favourite thing to do right now and makes me laugh each time.</p>
