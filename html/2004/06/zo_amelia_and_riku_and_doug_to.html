								<h2>Zo&euml;, Amelia, and Riku ... and Doug too</h2>
								<p>Today Gail and Glenn celebrated their fifty-seventh birthday! Candy, Beth, and I all sang "Happy Birthday" to Gail on paltalk this morning, one at a time, but alas, Glenn missed out as he didn't join us today. </p>
<p>It was a bonus day today with a phone call from dear Zo&euml; in England. It has been far too long since our last phone call, and both of us have been neglecting email correspondence, due to our very hectic and busy social lives! We talked on her dime for a good while and then I called her back to continue catching up on all our news. What a perfect way to end the week. </p>
<p>I had my weekly chat with Bryn and Caillie  as well today. Bryn is sounding very grown up to me; I think his voice is deeper. He is a very good conversationalist and told me that the photo album, organized by Kelly as an end-of-the-year gift for his very special teacher, with accompanying letters and a photo of each pupil in the class, was a bit hit.  </p>
<p>Caillie sounds as chirpy and chipper as ever; Caillie doesn't like to spend much time on the phone, but is polite and answers a few questions before suggesting that I talk to someone else! However, she does like to be the last one on the phone; recently we have started counting backwards from a number which she chooses, ending with "I love you" and hanging up. </p>
<p>Amelia and I had a very nice long walk in the sunshine today... two and a half hours from 4:45 on. Before we left the house though she showed me how she can pull herself up to a standing position; she is as steady as can be and Susan tells me she can stand there for a good twenty minutes or so. As I was walking her the last ten minutes of our trip, I wiggled my fingers at her which made her smile and then reach out to touch my hand. We continued doing this for the rest of the trip home. I would reach out, grasp her hand and let go... and then she would reach out giving me the biggest smile when I interlinked our fingers. What a doll she is! </p>
<p>Susan sent me home with take-out Chinese food from our favourite vegetarian spot in Berkeley... a wonderful tofu and vegie dish and lemon "chicken"... yum! I didn't realize how hungry I was until I started heating it up! What a thoughtful and perfect thing to do, and that too was a wonderful way to end my week. </p>
<p>Bryn called to see if I would like to come over to say goodnight to a certain little boy. I did indeed, and we played with blocks in the kitchen, emptied out the plastics drawer and then "ceaned up" which I sing to him as he does so. Riku is very good at cleaning up after himself; what a good habit to begin so early and he enjoys it too. </p>
<p>I helped him brush his teeth with the new toothbrush and children's toothpaste that I bought him a couple of days ago. Oh, does he enjoy that! I helped get him into his pajamas and then walked home, awaiting the phone call from Doug to pick him up from BART... home from the last of his classes for the summer possibly. </p>
<p>Riku will be a happy boy tomorrow to see "Bompa".</p>
