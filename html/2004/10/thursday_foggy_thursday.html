								<h2>Thursday, Foggy Thursday</h2>
								<p>Celeste and Steve left for their course at 7:45 a.m., and I had some PalTalk time with Gail, Candy, and Glenn, before heading upstairs to get started at the backload of ironing... twenty plus shirts! Arggh! </p>
<p>Doug had taped Oprah for me while I was away so I took the ironing board upstairs and settled in for a few hours of pressing time. Watching tv certainly makes ironing more pleasant for me and before I knew it I had only seven pieces to go to the end of the pile. However, I really needed a break and some air, and Amelia was ready for a nap. We do make a good team! </p>
<p>I had an adventure along the way though... a flat tire in the Mission District, so after a few phone calls and then a lucky turn with two good Samaritans, who changed the tire for me, I drove to Larkin tires, had it repaired and finally, at 5 p.m. managed to get to Fell Street. </p>
<p>Amelia was asleep before we hit the end of the Panhandle and slept for a full hour and a half walk through the park in the fog. It was really beautiful, and not chilly once I got up to speed. Susan had kindly made me a thermos of really hot tea, which hit the spot perfectly. </p>
<p>The light was so wonderful that I stopped and took a lot of photos... of two new hearts I hadn't photographed yet (but had intended to), of the lake with some trees in their fall colours surrounding it, and of course of Amelia, one of my favourite subjects. </p>
<p>When she awoke, we had a lovely half hour together with Amelia pointing to the trees, stretching up to see the dogs going by, and making her noise and mouth action for fish. I didn't see any, but Amelia may just be much more observant than I am. </p>
<p>I had promised Bryn some time in the apartment with him, so off I went to Hampshire Street at 7:30 p.m. First came dinner, and we walked around the corner to a little Mexican place which specializes in quesadillas; we each had plain quesadillas with black beans, served with small amounts of sour cream, salsa, and guacamole... just delicious! I will have it again soon, with Doug... a good plate to share if one isn't too hungry. </p>
<p>Back at the apartment, I sorted out a bookcase, and did a little dusting in anticipation of just four more days of waiting for Akane and Riku. There were some new books for Riku's shelves while Bryn organized the new shelves that he had installed in the storage room off the kitchen. </p>
<p>Somehow I managed to stay awake long enough to drive to Oakland to meet Doug coming in at 12:20 a.m. tomorrow!!! One tired woman crawled into bed tonight...</p>
