								<h2>Making Up for Yesterday...</h2>
								<p>Well, today was a much better day, as I saw both children! Bryn phoned this morning to invite me out for breakfast with them at "Jim's Restaurant", an old favourite of theirs. </p>
<p>I had had a lazy morning, writing emails, and chatting with all of the children in Toronto; Myk' was practicing the piano, and Caillie thought Bryn was in the shower, but eventually I spoke with them all.</p>
<p>Caillie had just completed a fairy puzzle she had received for her birthday and they were getting ready to go off to the dog park with Manitou. After speaking with Bryn, I scooted upstairs and managed to shower, wipe down the shower stall, make the bed, plus make Riku some hot cereal with berries, cut up a little pear for him, and make him one cup of fresh orange juice before Bryn and Riku picked me up twenty-five minutes later. Whew!</p>
<p>Breakfast really hit the spot... two fried eggs, over medium-well (there), really good hash browns which Riku shared, whole wheat toast and tea. Yum! I could have eaten twice the potatoes... a rare treat. </p>
<p>Riku is such a sociable little boy. A family came in and sat at the booth behind us, and Riku spent almost all the rest of our time there observing every little thing the two children did. He is very open and unembarrassed about being such a voyeur! </p>
<p>We all walked over to a book store on Valencia with Riku calling out letters on signs on the two block walk. I pointed out the gas markings on the sidewalk today, so now he knows there are letters down as well as up. What an exciting world it is!</p>
<p>Riku was just adorable in the book store. He chose a book and then went on to sit in three different seats while looking around and observing people. At one point, a fellow sitting in a chair smiled at Riku as he walked by, so of course Riku smiled back, engaged him in conversation, gesturing to all the books, waving his arms around in animation and totally enchanting the man. It was really something to witness as he is quite a charmer. </p>
<p>Riku was ready for a nap by the time we were in the car on the way home, so I headed home for some emails and Bryn went off to work. At 2 p.m. Bryn suggested that a walk with Amelia would make lots of folks happy... Amelia, who always is up for a walk, Susan, who could use a little time on her own, and Kevin, whom Bryn had planned to work with this afternoon. I was missing Amelia; it seemed a long time since Thursday, and I was over at Ashbury Street at 2:45. </p>
<p>Kevin brought Amelia to the door, in his arms, and Amelia immediately stretched out her arms to me, and gave me the biggest hug I have ever had from a child so young. Both arms and a long hug too... so sweet; no wonder she has stolen my heart! She looked just adorable too, in  a black top with black pants decorated with big white cow spots. </p>
<p>Susan had mentioned a street fair on Cole Street; a few blocks later we were there, with Amelia getting her full share of dog-watching. This little girl is just mad about dogs and doesn't miss one of them.  We wandered for a bit, and the food smelled wonderful, so I ended up buying, and eating, two absolutely wonderful samosas. Amelia had a snack too and then we off for our usual walk in Golden Gate Park. Just ten minutes later Amelia was asleep. The park is very quiet on Sundays, as they close it off to vehicular traffic... no cars, noisy motorcyles, and this is just what Amelia needs for a good nap. I strolled around Stow Lake twice again today, as it was obvious this wasn't going to be a one hour nap today. </p>
<p>We were gone for almost three hours in total, I said goodbyes to all , and dashed off at 6:25 to pick up Riku and Akane for a trip to Rainbow Grocers. Riku knows by now just where the cheese is, and headed straight for his free sample, then said "olive?" and headed off for those. Today's flavour wasn't a favourite... cumin, so I got to eat all but one bite of his. </p>
<p>I carried Riku up the stairs, he said "Bye Nana" and off I went. I will be spending the day with him tomorrow so decided I should finish the Sunday newspaper, watch a couple more taped shows, eat something... fruit bowl, two slices of toast, and tea, and now it's bed time... past midnight tonight. Too late.</p>
