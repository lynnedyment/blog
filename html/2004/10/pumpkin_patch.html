								<h2>Pumpkin Patch</h2>
								<p>Well, today was an exciting day, with first visits ever to a pumpkin patch for both Riku and Amelia. Susan (in a bright orange top and black pants, dressed perfectly for the occasion) and I drove to Half Moon Bay in the morning, in separate vehicles, to guarantee that both children would be sure to nap on the way there. They did. </p>
<p>Susan chose a patch for us with some rides (pony, train, and hay) and with lots of pumpkins scattered about in various guises... scary goblins, skeletons, families, etc. and both children showed some interest in those. Riku was particularly taken with blow-up plastic airplanes, totally unrelated to the theme! Amelia was ever so anxious and willing to pat the ponies, but Riku wanted to look but not touch. When I asked him if he would like to go on the pony ride (he was too little really) he should his head solemnly and said "noooo". </p>
<p>Amelia was walking ever so capably around the not-so-even grounds and kept her Mommy busy. It is still a thrill to see this little girl walking! </p>
<p>We all went on the train ride and Riku would have been quite happy to go on again; instead we went on a hay ride, with only the four of us in the wagon. Amelia just wanted to stand up, which was forbidden, so Riku and Amelia sat and piled the hay up around them. Perhaps next year they will enjoy this particular ride more. </p>
<p>The children had lunch close enough that they could watch the ponies walking around in circles with older children riding them, and Riku spotted the "Goodnight Moon" decorations around the ring. </p>
<p>We decided to head off for another pumpkin patch to buy our pumpkins; this worked out very well as just down the road were hundreds and hundreds of pumpkins neatly lined up in the fields, with wheelbarrows and lots of time and freedom to choose them, in a far less crowded area.</p>
<p>Riku just loved this part of the trip; he was free to wander on his own and wander he did... over to another family and way out in all three directions, checking back now and them to make sure I was checking on him. </p>
<p>Meanwhile Amelia was getting her tan pants, and her shoes, very dirty by clambering in, on, and around the pumpkins having a great ol' time. She drummed on some nice fat pumpkins and had such fun. We each picked out two pumpkins and I bought a tiny one for Riku which he held on the way home. Susan and I both took lots of photos so eventually there will be an online photo album available! </p>
<p>We gave them snacks in the cars before leaving for home; Susan had some cheddar "bunnies" with her and Riku thought they were just delicious and good for "hopping" along the edge of his car seat too. They ate so much sitting there... fresh fruit, dried fruit, crackers, toast and Riku had some cereal too. I was hoping he would nap for the trip home, but no such luck... he had only twenty minutes, the last half of the trip, and was obviously still tired. I tried getting him into bed but he decided after twenty minutes of cuddling that that was enough, so off we went in the stroller for at least some quiet "down" time for an hour. </p>
<p>Oh, Riku said "Amelia" very clearly today and was so pleased when I repeated it back to him. He nods solemnly when he knows you have understood him.</p>
<p>We came back home with enough time for Riku to play with his cars, then in the garden with his water and containers. At 5:30 I managed to convince him to leave his toys and come for a car ride to Costco with his Mommy. We picked Akane up and spent didn't spend long picking up the few things we needed. </p>
<p>Back at home, Riku and I read lots of books and played with his blocks while Akane prepared dinner. Bryn came home and joined us at the table. It was very tasty and we all enjoyed it; Riku was ready for bed, so Bryn and I got him into a new pair of very cute two piece pj's, I brushed his teeth, read two books and left him in his room with his Mommy, ready to nurse.</p>
