								<h2>A Quiet  Saturday</h2>
								<p>I was awake early today and managed to get quite a few emails answered before dashing off to pick Doug up from the airport at 9:44 a.m. He has been in Florida and had less than an hour at home to pack up again for a trip to Warsaw, via London. Even though his plane was a bit late, and the bags slow coming into the baggage claim area we were home by 10:20. Doug was very efficient, as he had done a lot of prep work before leaving on Tuesday, and even managed to clear up a couple of computer problems on his machine for me (mine broke last week and there is a new Dell waiting to be hooked up next week). </p>
<p>Will be waiting to hear how Doug's first trip to Poland goes for him! He has tomorrow free to wander about and then teaches the next two days. </p>
<p>I ran a couple of errands on the way home, and then spent the rest of the day sitting in front of the computer dating and rearranging photos in online albums. Not a very exciting day, but a productive one for sure. It was raining heavily at some points, which made staying in more attractive than it normally would have.  </p>
<p>I took a break, made some tea, put together a fruit bowl and went upstairs to watch a couple of taped shows. I had enough energy to spend a few more hours on the photos and was very pleased with all that I accomplished today... there is not one photo left undated on the kitchen counter or the dining room table. Whew! </p>
<p>I phoned Akane thinking that if Bryn were working late, and not going home for dinner, that we could have some pasta together here, but Brent phoned with an offer of homemade chicken pot pie for them ensuring that Bryn did indeed get home for dinner. </p>
<p>No Riku, no Amelia... how very odd.</p>
