								<h2>Wednesday with Riku...</h2>
								<p>Ah, what a pleasure it is to know that Riku is once more just around the corner from me. He and Akane are still adjusting from the long trip, so I spent the morning keeping myself busy in the house (phoned Uncle Frank for a nice long chat) until I heard from Akane. </p>
<p>We were to have record-breaking heat temps today (not sure yet that we did) so I decided this would be the perfect day to stay home and stay cool. I picked him up at 1 p.m. (he had slept until 11 a.m. after being awake from 3 a.m. until 6 a.m.) and he headed straight out the door to the yard. I stripped him down to diapers and sandals and he played so happily with three containers of water, some cups, his big dump truck, and a snack table with grapes, Fig Newtons, and a container of water. </p>
<p>I brought him in for a diaper change at one point and he looked sleepy lying there, so off he went for a one hour nap at 3 p.m. Time for a long cool bath after that and he obviously enjoyed having all his familiar items, including his bath alphabet letters, in the tub with him. We washed "Robin's" hair and then his, and he stayed in the water until his fingertips were wrinkled. </p>
<p>Riku's ability to understand and repeats words immediately has really improved. Tonight in the bathroom he pointed to the magazine rack and said "books"; I told him they were magazines and he instantly said it back to me and repeated it again. Wow! </p>
<p>Off he went upstairs to rediscover and play with old toys and the new ones from Bryn and Bry'. Riku really loves playing with a tiny jewellery box that contains a broken string of pearls and some clip-on earrings. He puts everything carefully back when he is finished with them and these get played with while he sits on the bed. He stayed up there on his own for a bit (he had just started doing this before he left for Japan) while I organized dinner for him. </p>
<p>When Akane arrived at 6 p.m. with his new car seat in the stroller, Riku was back outside playing with the water. He wasn't too happy to be dressed but his dad was out for dinner so he, Akane, and I went out too... Amici's for pizza, which was so good. Riku enjoyed walking along the wide sidewalk at night, looking at the big letters on signs and enjoying all the lights. </p>
<p>He ate a very good dinner, some pasta, a little pizza, applesauce, and a couple of tiny crusts from the pizza, and then promptly fell asleep on the way home, less than two minutes after the car started. Akane and I got him undressed, into a clean diaper, and he was nursing happily away when I left at 8:20. I am sure he is sound asleep in bed right now, and hope he sleeps through the night tonight.</p>
