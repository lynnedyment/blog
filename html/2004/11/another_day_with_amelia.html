								<h2>Another Day with Amelia</h2>
								<p>Gial, Beth, and I were on Skype this morning for a bit; I ironed three shirts while Beth filled me in on her visit with Akane, Bryn, and Riku over lunch at her house yesterday. Sounds like he had a fun couple of hours there, with toys and investigating the house! </p>
<p>Kelly phoned this morning; I said hello to Riku and caught up with what he has been doing to keep busy... playing the piano, saying "hi!" in a big voice to Manitou when he walks by him, walked the children to school today with his Dad and Auntie Kelly, and asked Kelly for breakfast... a first! Kelly says he loves going upstairs to play with the boys cars in their room. I know how much he loves company so must be in his glory. He also went to the ROM with his parents during the afternoon.</p>
<p>How lovely to have Amelia over here with me two days in a row! Susan dropped off a sleepy girl at 9:45 and we put her right into the stroller to continue the nap she just started in the car. Alas, that was enough to tide her over for a bit, and she just drifted in and out of sleep for the next hour and a half. I had decided to walk to Van Ness and Sutter instead of walking around the Mission once more. There was a lot of construction going on, noisy motorcycles, big trucks hauling big loads, which meant lots of noise from them, street cleaning machines, impatient drivers honking horns, and lots of people talking very loudly as they passed by, all of which managed to get Amelia's attention. Finally, at 11:30 Amelia fell into a deep sleep and dozed all the way back home; I walked slowly and she managed another hour and twenty minutes. </p>
<p>Amelia didn't have much of an appetite today, but her nose is very stuffy today and I can see why food wouldn't hold much interest for her. Despite that though she had a grand time playing with lots of toys that were new to her upstairs. She loves going up and down the stairs and exploring Riku's room, playing on the bed with the animals, and today would throw herself down onto the pillows, struggle to sit up, just to do it all over again. </p>
<p>Susan was here to pick her up at 3:15, arriving with a gorgeous bright orange bouquet of flowers, big enough to fill two vases! </p>
<p>Doug left an hour later for a dinner meeting in the East Bay; I went upstairs to watch a couple of Oprah taped shows whilst eating the mushroom and pesto pie... soooo good!, and enjoying a hot cup of tea.  This was enough to give me a second wind and I came downstairs and got busy cleaning out the fridge, making up a big bowl of fruit salad, some rice pudding for Doug, and cooking mushrooms to freeze for Riku's return next week. Managed to get lots done with my free evening! </p>
