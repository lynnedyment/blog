								<h2>SF Zoo with Amelia and Riku</h2>
								<p>What a perfectly wonderful day this was! At 9:30 a.m. Riku and I headed off to the zoo to meet up with Susan and Amelia. Riku was asleep about five minutes after we left the house, two cars clenched in his hands, and his one dog tucked beside his head in the car seat. Susan and I met at our designated spot in the parking lot, both with children sleeping soundly. Both woke up around 10:40 and off we went for a three-hour adventure. </p>
<p>First up was Amelia's favourite place... the petting zoo. Riku was a little nervous when he first spotted all the big sheep and many goats, with long horns, wandering about, but he soon got used to them and was bold enough to pat them as they came close to him. Amelia is an old hand at this and shows no fear at all. </p>
<p>Riku was quite fascinated with the salt lick in the barn and kept disappearing in there to have another look at it. Chickens meandered about, there were ducks and geese in the pond, and it was just like a storybook come to life. We were there for quite a long time and after a few tractor rides on wee tractors (or pushing them about), we decided it was lunch time. Susan recommended eating at a table outside by the flamingos which kept the children interested while they ate their lunches. </p>
<p>Next came a train ride, which is one of Riku's very favourite things in the world right now... that and tunnels, and we were lucky enough that a tunnel was part of our trip. The conductor even said "All Aboard!" which Riku now says frequently (since the Tildon train ride two weekends ago), never failing to make us smile. </p>
<p>We saw... two giraffes, monkeys, love birds, meerkats, a zebra, gorillas (my favourites), and an owl, Riku's very favourite. He was so happy running and walking up and down all the various pathways, but was willing to be guided along to the next spot on the trip. Riku often just squeals with delight as he runs along and we get lots of smiles directed at him when he does this. </p>
<p>Amelia has a little cold starting and was more than ready for a nap, so she and Susan left us after the gorillas. Riku wanted to "see owl?" again, so we headed off, stopping first at the carousel for a long ride on a horse; perhaps next time he will choose the cat with a fish in its mouth, as he spent a long time admiring it as he rode along. I don't think Riku stopped grinning the entire time he was on the ride. </p>
<p>There is a wide area of grass where birds of prey are out in the open; some of the birds have been injured and some were born in captivity, but the hawks and a few of the others are tethered to large poles. An owl was one of them and Riku was happy to stand and stare at him, as he turned his head around and around. Another plus was a guide standing with a snake wrapped around her hand. Riku was reluctant to touch it when she first suggested doing so, but soon decided he would go for it, and did! He touched it twice, with just two fingers, on the smooth soft topside of the snake, and then the even smoother underbelly. He was quite fascinated with its tiny tongue flicking in and out as well. </p>
<p>By the time we reached the parking lot Riku's eyes were droopy and he was asleep the instant I put him in the car seat. Ocean Beach was just too tempting to pass by, so I drove down a few blocks and parked the car where I had a wonderful view of crashing waves and blue skies. Riku napped for an hour and a half! and I read and dozed a bit myself in the warm sunshine. </p>
<p>We had enough time for a stroll on the beach, before heading for home, so stroll we did. It was just perfect as the sun was still warm but close to setting. Riku just wandered about on the hard packed sand near the edge of the water, picked up lots of sand, seashells, ocean grasses, and inspected little pink claws lying about. We left for home just as the sun disappeared into the ocean, and Riku happily snacked on dried fruit on the way. Riku pointed out all the letters he could see from the back seat, all lit up in the dark and so easy for him to read. </p>
<p>Once we were home, I gave him a choice of either a bath or time upstairs and upstairs we went, much to my surprise. I heated some pasta with pesto and tomato for him, and took up a bowl of applesauce for dessert as well; I fed him while he sat on the bed, inspecting some of his favourite things... my tiny wooden heart-shaped jewelry box and one of his Grandpa's puzzle boxes, which holds a name tag (Riku now says "Doug Dyment" when he picks it up!) and chatted about the snake, and the owl, and the eagle carving in my room, which he likes as much as the stitches wall hanging of an owl that Kelly made for me many many years ago. </p>
<p>He now knows that "Auntie Kelly" made that; we have been practicing the names of all the people he is going to see next week. How I will miss him for those nine days away! Thank goodness Amelia is not going away for the Thanksgiving holdiay; her big smiles and hugs are irresistable too.</p>
<p>Early bedtime for me tonight, as Riku will be here with me in the morning...</p>
