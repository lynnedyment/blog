								<h2>She's a Dancing Queen</h2>
								<p>Today was laundry day and after a few minutes of Skying with my sisters, I put in the second load of clothes and awaited the call from Susan, telling me they are on their way over. At 10:10 we started off on our walk and Amelia was sleeping soundly by 10:20 a.m. I walked out to the far end of Mission Street before heading back towards our end, picking up some bananas, and walking to Rainbow for butter. Amelia is managing lately to not respond to every loud noise by waking up, which is good, as the streets are not as quiet as the park! </p>
<p>On the way home, Amelia sat up nice and tall in the stroller, pointing out almost every tree we passed. She likes me to let her know each time and yes, indeed, that one too is a tree. I stopped in for some Russian piroshki; they were huge, and I bought only six of them, instead of the dozen I ordered, plus a very large mushroom and pesto turnover which could easily feed two people. </p>
<p>Amelia was ready for lunch and ate all the quiche and sweet potato her mom had packed for her, plus home made applesauce, and polishing off a couple of dozen pinto and black beans from my leftover burrito! Her cold is hanging in there, and I was surprised she ate as much as she did. Amelia took great delight in throwing books and magazines off the table when she had finished looking at them, and then saying "uh oh!" and looking down at them, as though it had been a big accident. Adorable. </p>
<p>After lunch was playtime and Amelia was happy to explore. Every time I went in the laundry room she found a new toy to play with... the popping pusher, the buzzing bee pusher, the press-on spinner thingie, and the penguin. Amelia used to be quite nervous of the penguin; it is loud and moves in erratic fashion but today she seemed to enjoy it, although at one point was walking backwards very successfully away from it, when it seemed to be gaining on her! </p>
<p>I put Raffi on for her to listen to and as soon as she realized music was playing started moving her body around and around, turning in circles, and "dancing" until the song ended. It was the cutest thing, and Doug and I just watched her until she stopped. </p>
<p>Once in a while throughout the afternoon, she would approach Doug making it clear that he was to pick her up, and so he did. Then she would point things out to him keeping him interested in holding her just a little longer. So funny to see this going on! </p>
<p>Susan picked Amelia up at 2:45; Doug and I left at 3 p.m. for a movie at Stonestown, "Enduring Love". I had "earned" a free popcorn with my ticket, so was a happy camper sitting there munching away on a small bag of my favourite movie treat. I was tired going into the movie and in fact had drifted off while reading in the car before going into the theatre. However, I stayed awake for the movie (it was a bit creepy so no doubt that was part of it) and enjoyed just relaxing in the middle of the day. </p>
<p>Doug and I went right home, he worked on some photos for my blogs, and  I caught up on more emails while he watched a taped show. I would have fallen asleep anyway as it was on from 10-11 and I am tired... night night!</p>
