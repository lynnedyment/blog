								<h2>One Week from Today...</h2>
								<p>is Christmas! Hard to believe! Another busy day but Kelly wrote to tell me yesterday that she has a massage booked for me, a birthday gift from her and Gregg, on Wednesday morning at 10 a.m. Ahhhh, I'll be more than ready for Ara... </p>
<p>Bryn had called last night to see if we would like to join him, Akane, Riku, Susan, Kevin, and Amelia for breakfast today at "The Pork Store", a very popular breakfast spot in the Haight district. I woke up at 7 a.m., hopped right into the shower, in order to be ready to leave at 8:10.. however, the phone rang, with a message from Bryn saying we were now meeting as close to 8 a.m. as possible, which meant leaving asap! Doug had a fast shower and off we went to pick up Bryn and family. </p>
<p>Breakfast was lots of fun; we had a big table at the front of the quiet restaurant when we walked in, but a half hour later it was full and noisy. The usual fare for the adults... eggs, toast, hash browns, tea for Akane and me, while Riku nibbled at my potatoes, toast, and some cereal and rice pudding that I had taken along with me. </p>
<p>After breakfast we snapped some photos of all of us and a kind woman offered to take a group shot too; Bryn walked Amelia for a bit while Kevin and Riku had a little stroll together. Riku took great delight in a very funny and huge pair of legs, made of... we're not sure...  sticking out of a window across the street from the restaurant. His grin and laughter were contagious and soon we were all seeing it through a two year old's eyes; it is a very funny thing to see! </p>
<p>Next on the list was a trip to Japantown, but alas, we had such an early start to our day that the stores weren't open yet. Rainbow, our local "health food" grocery store was open though with cheese and olive samples of which Riku and Grandpa are particularly fond!... so we strolled around there for a bit. Riku has so much fun wandering up and down the aisles, taking things off shelves, looking at them, and then putting them back exactly where he found them. </p>
<p>Back home alone, Doug did some computer work while I set about wrapping a few gifts, finishing off the birthday cards for January, and finally writing the last four Christmas cards which were waiting for addresses. Doug went out to buy fuel for the fondue pot, and I set the table, prepared the hot food, changed into a clean blouse, and was relaxed and ready at 3:30 when Akane, Riku, and Bryn walked in. Soon Susan, Kevin, and Amelia joined us, and an hour later Tay and Mike as well. Doug made the fondue, which was a big hit, Susan brewed up some delicious mulled wine, and we all relaxed, chatted, and enjoyed the afternoon. Amelia was quite taken with the fire going, but was amazingly good at realizing it was hot and staying away from it... while still being quite fascinated with it. Such a smart little girl she is! </p>
<p>Riku had a hard time sharing his Nana and toys with Amelia today, but this will get easier as they have more time together in the New Year. He had asked for a bath earlier and as soon as everyone had left I ran a deep tub for him and we had a half hour of time together in the steamy warm bathroom. Riku had quite the time in that tub tonight, splashing and kicking his feet, holding them under the faucet for ages, and giggling away. I think he was quite relieved to have me all to himself again! </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn tidied up for me while I was bathing Riku, and then we had a little time together before they left for home. They all sat at the table while Riku and his Dad drew... Riku asks for "color pencils" when he wants to draw; Bryn drew a Canadian flag, showed it to Riku, who promptly answered "Canada". </p>
<p>Riku also showed his daddy how he can cross his fingers (he learned this yesterday in the car on the way back from the visit to Santa) and adds that to his skill from last week of crossing his arms (and looking mighty proud while doing so), and interlacing his fingers, the skill from the week before. What fun all of this is to see!</p>
<p>Off to bed... just two more sleeps!  </p>
