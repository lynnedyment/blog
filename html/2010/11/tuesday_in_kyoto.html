								<h2>Tuesday in Kyoto</h2>
								<p>Riku slept in late this morning. I was lying waiting for him to join me, but gave up at 6:30 and went off to take my shower. I heard a sad Riku calling to me through the door that he had wanted to snuggle. So, fully dressed, I did so, and then suggested we take my computer to the table for him to play one of the TVOkids games while I prepared his fruit. </p>
<p>Mirei was still sleeping and then enjoying some "relaxing" time in her mom and dad's tatami room. Akane was upstairs with her, so Riku had some time on his own with the game after all  (although he would <strong>much</strong> rather play with someone else).  Maybe tomorrow. </p>
<p>As usual, we did the spelling lists over breakfast and then I read "Tuesday" to them, a story about flying frogs, which they both enjoyed and had lots of comments to make about what was happening on each page. </p>
<p>It was cold in the house again this morning, colder than usual, and Riku and I both wore our gloves on the walk to school too.</p>
<p>I walked fast today and cut off for home one bridge earlier than usual. I was really hungry and looking forward to my egg and toast, followed by a very hot cup of tea.</p>
<p>My thirty minute walk was as pleasant as always; the leaves are falling so quickly now and I stopped to take a photo or two of the few remaining trees still in full colour along the river. </p>
<p>After breakfast I did the dishes up as I always do, and was just fnishing up when Akane walked in from taking Mirei to school. It is sunny out and getting warmer so she got two loads of laundry hung up before leaving to run an errand. </p>
<p>Riku told me this morning that he had a "short" day today, and asked if I would meet him at school after 1:30. I met him on the main sidewalk on the other side of the bridge and even though he was walking with two other boys, he took my hand and walked with me. I heard all about his "kind of scary dream", about frozen caterpillars and dead slugs, but after telling me about it in great detail he decided it was "interesting, not so scary". </p>
<p>We stopped at the playground for ten minutes or so, just long enough for Riku to eat a few of the treats he had decided on at the nearby corner store, and climbed the square iron climbing structure. The topic of conversation the rest of the way home was a current favourite "in one of my rooms in heaven I will have ... " and both children come up with some great themes! </p>
<p>Busy boy once he got home as it was his two-hour session today with one of the Chinese students at 3 P.M. , so he got his piano practicing out of the way, and his math homework too, before "Jimmy" arrived. All of the Chinese students that come here have English names too, so now I know all three. Jimmy was a surprise to Akane, as she always refers to him by his Chinese name.</p>
<p>I was at the French Immersion school at 3:50 to pick up Mirei and, as has become a habit now, she and many other children want to spend "ten minutes!" running around the courtyard, screaming, chasing each other, and gathering together on a little doorstep before running off again. Lots of energy there! We now walk with two of the other moms and their children to the main intersection, and one of them gets the #9 bus with us. Today the bus was not nearly as crowded as usual, so the girls got to sit close to each other, with Mirei sharing her orange, pistachios, and a cheese  stick, much to the delight of the friend's eight-year-old brother. </p>
<p>Riku had a tough time during the forty-five-minute session with Jimmy today. He was resisting doing any more "work!" and at one point came running upstairs crying. I stayed upstairs with Mirei who was practicing her piano while Akane came down to settle things. Ten minutes late, when we were finished, Riku was sitting with Jimmy playing video games on the iPhone, going fifteen minutes past the usual cut-off time. </p>
<p>Mirei had her tub while Akane finished preparing dinner, and we all ate a really yummy meal together. After their dessert of green tea ice cream on a stick, a big favourite right now,  Riku had his tub, finished the last of his regular homework with Akane beside him, I read to Mirei and Riku, and Akane went upstairs to read with Riku ... a nice calm ending to our day with the children.</p>
