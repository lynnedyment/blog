								<h2>How Things Change!</h2>
								<p>April 2009. Riku is attending a new school here in Kyoto and I arrived in time to walk him to school on his first full day. We held hands, kissed goodbye just before arriving at his new classroom, and greet his very friendly, warm principal who stands by the gate saying hello to each child. After school, I met Riku in the courtyard, walking home hand in hand listening to all his stories. </p>
<p>About ten days later, we were still walking to school together and looking forward to greeting some of the local neighbours: a friendly woman, with a big smile, who is often out washing her little courtyard at the same time each day, and a farmer and his wife who live close by as well. We looked for interesting bugs, counted the ladybugs on the plants near the farmer's field, and often sang too. There was lots to see and talk about, and I enjoyed saying good morning to the now-familiar faces at his school. </p>
<p>The first change came when Riku told me I didn't have to meet him at the school for the pick-up, but can wait for him at the crosswalk just before the bridge we cross to get to his school. It was fun watching him from across that river spotting me, giving me a big smile, and walking with the large group of new grade ones, their first year in public school here. We hold hands, sometimes stop at the playground on the way home, and enjoy our much shorter walk to the house. </p>
<p>Three weeks later, Riku was often walking home on his own. Once in a while I went out for a little fresh air and "happened" to bump into him close to home, but mostly I waited for him to come bursting in the door. It waw pretty exciting for him to be walking home by himself! </p>
<p>March 2010: About half way through this month-long visit, Riku says we can just say goodbye at the gate, just up the ramp, so we can kiss goodbye in private. I miss seeing the children skipping in the courtyard but there are lots of children to greet on the long pathway to the school, as well as along the sidewalk alongside the river. Kissing takes place only when there is no one to see us. </p>
<p>November 2010. Happily, I am still walking to school with Riku each day. I so enjoy getting out of the house so early: we leave at 8 A,M. or very close to it, and of course take great delight always in these quiet fifteen minutes with him, after a busy hour plus getting the children organized for their day. We are still greeting our neighbours, although Riku only sees the one woman when I am here, as he doesn't walk that way when he is on his own. And we are still holding hands, unless there is a large group of children behind us.</p>
<p>Riku tells me he is shy and often wants to walk more slowly, allowing the ones behind us to get in front, and then taking my hand again. From day one this trip though is the biggest change of all: no kisses! Well, almost none, as he and his dad have come up with a "secret" kiss: a series of quick hand-squeezes! It works for this boy who is the only one who has anyone ever walking to school with him. </p>
<p>After leaving him well before the gate now, I look back quite often and see Riku waving to me, all the way back up to the sidewalk, until he can no longer see me from the ramp to the playground area. </p>
<p>I have asked him several times if he would like to walk to school on his own, and he always says no, but I have a feeling this won't be the case next year.  :(  So, each and every day I enjoy every moment of this special time with Riku. He's growing up!</p>
