								<h2>My First Early Morning Visitor</h2>
								<p>Riku joined me in bed this morning, as I had promised last night that he could. He was as warm as could be and snuggled in next to me, with a pack of cards in his hand, to ask me as he flicked through two at a time to choose my favourite one, This wasn't as easy as one would guess, because if I chose the "wrong" one I would hear why the other was better, stronger, or better. I always chose my favourite based on colour anyway, picking out the card with the most silver, or turquoise, gold, or blues. I know it's best that Riku not know this, but it surprised me how often I made the right choice! </p>
<p>Mirei slept in later than Riku so we had just a few minutes together before it was time to get up and get on with our day. It's the usual routine: fruit bowls, then an egg or two, toast, juice, and vitamins, and sitting at the table encouraging food to go in the mouth. Bryn and Akane have this down pat so I slipped away, had my shower, and was ready to walk out the door with Riku at 8 A.M. </p>
<p>Mirei was a little sad that I wasn't going to go on the bus with her, but I promised I would pick her up after school instead. Big hugs and kisses at the door followed by a big wave and many "good-byes!" from the laundry room door at the side of the house.</p>
<p>I so enjoy the walk to school with Riku; it was lovely doing this again and how I like holding his hand as he chatters away happily to me all the way there, filling me on on all sorts of things going on in his life: a caterpillar that wiggled from one side to another when he touched it lightly with a stick, watching a boy on the bridge one day deliberately hurting a tadpole and feeling sad about that, looking forward to his birthday party with two friends, etc.</p>
<p>So many little comments come out that show me who this little boy is, but they follow too quickly, one after another, and I forget too many of them.  I'm happy to be here. </p>
