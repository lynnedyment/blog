								<h2>Sunday Lunch with Riku</h2>
								<p>Akane and Mirei went off to a movie late this morning, and Riku had a very pleasant young Chinese woman Jessica, playing/teaching and speaking to him in Chinese for two hours. </p>
<p>Riku and Mirei had both done their daily spelling list in English earlier, and I thought this might be a good idea for his Chinese sessions too. Just before she left, Riku happily chose ten words he would like to know in Chinese, and write as well, so the next time he sees her, they will work on that list for a bit.Jessica is one of three young university students he sees on quite a regular basis.</p>
<p>Riku is always ready for lunch right at noon, and today, as he did yesterday, asked for a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich, one of his Dad's favourites too. While he ate, at his suggestion, we made a to-do list for him, adding in the things he had already done (I do this too(!), just so he could check them off ... his piano practice, the Chinese session, and his English spelling list of thirty words, all done in no time at all. </p>
<p>Added to his list were two "fun" things ... playtime with Juka, a neighbourhood friend, and some playground time to check out the mud ball we made yesterday and left baking in the sun. Two more chores were added ... reading to me, and writing up his Sunday journal for school tomorrow, plus one more extra Riku decided on ... tidying up his room. Apparently he and Jessica got out a bag of toys that had been put away, and they need to go back where they were in storage. </p>
<p>I suggested we do one work chore, followed by one of the fun items, and another work item, and another fun break. During this time, Riku came up with a very good idea. Last night he had just finished reading "Akimbo and the Baboons" out loud to me, his second time reading of the book over a period of months, so suggested instead of getting right into the next one, that he read a book of his choice, and agreed that it wouldn't be super simple. </p>
<p>So, while he was nibbling on his veggies, he read a wonderful story that was new to me: "Amber Waiting", about a kindergarten child who is always waiting for her dad to pick her up from school. There were some new words in it ... satellite, secretary, corridor, but also wonderful illustrations to look at as well. It was a treat to curl up on the sofa to finish off the last half of it. </p>
<p>Between lunch and the reading, we had started to talk about body parts and what they are really for. We decided we could make a book together, with Riku doing the illustrations and me doing the writing. Here's a sample, but it is still a work in progress. "Cheeks are for kissing, not for pinching. Fingers are for touching, not for bending back. Noses are for smelling, not for picking. Hands are for holding, not for hurting. Feet are for walking, running, and jumping, not for kicking people. Bottoms are for BMs, not for gas" ... although it was agreed that gas is necessary but not in public. "Teeth are for chewing, not for biting. Ears are for listening, not for twisting." There were lots of giggles for other body parts as we went through all the various possibilities, and we agreed we would keep working on it. </p>
<p>Lunch is never dull or boring when dining with Riku. He ran off happily to play with Juka for the rest of the afternoon.</p>
