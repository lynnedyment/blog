								<h2>"In One of My Rooms in Heaven ..."</h2>
								<p>This phrase begins one of Riku and Mirei's favourite things to do right now. I'm not sure how it got started, but we first played it during the summer in San Francisco. We each take turns pretending we have a <strong>huge</strong> house in heaven (Mirei's is actually a castle), and we can choose whatever we like to fill one of them. </p>
<p>Riku's house (he calls it "our house" as we live together, along with lots of family members too) is four stories high. Good thing with all those people in it! Some samples from Riku: a game room filled with video games, a huge kitchen that always has all his favourite foods at the ready, a room with every drink you could ever want to have, mostly hot chocolate with marshmallows, and lots of juice, and tea for the grown-ups too. There will be a movie-watching room, with every movie one would ever want to see, and snacks at the back too, as much popcorn as we like. There will be a game room as well, with Lego, puzzles, and building toys. The list goes on and on ... </p>
<p>Mirei's rooms are very different; they contain one just for ribbons and bows for all the presents there, for her and for her friends too. They are mostly pink and purple bows and ribbons, but no yellow. Mirei is not a fan of yellow. There is a room filled with dolls, and doll clothes, and strollers, and cribs, and lots of pretend animals too. Mirei hasn't mentioned food or drinks yet, but I'm sure that will come in time. Mirei would like a big kitchen where she can make real pizza and snacks, just like the kitchen at the San Jose Discovery Museum but with real food and real ovens. </p>
<p>Mirei likes to talk about her plans on the bus, but occasionally when we are sitting at the table too. Then she and Riku and I take turns stating our wishes. Riku's descriptions are always very elaborate, though, and Mirei often gets impatient waiting for her turn to come around again. </p>
<p>Riku and I have a lot of time alone, so his plans are not just for the house, but for the grounds and surrounding area as well. I will have him draw a picture of it soon, before it gets busy and he forgets the details. </p>
<p>We will live in the country; he likes to live in this area he is in now, so there will be fields with vegetables and fruit, mountains behind the house, with a big city hidden behind them. There will be a river and a lake too, so we can "relax" by the water when it is hot, but it will never be too hot, because it is heaven. </p>
<p>Animals, even wild animals, will wander about, but no one will ever get hurt by one, and they won't hurt each other either. There will be cats and dogs too, with no claws or sharp teeth, so that Mirei is not afraid of them. I will not be allergic to cats. </p>
<p>There is so much more to tell ... we will have wings, of course, so that we can fly wherever we like and never get tired. </p>
<p>There will be no money in heaven except for smokers who will pay a fine if they smoke, but after twenty times they will go in between heaven and hell. (Riku doesn't want smoke to make heaven not smell good or make the air dirty.)</p>
<p>There are no bad guys or good guys; everyone is nice because that is why they are in heaven. Oh, and beautiful music always playing, but softly, so it doesn't bother anyone. Grandpa will have a big library with music and some tools too. </p>
<p>One of Riku's first suggestions was that in heaven we will see everyone we always loved. What a guy! </p>
<p>I shall make a list of more rooms as I think about them. It has been such fun having this continue on when we have those quiet moments to really think about what would make us happiest.</p>
