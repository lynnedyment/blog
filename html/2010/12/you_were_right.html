								<h2>"You Were Right!"</h2>
								<p>Those were the first words Riku spoke as he got off the bus that brought him back from his first swim class here in Kyoto. Swimming, or rather not swimming, has been a worry for Riku for a long time. When he first moved here in the spring of 2009 and found out he was going to have to swim at school, he fretted about it, and I know it has been in the back of his mind ever since. He did not enjoy the lessons he had at school, that year or this year.</p>
<p>He took private lessons in San Francisco that first summer, and was doing very well at overcoming his fear of putting his face in the water (and of being convinced that he just couldn't do it.). His cousin Bryn was like this as well, even after a number of years of lessons. Both of them didn't/don't want to attempt to do some things if they are not positive they will succeed. They somehow feel that it came easily to everyone but them.  </p>
<p>Those lessons ended with Riku being able to swim a bit, making him feel much better about himself. However, his last lesson was taken with a gal who broke his trust in her, promising she would not let go of him in the middle of the pool and then doing so. Arggggh! </p>
<p>Once more he was dreading the classes at his school, even months before they were going to happen. Soooooo ... </p>
<p>... today was the big day! His parents signed him up for lessons with a proper swimming school, so he would be in with children at his level ... not able to swim. Makes sense, as this puts him on an even keel, something that is so important to him. </p>
<p>He had brought up the upcoming lessons a number of times this past week or so, didn't seem terribly worried, but nonetheless they were obviously on his mind. We have chatted about them briefly over the week on the way to school. </p>
<p>This morning he told me he was a "still a little worried ". I reassured him that he would be in with other children who could not swim yet, that I was a teenager before I learned to swim, that even champion swimmers, such as his cousin, didn't learn to swim right away.</p>
<p>As we walked to the bus stop to meet the bus that would take him off for this big step, I told Riku that he should not worry about swimming, but just have fun in the water and to relax and enjoy it. </p>
<p>And then I had to wait two hours before walking back to the bus stop to get him... </p>
<p>What a big smile I saw when he stepped off that bus. He came out with that "You were right!" ... and all the way home I heard every detail of the session. </p>
<p>The male teacher is very nice, there are four children in his class, they had a warm shower first, then stepped into water that was at their knees, then up to their middles, and then up to their necks.They could hold on to the sides and stand on their tiptoes.</p>
<p>Early on, the teacher said he was going to pour water over their heads to get them used to water on their faces. Riku told me he kept his eyes closed the first time, forgetting that he had goggles on, but then he opened them and it was fun to see the water coming down over them. </p>
<p>They went under water at different levels with objects varying in size, and Riku was so proud that he put not just his face in the water, but even bent way down and  picked a marble up off the floor of the pool! </p>
<p>The only part Riku didn't like was when he opened his mouth a bit under the water and swallowed, but he is sure he won't do that again. </p>
<p>He is looking forward to next Saturday and I am one very happy Nana! He liked it, he really liked it! </p>
<p>p.s. His teacher called Akane in the evening to say that Riku had done very well, had had a great time, and wondered what Riku's reaction had been.  </p>
