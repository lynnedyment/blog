								<h2>Monday Musings</h2>
								<p>... on the way to school today, Riku reminded me to keep an eye out for "the BM on the BM sidewalk", one stretch of a block that seems to be a popular spot for "doggie doo". Almost every day he will tell me that "You almost stepped in some!" although I am actually very careful about watching where I walk. I think he's anticipating my reaction when and if that ever happens. He <strong>is</strong> seven years old, after all.</p>
<p>... While walking home from school this afternoon, Riku and I talked a little bit about the concert on Saturday. I asked him if he had been expecting Mirei and Haruka to go to the edge of the stage with flowers for him and his reply was "No, and they were <strong>so</strong> cute!" They certainly were. </p>
<p>... Riku and I were alone in the house after school today, but had a short "to-do" list from his dad, to be done before game time. Riku's great about just getting to it, though, so did his two sets of homework lickety-split, after his piano practice, which he insisted on doing before even having his snack. What a guy!</p>
<p>... Bryn took Riku off to his karate lesson at 4:45, leaving Miss Mirei and I to entertain ourselves. She sat snuggled in next to me, covered with a blanket, and read five new pages at the end of "Ten Apples up on Top". She doesn't want any help from me once I have told her the word once or twice. I pretended I was sick, Mirei fed me "medicine" ... yummy tiny dots of strawberry candy, and made me lots of delicious bits of "food" from her play kitchen, which we brought downstairs yesterday. </p>
<p>... Akane and Bryn made dinner together tonight and it was wonderful: Bryn made polenta for the second time and we all agree we could eat it regularly, while Akane cooked up a tasty melange of fresh mixed veggies and mushrooms to go along with it. </p>
<p>... We all watched some of a movie during and after dinner: "Kung Fu Panda". Lots of fun and it had Riku and Mirei laughing out loud. </p>
<p>... Akane and Bryn out for a late dinner once the children were tucked in. I was heading off for bed when they came in at 11 P.M. </p>
<p>... Doug was winging his way to England today; I thought of him throughout the day, as he had a very long wait in L.A. before his long flight to the U.K. He'll be settling in now for his first night there. </p>
<p>... lovely relaxed day for everyone.</p>
