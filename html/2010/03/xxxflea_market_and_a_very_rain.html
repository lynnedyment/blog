								<h2>Flea Market and Happy First Anniversary for Akane and Bryn</h2>
								<p>At 8:15 this morning we all left the house with Mirei to drop her off at school, and head on to the monthly flea market held on the grounds of a temple. We all stood waving to Mirei as she climbed up the few stairs to the building, but she was already doing her usual routine, greeting other students, and getting on with her day.</p>
<p>It was not a great day for this outing, as it was raining when we left the house and raining harder by the time we got there. The buses were crowded with tourists, more crowded than I have ever experienced here. The minute we hit the grounds, Riku smelled food cooking and asked if he could have oden, a mixture of foods (potatoes, carrots, daikon radish, sausage, fish cake, and shelled hard boiled eggs, all simmered together in a fish broth). Akane makes this at home, and it's one of Riku's favourite dinners. Bryn said it is also available at most corner stores, and is a popular take-out dish. He and Akane organized that for him, and we found a table under a big tent.</p>
<p>Bryn bought me a roasted ear of corn on a stick ... it would have been better if it had been hotter, although it is also traditionally served with soy sauce on it, and Bryn opted not to get that for me in case it wasn't my cup of tea. Hmm-m ... not sure. </p>
<p>We walked around checking out each of the many many booths, although Akane did say when the weather is better it is much more crowded, and with far more booths selling goods and foods. I was disappointed not to have had a chance to try the steamed potatoes that both Akane's father and sister enjoy so much, as it was one of the booths that chose not to be out in this inclement weather. Next time! </p>
<p>Riku was cold, even though I put my fleecy jacket under his rain coat, and he was bored too, so he and I caught two buses home, stopping in at a bakery near Mirei's school for a tiny pizza and a bun for him, and a crusty French roll for me. We nibbled discreetly away at them on the bus home, which was not crowded, and was toasty warm to boot. The buses are often too hot there but today it felt wonderful. </p>
<p>Home for hot chocolate and a snack, then we read the very last chapter in the baboon book. Bryn had promised that as soon as he had read the book to me twice, he would get him a much longed-for game called "Plants vs Zombies"! Within minutes after Bryn and Akane walked in the door, it was being downloaded to the iPod Riku uses. Happy boy! He has been reassuring me all week that it is not really a killing game, as they aren't people, but zombies, and zombies are not real, etc. etc. He knows I wouldn't want him even pretending to kill real people and is very sensitive to my feelings about it all. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn arrived home with the perfect sized (and priced) narrow short bench to hold Akane's purse, bags, etc. (made by a craftsman who uses no nails or screws, and makes the boxes that hold the instruments for the tea ceremonies, in temples). Another great find was a green enamel baking dish that Bryn and I had spotted at the same time, to be used to hold the three remotes in the living room. The final buys and bargains of the day were two more boxes: one, of burnished copper, they can use to hold a small vase of flowers, or the small collections of seeds and/or single flowers the children bring home (pictured below). The second box found a home in the corner of the kitchen counter, a spot Bryn has never been happy with. Now it holds the butter container, a glass jar of elastics and twist ties, the daily vitamins, and the candy jar, all gathered together in one unique wooden box. </p>
<p>Riku and I spent some time on the sofa while he demonstrated his new game to me; I even got to move the sun at one point to keep the zombies at bay. His little fiingers are far quicker than mine though!</p>
<p>When it was time for a break from the game, he wrote a card to a former classmate at Starr King, did his piano practice with Akane, and all told had a relaxing few hours before heading out with his dad at 4:45 for his karate class. </p>
<p>It seemed a long day without Mirei today as she had gone to the dentist after school with Akane. She apparently was not the least bit cooperative and although she didn't fuss at all, she flat out refused to open her mouth for him! So, no cleaning, no proper check up, and no snack on the way home, which did not make her happy. Poor wee girl ... life is tough. </p>
<p>I had made mac' and cheese for the children's dinner while they were out, and had it all ready for hungry Mirei to eat, along with saut√©ed spinach, and a mixture of carrot and kabocha squash, cooked together and mashed with butter. I sat with Mirei while she ate; she was a tired girl and I read some stories before she went off with a quick tub time with her mom. Early to bed tonight for her.</p>
<p>Riku came home from karate, a hungry boy, and polished off his big bowl of dinner in no time flat. Tuck-in time with him at 7:45. </p>
<p>I just could not get warm today; I sat with the heated up "bed buddy" on my lap when on the computer or reading on the sofa, and told Akane I had three layers on. She upped the ante, as she was wearing five! Brrrrrr! </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn went to a local bar just before 10 P.M.This gave me some time to work on  a contact from England via Ancestry ... one of my grandmother's maternal relatives. It's a relaxing way to end my day, and I was especially relaxed after the tall glass of Japanese potato "vodka" Bryn handed to me earlier in the evening, and a cup of warm sake before they went out. Yawn! </p>
<p>p.s. I haven't had my calendar out in a place that I see it, so I miss special days I am usually aware of at home. It was two days later before I realized that today had been Akane and Bryn's first anniversary. Bryn was happy they had spent some time at the flea market alone together, had a tasty lunch out alone, and come home with some very nice household items for their home ... even if they hadn't realized at the time that it was their anniversary gift to each other!</p>
