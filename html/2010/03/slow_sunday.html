								<h2>Rainy Lazy Day at Home</h2>
								<p>Today was a very lazy day for Bryn, Riku, and me, after the busy day yesterday. </p>
<p>Mirei had her French session start a half hour earlier than usual this morning, so she and Akane were out the door by 8 A.M., while the rest of us got to laze around the house. Riku played games on his dad's iPhone, watched a TV show, and got me to work on a few of the new balancing games on the iPhone. He's a patient teacher and congratulated me with encouraging words of praise when I was lucky enough to not sink the star in the "drink" in that one particular game.</p>
<p>I didn't even shower until 10 A.M. but once Bryn went off to a caf√© to work, Riku and I settled into a series of productive things that needed doing, with fifteen-minute breaks in between. He was great and willingly did his journal for yesterday, read a full chapter in the English language book he's working on, did his spelling list with Bryn, checked and packed his school bag for tomorrow, and wrote a thank-you note (complete with a drawing of him at his concert yesterday), to the Doering/Ellis crew. In between he was on the computer for a bit, up in his room playing on his own, or sitting beside me playing one game each on the iPhone. </p>
<p>Akane had spent some time with her parents and sister while Mirei was at her class, and then took Mirei to a birthday party for the little girl who was playing here with her last Saturday. Mirei was in high spirits when she got home, and she and Riku spent some time playing at the table with their little "bugs" from Susan. They both had a little homework to do; Riku wrote his journal page for today while Mirei lay on the floor on her tummy doing her "homework". </p>
<p>As soon as they were finished, the three of us went off for a walk in the rain, carrying our umbrellas, to pick up some milk at a big drug store just a few minutes walk away. I started singing "Singing in the Rain" to them, a big hit with them both, since we sang as much of it as I knew all the way home too. They were singing it in the house and Bryn played it for them at dinner; tomorrow I hope they can see a little video clip too, as I had told Riku about the tap dancing and Mirei about the splashing in puddles in the movie. </p>
<p>While Riku and I were reading in bed, Mirei came in and gave me six or seven big hugs and kisses, and finished off with a butterfly kiss. Off she went to bed with Akane, all glowing in her pink sleepers.  </p>
<p>Riku has caught Mirei's cough/cold and so had another early tuck-in, asleep again at 7:45.</p>
