								<h2>My Third Monday in Japan, Already!</h2>
								<p>It was a much milder day today walking Riku to school, so I'm hoping for more warm weather in the next two weeks of my stay. </p>
<p>Bryn invited me to have breakfast with him at a cafe I had spotted from my walk along the river last week. He has been there many times, and likes it a lot, so we met at the corner on our side of the river, and walked to this spot, only to find that it is closed the third Monday of the month! We'll go another day, and Bryn suggested a more modest, tinier spot further along and more "in town" than the first one. </p>
<p>I was just delighted with the whole experience. There is only one table, for four, on the right side as you enter. On the left side are five stools and a counter, and behind that counter was the friendliest woman, and a good cook too. </p>
<p>We had the "set breakfast", a staple in Japan (along with "set lunches" and "set dinners"). This means that they offer one specific dish at a set price, with no changes available. Bryn said in most cases, breakfast is a boiled egg, toast, a side dish of some kind, often a salad, and tea or coffee. However, this is the only spot he knows of that serves a fried egg with the meal. Eating eggs in restaurants is often a little tricky for me, as they are often served barely cooked, sometimes with the option of mixing into a hot mixture -- rice, broth, noodles, etc. -- to further cook it, but just the sight of that barely set white and uncooked yolk is enough to turn me off eating at all. He assured me the egg would be perfect here, and it was, exactly the way we cook them here at home. </p>
<p>Our breakfast was this perfectly fried egg, two thick slices of white toast, buttered (<strong>so</strong> good!), and a small bowl set on the plate with crisp fresh lettuce leaves, some other variety of finely chopped lettuce, and half of a tomato, all lightly tossed with a light vinaigrette, and a small dollop of mayo' on the side, which I mixed in. </p>
<p>Tea was served in a blue and white china cup, with the tiniest cream pitcher, only half filled with milk. I was so glad that Bryn didn't take milk in his coffee, as normally I would want about three times that amount in my tea. However, it turned out to be a thick cream, almost like whipping cream, so rich and thick that it was plenty for me. Yum! I'm sorry they don't serve their tea in pots here, as I would always like a second cup. </p>
<p>As we ate, four obvious "regulars" came in, all men, and all non-smokers, much to our surprise and appreciation! They all smiled and said good morning, chatting away to the owner. At one point she came to clear our dishes (and brought us a free cup of green tea too), and told Bryn she had seen me in the neighbourhood taking photos! And then one of the men stopped on his way out the door to let me know that he has seen me walking with Riku, indicating with his hand a smaller person. Such friendly people! I enjoyed it so much that I would like to go back there at least once more this trip. The cost of our meal was just over $10. </p>
<p>We went for a long walk in our neighbourhood, but further afield than I have been before. Bryn wanted to point out some of the larger homes in one area slightly above where he lives, where there is not the usual mix of very poor or modest homes right next to much more expensive homes. Many of these are old "farmhouses", but not anything like what we consider farmhouses at all. These are very large, often very elegant, with elaborate gates, lots of huge rocks, statuary, and on huge lots too. Beautiful. </p>
<p>Bryn also walked me by two shrines/garden areas I haven't been to yet, but which I shall do with Riku next week when he is off school. </p>
<p>Riku read another chapter in his current English book, "Akimbo and the Baboons", to me, Mirei read "Ten Apples up on Top", adding two new words to her reading vocabulary, and we had some free time together before Bryn took Riku off to his karate class at 4:45. I sat with Mirei while she had her dinner, popped her in the tub with lots of kitchen implements from her toy stove set, and enjoyed a quiet dinner with Riku and Bryn once Riku arrived home. </p>
<p>Did some reading this evening and headed for bed at 10 o'clock, after what has become a ritual lately, a nice glass of sake to finish off the day.</p>
