								<h2>Happy Birthday to Bryn!</h2>
								<p>It's Bryn's 42nd birthday today. All those years ago, Doug was in Calgary, my grandmother was in Ottawa with me, and at midnight she walked me to the cab, down a very icy driveway, when my labour started in earnest. From a doula's point of view, long after the event, I can see it was less than ideal ... I was on my own, no support from family, friends, or even a kind stranger, but was lucky in that I had a very fast easy labour and a beautiful baby boy was handed to me at 3:13 A.M. He had a very large head, a fine hint of reddish hair, blue eyes, and was a sleeper right from the beginning. His sister Kelly was waiting at home and learned early the next morning that she had a baby brother;  Doug met him two days later but Kelly had to wait until we got home six days later. How different birthing experiences are now... thank goodness!</p>
<p>... Bryn often opens a side door of the house to wave goodbye to Riku as we turn the corner on our way down the road; today he had Mirei in his arms, and they spotted a white cat on a roof across the street. As we passed by Riku said to me "That is a beautiful cat, isn't it Nana?" I agreed that it was and he said "It reminds me of Amelia because she has beautiful white hair too."</p>
<p> ... Riku was so pleased to see the farmer's wife today on our way to school. It has been so cold lately that she hasn't been out, but what warm greetings were exchanged today. This woman doesn't just say "good morning" to Riku, but always asks him a couple of questions or has something extra to say to him. Today I asked if I could take a photo of her with him; I was disappointed when she took off the wonderful cotton "pioneer-style" sunbonnet she wears and her heavy rubber apron, but did understand, as a woman, why she would do so. It's a lovely photo of the two of them, both beaming away and I'm so pleased to have it.</p>
<p>... Riku and I noticed snow up on the high hills off to the side of his school. The sun was shining brightly and it was warmer today than the past two days, so my guess is the snow may not be there for long. </p>
<p>... I went for a long walk after leaving Riku. I passed so many children on the way out of the school grounds again today, and I would say that 75% of them now greet me with "Good morning" in English. </p>
<p>... Bryn and I had a mini-celebration at a lovely little cafe while Riku was at his karate lesson. Bryn had told me about the yummy French bread, brushed with olive oil, grilled, and topped with warmed Camembert. Bryn's had either small bits of either grilled sardine or anchovy on top of his, and we both enjoyed large glasses of a delicious sake along with the sunakku (snack). We had ridden the bikes there, and I hit the right hand brake just a little too hard as I was drifting to a stop outside the cafe. I'm glad it happened before the sake, or that would have been blamed for it! </p>
<p>Back at home, Bryn taught Riku the general rules of Sudoku, and we were both amazed at how quickly and how well he picked it up; he was able to put in many numbers and obviously "got it"! He likes numbers though and does well at math so Bryn wasn't surprised that he did. </p>
<p>The evening with the children ended with Mirei trying to kiss her dad, while he pulled back, resisting and resisting... much to her delight, and determination too! </p>
