								<h2>Feeling Like a New Woman ... and Mirei Loves Me!</h2>
								<p>I awoke at 4 A.M. today, too warm, as I fell asleep wearing my clothes ... three layers on top, my slacks, socks, and Bryn's scarf. This was one of the very few times since I was a teenager that I have gone to sleep without doing my evening routine of washing my face, and flossing and brushing my teeth. Ugh! However, ignoring that at this point, I stripped off all but one layer, and went back to sleep until Riku woke at 6:20. </p>
<p>After my shower I felt, and looked, so much better; all those hours of sleep, ten of them, had put some colour in my cheeks and I wasn't cold still. Yahoo! Four days of that jet lag was enough, and the secret was finally getting more than four hours of sleep in a row. </p>
<p>Riku and I talked on the way to school about how many people we greet regularly on the walk to school. There is the our gal around the corner, and she was out again today, and we passed a friendly stranger whom we thought we might see again. Riku was disappointed that neither "his" man and woman were outside today, but we both agreed it would be fun if we could add some new people to our list. </p>
<p>Something triggered our memories about the song "Going on a Bear Hunt", which Kelly sang to Bryn and Caillie many years ago, and which I have sung to many children since. We made up some of our own scenarios ... a big snowstorm, a high wind, and sang all the way across the bridge and along the fields, now starting to be cleaned up and ready for planting.</p>
<p>Akane and Bryn had barium swallow tests today, part of a city-run program, so I had the house to myself all morning and for part of the afternoon. I made the most of it by finishing up my blog entries, answering a large number of emails, writing to Uncle Frank, and reading while eating my breakfast and lunch. I did up the dishes, got closer to finishing my book, and before I knew it Akane and Bryn were home. </p>
<p>Riku got out of school early today, at 1:45 instead of 2:40, so I set off to meet him, expecting to see him close to the bridge. No Riku in sight, so I walked on, walking almost all the way around the school to the courtyard, where I spotted him on his own, with his head down, totally immersed in his own thoughts. I decided to just continue walking on past him, as he hadn't spotted me approaching him; I was two steps past when it hit him that it was me. How he laughed, and ended up retelling the story to me three more times.  </p>
<p>As I was approaching the school, I had spotted three young girls and a boy all leaning over one of the shallow irrigation ditches, checking out something they had spotted. I thought it would make a great photo but they sensed that I was there, and all turned at the same time leaving me with a different photo than I intended.</p>
<p>Just a block from home, Riku and I were walking by a cabbage patch. Riku was so pleased as he had told me yesterday about discovering "some perfect cabbages, with no holes in them, and I wanted to show them to you when I saw them." I already had my camera in hand to take a shot of them. Riku knows me very well! </p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon and evening sped by in a flutter of activities. Riku did his piano practice with Akane, then had his snack and a bit of time to himself before his second Chinese tutor — Ma Lau-Shi (teacher Ma) — arrived at 3:30 for a two-hour session. I sat on the sofa, working on the computer and reading while the two interacted in Chinese. It surprised me to see that this fellow too has Riku sitting on his lap at the table while they did paper work ( writing and drawing), but it seems something that comes naturally to these particular fellows anyway. It's sweet to see. Riku had a few five-minute breaks and then they went back to the table; this teacher spends less time playing and chatting and more time actually teaching, using paper and pencil, and also watching Riku do some of his homework. </p>
<p>Mirei got home in time from her visit to the doctor (she has a cold and a cough, as of last Saturday) to spend a few minutes watching Riku play a game on Bryn's IPhone while watching with Ma Lau-Shi. She was happy and sunny, as usual. I asked her what the doctor said and her answer was "Nothing". She followed that by saying "to me. Just to Mommy and I don't know what he said." </p>
<p>I made dinner for the children tonight, since Akane was going to be home late with Mirei. I kept it simple and used one of the two packages of "mac and cheese" I brought with me from home. The children like it ... it's a whole-wheat version of a Kraft dinner with organic shells and white cheddar, and not something they have very often. I cooked up kabocha squash with sweet carrots, mashed them together with a little butter, and steamed broccoli. Both children enjoyed it, and I had the veggies with a bowl of brown rice Akane had cooked up for me this morning, along with some slivered ginger-tofu I had brought with me as well. </p>
<p>At dinner Mirei did a very interesting thing, giving all of us titles, our relationships to one another and designating us as female or male. Here is a summary of it all; it was quite astonishing. "There are five of us. Two are boys and three are girls. One is a mommy, one is a grandma, one is a brother, and one is a daddy. One is me. I am a sister. One is a Goda. Also Riku and Mirei are Goda but also Dyments. Daddy is a Dyment. Nana is a Dyment." </p>
<p>Mirei keeps herself busy, so often with little tiny notebooks, and pencils, again reminding me so much of Caillie. Today she wrote "I love you Nana" on one side of the paper, in pink ink, and asked me how to spell "from". A minute later she handed me the paper and on the back she had written "from Mirei" with kisses and hugs. It's a keeper, this wee bit of paper.</p>
<p>I bathed both the children while Akane made a potato cabbage dish for hers and Bryn's dinner, Riku had some music practice to do before bed, as well as reading a chapter in his English reading book, an interesting story about baboons that I had given him for Valentine's Day. There are lots of complicated words and I am amazed at how well Riku sounds them out. </p>
<p>We were busy right until the last minute before bed. Akane took Mirei upstairs, I snuggled in with Riku finishing off the "Captain Underpants" book which had him laughing out loud over dinner. He wants the whole series now, all ten of them still to go, I believe. They will be fun for him to have in SF this summer. </p>
<p>I didn't fall asleep tonight and wasn't even tempted to, but did have some time on Akane's computer, as she fell asleep with Mirei. I finished off my excellent book and went off to bed with "Travels With Charley", a John Steinbeck book I haven't read. I only brought three books with me, and am thankful that Bryn has some English books here I can read to fill in the gaps. </p>
<p>Bed at 10:30 tonight.</p>
