								<h2>A Walk Along the River and a Bike Ride Too!</h2>
								<p>The sun was shining beautifully this morning as Riku and I walked to school. The air was warm and, after saying goodbye to Riku, it seemed the perfect day to go for a walk along the river.</p>
<p>It's a lovely pathway, which goes on for miles; there are no bikes allowed, and there weren't many people out walking this early. I thoroughly enjoyed the quiet hour, and the long slow walk, not feeling the need to rush home and get warm! I stopped to take photos of the water, duck families, and a few of the egrets I spotted nesting or fishing in the low grassy areas just below me. </p>
<p>Akane took the train to Osaka this morning, leaving as soon as she dropped Mirei off at school. Lovely day for this trip. </p>
<p>About 12:30, Bryn suggested we got for lunch at a cafe up the river in the opposite direction I had taken this morning. Since it would have taken quite a long time to walk there, we set off on the bikes, me for the first time in perhaps eighteen years or so. I walked with the bike on the most narrow areas, not quite confident of my ability to not knock into someone walking or riding coming along in the opposite direction. I so enjoyed riding when the road was wide and clear!</p>
<p>Lunch was delicious and plentiful, a larger portion than is generally served in Japan. The dish Bryn had recommended I try is called a "Loco Moco", a dish of a fried egg, atop a hamburger patty of some kind (mine was vegetarian), and that atop a mound of rice. It is surrounded by a gravy, and on the side was mashed kobocha squash, one of my favourite vegetables here, with two crisply cooked very tasty green beans stuck in the top of the squash. Since it was more than I could eat, I had to leave some of it behind. No "doggie bags" in Japan (although Akane told me later that some places allow you to bring your own containers and take it home with you). I was sorry I wasn't able to save it for dinner that evening.  </p>
<p>Two extra bits... this cafe had one of the Japanese toilets I like so much; the seat was warm, and there were all the fun buttons to push that I remember from Sakai. </p>
<p>I noticed baskets sitting beside the tables in the cafe, and it was a very clever idea... to be used as a spot for purses, bags, etc. instead of having to put them on the floor. I did take a photo of this, but didn't include it in this entry. </p>
<p>Riku usually has his piano lesson right after school, but today it started an hour later. So, I got in my second walk to school today, and a little free time with Riku before he and Bryn went off on the bike. </p>
<p>Friday night is a night to relax here; no school the next morning, no rush to get homework done, etc. so the children watched a favourite tv show, and we all settled in for the weekend. </p>
<p>Big day for Riku tomorrow afternoon... his piano recital! We're all very excited about it, but Riku seems to be taking it all in stride. </p>
