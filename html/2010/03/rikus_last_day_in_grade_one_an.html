								<h2>Riku's Last Day in Grade One and Three Meals Out for Me</h2>
								<p>Bryn and I both walked Riku to school in the rain today, after deciding to have breakfast at the spot along the river that was closed last week. We were waiting outside the restaurant at 8:50 when the owner showed up; he opened the door five minutes early for us, and invited us into his very elegant, yet somehow rustic, dining rooms. </p>
<p>Bryn likes this spot very much and I can see why. There is lots of wood, all gleaming, china teacups hanging on a rack above the bar/serving area, china figurines in small alcoves set into the windows, with a warm homey atmosphere. I liked it immediately and settled into the comfy chairs for a lovely breakfast with Bryn. We had the "set breakfast" which included a boiled egg with our toast, a tasty salad of greens, and another cup of delicious tea with pure cream... that might be the secret! That, and always wanting <strong>more</strong>. </p>
<p>It was still pouring rain when I walked to meet Riku at noon hour, when school was dismissed for this year, and to my surprise Riku was well on his way home already. I am very happy I am going to have some free time with him before I leave for home next week. </p>
<p>Bryn suggested we go out for lunch, once again choosing a little neighbourhood spot that was closed the first time we tried to eat there. Riku was all for it, and since I knew there wasn't much on the menu for vegetarians, I suggested they go out on their own. They both nixed that, so off we went in the rain. Once again it was closed, but Bryn had another idea, a local spot a few blocks away. I was <strong>so</strong> happy I hadn't stayed home as I had one of the most delicious pasta dishes I have ever had... a very creamy sauce over perfectly cooked pasta, with asparagus and mushrooms. It could not have been better! </p>
<p>Riku was on his way to meet his Mom and Mirei for a movie, but asked if he could have cheesecake for dessert. Bryn suggested he wait and have popcorn, but after making it clear that cheesecake was what he really really wanted, I promised I would buy him dessert. How that boy enjoyed that "It's not-too-sweet Nana" cake. </p>
<p>He and Bryn played a bit of a game on Riku's iphone, and worked some "finger puzzles" too until our lunch was served. Bryn had shrimp, I believe, with his pasta and we all enjoyed our meal. Riku ate every bite of his cheesecake too. </p>
<p>I walked home after saying goodbye to them as they boarded the bus to meet up for the movie, and headed home for two hours, to warm up and go through some of the photos I had taken over the last few days. </p>
<p>At 6 P.M., after catching the bus downtown, I was waiting to meet up with the family at a sushi restaurant with the revolving food service. The children especially like to eat here, although Riku let Mirei take the dishes off tonight, so that I could sit between them. It's always a bit hard for me to see anyone eating raw fish, but I enjoyed sitting watching the stack of plates build up! Everyone ate well, and for surprisingly little money, I believe. I wasn't terribly hungry and so ate a small portion of tamago and the glazed sweet potatoes with black sesame seeds. Yum! </p>
<p>Bus ride home, quick bedtime routine, and this lovely day came to an end.  </p>
