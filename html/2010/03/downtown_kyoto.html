								<h2>Downtown Kyoto</h2>
								<p>Mirei and I have a funny little routine when we're walking to the bus; we pretend we are "rushing, rushing, rushing" and then we "relax" or "stroll", then we "hurry, hurry, hurry!" and then we slow down. Mostly Mirei likes to run fast though, so we do more of that than the strolling. </p>
<p>Today I accompanied her to school with Akane, as we had chosen today as the day for me to do a little wandering about in the big downtown centre here. There really isn't anything I wanted to buy, but I always enjoyed meandering around the food floor of the big department stores in Osaka, and it is fun to just poke around a bit. The bigger stores don't open until 10 A.M. so we went to one of Akane's favourite local chains for breakfast. I had a thick slice of white toast, a medium hard boiled egg, and tea, and Akane chose a breakfast sandwich. It was simple and delicious and hit the spot. </p>
<p>For the next three hours we went into two of the biggest department stores, a really great 105Y store, a place Kelly would have loved to have had access to during all the years she was putting together loot bags for Caillie's birthday parties. I could have spent a lot of time and money in there, but I restrained myself and bought only a few items, including a very small bowl and dish for Mirei. </p>
<p>The food floor at Takashimaya was disappointing compared to the branch in Osaka, but Akane was sure I would enjoy the one at Daimaru  and I did indeed. How I love wandering through all the different sections, which take up the entire basement floor of the huge stores. There are bakeries, with rows and rows of fabulous breads, rolls, pastries, cakes, desserts, etc. as well as a French bakery section with custards and tarts, fresh fruit cakes, and cookies. There is a massive area with prepared foods ready to go, and rows and rows of fresh vegetables and fruit (including a melon, a single melon, beautifully packaged and priced at 10,500Y, a little more than $110!) meat sections, pickles, tofu, etc., etc. Amazing! </p>
<p>On our way to two other stores, we walked through a huge shopping area, blocks long, filled with vendors selling everything from food to clothing. There were three young women dressed in kimono, and they happily posed for me when I asked permission to take their photo. At the end of our trip I bought two white t-shirts for myself, one a bargain at Uniqlo priced at 390Y and it is always fun to wander around in Muji too, where I bought three notebooks for family tree work. </p>
<p>Bryn had taken Riku to school today and picked him up. Mirei thought it was only fair that I took her to school today, as "fair" or "not fair" are operative words for her lately. </p>
<p>Mirei had to do her piano practice shortly after she got home from school, and she asked if I would go upstairs to listen to her. I said "Sure, I will bring my tea up with me," to which she replied "What about your camera?" So up I went with my tea and my camera and got my first video of her practicing the piano. We had time to watch a bit of "Mulan 2", a new DVD that Bryn just bought. </p>
<p>Riku was busy with Ma, one of his Chinese tutors, and then it was dinner time, homework, tub, and bedtime. </p>
<p>Another day flew by!</p>
