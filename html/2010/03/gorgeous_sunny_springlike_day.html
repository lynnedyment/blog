								<h2>Slow-Catching-Up Kind of Day ... Lovely!</h2>
								<p>Gorgeous sunny spring-like day today! </p>
<p>For the first time ever, Riku and I did not say "good morning" to one person on our walk to school. Such a disappointment after our resolve yesterday to try to find more "regulars". </p>
<p>Riku made an interesting observation this morning on our walk: he spotted a bright red car parked on the side of the road, and stopped to admire it, saying that "I never see red cars in Japan! Mostly they are white, or black, or grey." Sure enough, we looked around at three different parking areas and every single car was one of those three colours, except one beige one. A few blocks later we saw a blue car, and on my way home I saw a metallic blue, and a green car, but for the most part Riku was right. I'm sure this is not true in other areas of Japan, so perhaps this particular part of Kyoto is just a little more conservative. </p>
<p>Today we talked about kissing goodbye, and Riku suggested we run a little bit so we could do so as soon as we turned the corner heading up the ramp to the playground. It worked. This new routine makes me smile at how much has changed in the last year. Thank goodness holding hands is not considered embarrassing yet! </p>
<p>Mirei was cold when she got home from school, which is most unusual for her, and made us laugh by pulling Riku's one thick coat over her body ... she had stripped off her school uniform and was down to socks and underwear, and then pulled the sleeves of his other thick jacket up over the legs and feet. </p>
<p>I walked to the school, meeting Riku as he came off the bridge. He enjoyed his snack of cheese and "bacon" grilled on a piece of toast, as well as a fruit plate. This boy will always choose fruit over a regular dessert. He did his little bit of homework, still working on clocks and time, packed up the books he needed in his backpack for tomorrow, and settled in to watch a movie, a treat he was looking forward to on this day with no extra lessons. Bryn set aside his computer and sat on the floor with Riku watching the sci-fi movie, with lots of discussions as to what was happening.</p>
<p>Riku read me a chapter from his book, and for the first time read it by whole phrases, not just one word after another. He was very pleased with himself and how that sounded; I think it makes it easier for him to know what the story is too. </p>
<p>Akane made up a curry dish for dinner, and left for her class just before 6. While the children finished their dinners, Bryn played some music for them, starting with Abba, so that I could see both of them throw their arms out and sing "Knowing me, knowing you! ..." Hilarious. They both have lovely voices and enjoy singing so much.</p>
<p>Mirei decided she wanted to sleep with me tonight, and so Bryn tucked her into my bed at 7:30 and ended up staying there until I went to bed just after 11 o'clock. I tucked Riku in upstairs, promising to stay with him until he was asleep which took about seven minutes! I was downstairs at 7:50, and had the evening on my own.</p>
<p>p.s. I took a photo of the lovely silhouette of leaves on the window screen in my room.</p>
