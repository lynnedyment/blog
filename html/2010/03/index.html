								<h2><a href="/2010/03/monday_some_familiar_faces.html">Monday ... Some Familiar Faces</a></h2>
								<p>Riku's internal clock goes off about 6:30 most mornings; he's always the first one awake, and the first thing he does is turn on the switch in the living room for the heat. Fifteen or twenty minutes later, when Bryn comes down the living/dining room and kitchen have started to warm up. Riku now sits and watches part of a movie on his mom's computer until Bryn has his fruit bowl ready. Nice little pattern for him. </p>
<p>Walking Riku to school has always been a favourite part of my day, whether it was in San Francisco, or here in Kyoto. I was hoping when we left the house today that we would see some of the people we used to meet on this walk, and we lucked out immediately. The very friendly woman, who lives just around the first corner on the way to school, used to be out sweeping her little courtyard each morning, but today she was up on a tiny, second level balcony hanging her laundry. She must have recognized our voices, as she stepped up to the edge of the balcony to wish us a good morning. I was delighted to see her again. </p>
<p>Riku told me that he now says hello to two other people on his walk, and insisted we walk a different way than we used to so he could see them. Right on cue, another friendly woman, wearing one of those old-fashioned "prairie bonnets", stepped out from her house to say good morning as well. Riku told her I was his daddy's mother, and we bowed and smiled to each other. Apparently her husband is often with her, so Riku was a bit disappointed that I wouldn't meet him today too. Lots of days left for this though... </p>
<p>We held hands all the way to school, as we always did, and said good morning to the principal, another person I was looking forward to seeing again. I used to walk Riku into the school building itself, but today as we rounded the corner to go up a short ramp to the schoolground, Riku told me I could leave him there, and I learned later this is where Bryn leaves him now. Riku took a quick look around before he kissed me goodbye, something he wasn't shy about last spring. </p>
<p>On the way back to the house I passed a mom and her daughter who live just a block from here; we passed each other each school day when I was here in the spring and she greeted me with a very big smile and cheery "good morning" too. It's lovely being back! </p>
<p>Akane's etching press and a few other items that have been stored at a studio since last year were being delivered this morning, and Akane and Bryn were busy with that for a few hours. The press is extremely heavy and had to go up a flight of stairs; I sat answering emails while all of that was going on as it sounded dangerous and tricky, and I didn't want to witness any of it. It was cold with the door open and I was chilled to the bone. I can't seem to get warm here and hope that there is an early spring! </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn went out to run some errands in the early afternoon, so I had some time to write emails and do a little ancestry work. The time flew by though and I went off to meet Riku at 3:30 in a light drizzle. I took his brolly with me, and was greeted with his very happy smile when we met up before he reached the bridge. Back at home,  I made him up one of the snacks I used to make for him in SF... an egg and "bacon" sandwich on toast and a cup of hot chocolate, with apples on the side. </p>
<p>Riku had a little homework to do and did it in a jiffy... writing down what time it was for each of the dozen pictures of  clocks featured, and then we went upstairs while he did some piano practicing. I can't help him with it, but he's very happy to sit going through his books and playing the pieces he especially enjoys and some that he thinks I will especially like. I did some taping again, as I want to be able to see these once I am back at home. It's obvious that Riku so enjoys playing.                </p>
<p>Mirei came home with Bryn and Akane just after 4:30 and spent the next half hour spinning and dancing and cavorting about with just her sleeveless undershirt and her long socks! I was cold just looking at her, but her skin was as warm as could be. I took some video and pics of her, and that big happy smile of hers. What a delight this little girl is.</p>
<p>At one point, Akane showed her a cream puff she had bought for her for dessert, and Mirei immediately offered to share it with me. Bryn said he wanted half too, but Mirei pointed out to him that there wouldn't be enough, just for her and Nana. But, there was also a delicious pastry stick on hand too, and she offered to break her half in half so that Bryn could have a treat too. She's quick with her answers and Bryn and I often share a look at something she has come up with so fast and with such clear reasoning. </p>
<p>She and I put the last of the stickers in the "Angelina, Ballerina" book that we started on Saturday, and then Mirei read to me from "Ten Apples up on Top" once more. We read two more pages, with new words for her, and will practice again tomorrow.                              </p>
<p>Bryn took Riku off on the bike for his 5 P.M. karate lesson, and then picked him up again at 6:30. I had promised Riku I would wait and have dinner with him; Akane and Mirei eat earlier so that Mirei can get her tub time in and in bed at her usual time. It was the first time I saw Riku in his karate uniform and wearing his orange belt; I must say he looked very handsome. We sat at the table eating our late dinner, and looking at a book while we did so, not something that happens when we all eat together. </p>
<p>Riku was anxious to read as much of "Captain Underpants" as he could, and Mirei decided she wanted her mom to tuck her in tonight. Riku was very happy about that and at 8 P.M. we were under the covers and read two chapters of his book. </p>
<p>That was it for me for the night too, much to my surprise!  I dozed off, happily as warm as could be.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/xxx_a_new_woman_and_she_loves.html">Feeling Like a New Woman ... and Mirei Loves Me!</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke at 4 A.M. today, too warm, as I fell asleep wearing my clothes ... three layers on top, my slacks, socks, and Bryn's scarf. This was one of the very few times since I was a teenager that I have gone to sleep without doing my evening routine of washing my face, and flossing and brushing my teeth. Ugh! However, ignoring that at this point, I stripped off all but one layer, and went back to sleep until Riku woke at 6:20. </p>
<p>After my shower I felt, and looked, so much better; all those hours of sleep, ten of them, had put some colour in my cheeks and I wasn't cold still. Yahoo! Four days of that jet lag was enough, and the secret was finally getting more than four hours of sleep in a row. </p>
<p>Riku and I talked on the way to school about how many people we greet regularly on the walk to school. There is the our gal around the corner, and she was out again today, and we passed a friendly stranger whom we thought we might see again. Riku was disappointed that neither "his" man and woman were outside today, but we both agreed it would be fun if we could add some new people to our list. </p>
<p>Something triggered our memories about the song "Going on a Bear Hunt", which Kelly sang to Bryn and Caillie many years ago, and which I have sung to many children since. We made up some of our own scenarios ... a big snowstorm, a high wind, and sang all the way across the bridge and along the fields, now starting to be cleaned up and ready for planting.</p>
<p>Akane and Bryn had barium swallow tests today, part of a city-run program, so I had the house to myself all morning and for part of the afternoon. I made the most of it by finishing up my blog entries, answering a large number of emails, writing to Uncle Frank, and reading while eating my breakfast and lunch. I did up the dishes, got closer to finishing my book, and before I knew it Akane and Bryn were home. </p>
<p>Riku got out of school early today, at 1:45 instead of 2:40, so I set off to meet him, expecting to see him close to the bridge. No Riku in sight, so I walked on, walking almost all the way around the school to the courtyard, where I spotted him on his own, with his head down, totally immersed in his own thoughts. I decided to just continue walking on past him, as he hadn't spotted me approaching him; I was two steps past when it hit him that it was me. How he laughed, and ended up retelling the story to me three more times.  </p>
<p>As I was approaching the school, I had spotted three young girls and a boy all leaning over one of the shallow irrigation ditches, checking out something they had spotted. I thought it would make a great photo but they sensed that I was there, and all turned at the same time leaving me with a different photo than I intended.</p>
<p>Just a block from home, Riku and I were walking by a cabbage patch. Riku was so pleased as he had told me yesterday about discovering "some perfect cabbages, with no holes in them, and I wanted to show them to you when I saw them." I already had my camera in hand to take a shot of them. Riku knows me very well! </p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon and evening sped by in a flutter of activities. Riku did his piano practice with Akane, then had his snack and a bit of time to himself before his second Chinese tutor — Ma Lau-Shi (teacher Ma) — arrived at 3:30 for a two-hour session. I sat on the sofa, working on the computer and reading while the two interacted in Chinese. It surprised me to see that this fellow too has Riku sitting on his lap at the table while they did paper work ( writing and drawing), but it seems something that comes naturally to these particular fellows anyway. It's sweet to see. Riku had a few five-minute breaks and then they went back to the table; this teacher spends less time playing and chatting and more time actually teaching, using paper and pencil, and also watching Riku do some of his homework. </p>
<p>Mirei got home in time from her visit to the doctor (she has a cold and a cough, as of last Saturday) to spend a few minutes watching Riku play a game on Bryn's IPhone while watching with Ma Lau-Shi. She was happy and sunny, as usual. I asked her what the doctor said and her answer was "Nothing". She followed that by saying "to me. Just to Mommy and I don't know what he said." </p>
<p>I made dinner for the children tonight, since Akane was going to be home late with Mirei. I kept it simple and used one of the two packages of "mac and cheese" I brought with me from home. The children like it ... it's a whole-wheat version of a Kraft dinner with organic shells and white cheddar, and not something they have very often. I cooked up kabocha squash with sweet carrots, mashed them together with a little butter, and steamed broccoli. Both children enjoyed it, and I had the veggies with a bowl of brown rice Akane had cooked up for me this morning, along with some slivered ginger-tofu I had brought with me as well. </p>
<p>At dinner Mirei did a very interesting thing, giving all of us titles, our relationships to one another and designating us as female or male. Here is a summary of it all; it was quite astonishing. "There are five of us. Two are boys and three are girls. One is a mommy, one is a grandma, one is a brother, and one is a daddy. One is me. I am a sister. One is a Goda. Also Riku and Mirei are Goda but also Dyments. Daddy is a Dyment. Nana is a Dyment." </p>
<p>Mirei keeps herself busy, so often with little tiny notebooks, and pencils, again reminding me so much of Caillie. Today she wrote "I love you Nana" on one side of the paper, in pink ink, and asked me how to spell "from". A minute later she handed me the paper and on the back she had written "from Mirei" with kisses and hugs. It's a keeper, this wee bit of paper.</p>
<p>I bathed both the children while Akane made a potato cabbage dish for hers and Bryn's dinner, Riku had some music practice to do before bed, as well as reading a chapter in his English reading book, an interesting story about baboons that I had given him for Valentine's Day. There are lots of complicated words and I am amazed at how well Riku sounds them out. </p>
<p>We were busy right until the last minute before bed. Akane took Mirei upstairs, I snuggled in with Riku finishing off the "Captain Underpants" book which had him laughing out loud over dinner. He wants the whole series now, all ten of them still to go, I believe. They will be fun for him to have in SF this summer. </p>
<p>I didn't fall asleep tonight and wasn't even tempted to, but did have some time on Akane's computer, as she fell asleep with Mirei. I finished off my excellent book and went off to bed with "Travels With Charley", a John Steinbeck book I haven't read. I only brought three books with me, and am thankful that Bryn has some English books here I can read to fill in the gaps. </p>
<p>Bed at 10:30 tonight.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/gorgeous_sunny_springlike_day.html">Slow-Catching-Up Kind of Day ... Lovely!</a></h2>
								<p>Gorgeous sunny spring-like day today! </p>
<p>For the first time ever, Riku and I did not say "good morning" to one person on our walk to school. Such a disappointment after our resolve yesterday to try to find more "regulars". </p>
<p>Riku made an interesting observation this morning on our walk: he spotted a bright red car parked on the side of the road, and stopped to admire it, saying that "I never see red cars in Japan! Mostly they are white, or black, or grey." Sure enough, we looked around at three different parking areas and every single car was one of those three colours, except one beige one. A few blocks later we saw a blue car, and on my way home I saw a metallic blue, and a green car, but for the most part Riku was right. I'm sure this is not true in other areas of Japan, so perhaps this particular part of Kyoto is just a little more conservative. </p>
<p>Today we talked about kissing goodbye, and Riku suggested we run a little bit so we could do so as soon as we turned the corner heading up the ramp to the playground. It worked. This new routine makes me smile at how much has changed in the last year. Thank goodness holding hands is not considered embarrassing yet! </p>
<p>Mirei was cold when she got home from school, which is most unusual for her, and made us laugh by pulling Riku's one thick coat over her body ... she had stripped off her school uniform and was down to socks and underwear, and then pulled the sleeves of his other thick jacket up over the legs and feet. </p>
<p>I walked to the school, meeting Riku as he came off the bridge. He enjoyed his snack of cheese and "bacon" grilled on a piece of toast, as well as a fruit plate. This boy will always choose fruit over a regular dessert. He did his little bit of homework, still working on clocks and time, packed up the books he needed in his backpack for tomorrow, and settled in to watch a movie, a treat he was looking forward to on this day with no extra lessons. Bryn set aside his computer and sat on the floor with Riku watching the sci-fi movie, with lots of discussions as to what was happening.</p>
<p>Riku read me a chapter from his book, and for the first time read it by whole phrases, not just one word after another. He was very pleased with himself and how that sounded; I think it makes it easier for him to know what the story is too. </p>
<p>Akane made up a curry dish for dinner, and left for her class just before 6. While the children finished their dinners, Bryn played some music for them, starting with Abba, so that I could see both of them throw their arms out and sing "Knowing me, knowing you! ..." Hilarious. They both have lovely voices and enjoy singing so much.</p>
<p>Mirei decided she wanted to sleep with me tonight, and so Bryn tucked her into my bed at 7:30 and ended up staying there until I went to bed just after 11 o'clock. I tucked Riku in upstairs, promising to stay with him until he was asleep which took about seven minutes! I was downstairs at 7:50, and had the evening on my own.</p>
<p>p.s. I took a photo of the lovely silhouette of leaves on the window screen in my room.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/friday_tbd.html">A Walk Along the River and a Bike Ride Too!</a></h2>
								<p>The sun was shining beautifully this morning as Riku and I walked to school. The air was warm and, after saying goodbye to Riku, it seemed the perfect day to go for a walk along the river.</p>
<p>It's a lovely pathway, which goes on for miles; there are no bikes allowed, and there weren't many people out walking this early. I thoroughly enjoyed the quiet hour, and the long slow walk, not feeling the need to rush home and get warm! I stopped to take photos of the water, duck families, and a few of the egrets I spotted nesting or fishing in the low grassy areas just below me. </p>
<p>Akane took the train to Osaka this morning, leaving as soon as she dropped Mirei off at school. Lovely day for this trip. </p>
<p>About 12:30, Bryn suggested we got for lunch at a cafe up the river in the opposite direction I had taken this morning. Since it would have taken quite a long time to walk there, we set off on the bikes, me for the first time in perhaps eighteen years or so. I walked with the bike on the most narrow areas, not quite confident of my ability to not knock into someone walking or riding coming along in the opposite direction. I so enjoyed riding when the road was wide and clear!</p>
<p>Lunch was delicious and plentiful, a larger portion than is generally served in Japan. The dish Bryn had recommended I try is called a "Loco Moco", a dish of a fried egg, atop a hamburger patty of some kind (mine was vegetarian), and that atop a mound of rice. It is surrounded by a gravy, and on the side was mashed kobocha squash, one of my favourite vegetables here, with two crisply cooked very tasty green beans stuck in the top of the squash. Since it was more than I could eat, I had to leave some of it behind. No "doggie bags" in Japan (although Akane told me later that some places allow you to bring your own containers and take it home with you). I was sorry I wasn't able to save it for dinner that evening.  </p>
<p>Two extra bits... this cafe had one of the Japanese toilets I like so much; the seat was warm, and there were all the fun buttons to push that I remember from Sakai. </p>
<p>I noticed baskets sitting beside the tables in the cafe, and it was a very clever idea... to be used as a spot for purses, bags, etc. instead of having to put them on the floor. I did take a photo of this, but didn't include it in this entry. </p>
<p>Riku usually has his piano lesson right after school, but today it started an hour later. So, I got in my second walk to school today, and a little free time with Riku before he and Bryn went off on the bike. </p>
<p>Friday night is a night to relax here; no school the next morning, no rush to get homework done, etc. so the children watched a favourite tv show, and we all settled in for the weekend. </p>
<p>Big day for Riku tomorrow afternoon... his piano recital! We're all very excited about it, but Riku seems to be taking it all in stride. </p>
<p><a href="/i/2010-03-04%201646%2745.jpg"><img height="200" src="/i/2010-03-04%201646%2745-thumb.jpg" width="300"></a> <a href="/i/2010-03-04%201656%2710.jpg"><img height="200" src="/i/2010-03-04%201656%2710-thumb.jpg" width="300"></a> <a href="/i/2010-03-04%201711%2746.jpg"><img height="200" src="/i/2010-03-04%201711%2746-thumb.jpg" width="300"></a> <a href="/i/2010-03-04%201720%2732.jpg"><img height="200" src="/i/2010-03-04%201720%2732-thumb.jpg" width="300"></a><br><a href="/i/2010-03-04%202100%2705.jpg"><img height="200" src="/i/2010-03-04%202100%2705-thumb.jpg" width="133"></a> <a href="/i/2010-03-04%202120%2752.jpg"><img height="200" src="/i/2010-03-04%202120%2752-thumb.jpg" width="133"></a></p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/thursday_tbd.html">Drizzly Busy Thursday</a></h2>
								<p>Riku has a morning routine that suits him to a "t". He wakens about 6:30, turns on the heat in the living room, and then sits at the computer until 7 o'clock playing or watching some form of a Mario set. Bryn is downstairs by that time, and if I haven't made the children's fruit bowls, Bryn does so, and continues on making breakfast. That's my time to shower, so that I can sit with the children while they eat, sometimes reading them a story.</p>
<p>A young girl walked part of the way to school with us today, asking Riku questions about who I was and where I came from. She was very curious and pushed for more detail than Riku normally would have given her. At one point another little girl joined us too, so I took a photo of the trio.</p>
<p>It's grey and drizzly again today, good for all the gardens and plants. I snapped a photo of some spring flowers as Candy had mentioned that her daffodils were coming up in Kanata. There are lots of pansies in pots on doorsteps right now, and flowering cabbage too. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn went out together for a few hours, and I spent most of the time writing emails and working on adding lots of family photos that I discovered from another person researching the same line. So exciting! </p>
<p>I left at 2:40 to pick Riku up from school, and at 3:30 headed off with Bryn by bus to pick Mirei up from the Japanese nursery school she has been attending for two weeks.</p>
<p>Mirei is always ready for a snack at the end of her school day and luckily there is a very nice bakery just a block away; she was a tired girl too, so her dad gave her a shoulder ride. After checking everything out carefully, she chose an unfilled doughnut, with sugar sprinkled on top. After three bites she had had enough, and her dad got to finish it off later on. He said it was delicious and chewy and Akane said that particular bakery is known for its doughnuts. </p>
<p>Back at home, both Riku and Mirei had homework to do. Riku got his out of the way before his karate class, and while he was gone Mirei did hers... it was for her music class, and she was very meticulous and careful with it. She has very good hand control for such a little girl. It was fun to watch her working away with that head down over her paper.</p>
<p>It was still drizzling at 6:20 when I left to walk to Riku's karate class, about a ten minute walk away. I knew that Riku ended the class with some sort of an English command, and I got to hear his voice coming across so clearly, even from outside the closed door. Riku told me later that they had a new teacher who told him that since his English was the best he could keep doing it. I felt a bit self-conscious about going in to watch, but shall do so next time, as Bryn assured me it was fine. </p>
<p>The mother of a classmate, a young girl who goes to Riku's grade school as well, offered us a ride home, but Riku told me he thought we should walk and get some fresh air, so we did so. </p>
<p>Back at home, the two of us had dinner together, and then it was a quick shower for Riku and tuck in time, after hugs and kisses from Mirei, who said she missed us when we were gone. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/rikus_big_day_his_first_piano.html">Riku's Big Day: His First Piano Recital</a></h2>
								<p>Today is the day we have all been looking forward to for some time, to see Riku on stage playing the pieces he has been practicing and enjoying playing for some time. </p>
<p>He and Akane set off at 10:30 for a noon rehearsal, while Bryn, Mirei, and I spent a quiet morning at home. It was raining and we had to take two buses, but she's such a little trouper, easy to travel with and as patient as could be. </p>
<p>When we arrived, not long before the 2 P.M. performance, Riku looked very handsome in his dark slacks and vest, with a white shirt and black tie. Very debonair! He seemed very relaxed about everything, and I don't think it occurred to him to be nervous about this public performance at all. He had a little bit of time to play with his two cousins, who arrived about the same time we did, and then we took our seats and he went off backstage. Akane's parents and sister arrived just in time, so there was a nice family group there for Riku's special day. </p>
<p>The stage was beautifully set with a grand Steinway piano and two big gorgeous displays of flowers. Riku was perhaps the third or fourth child to play; he came out to the front of the stage, bowed without looking out at the crowd, took his seat and played beautifully. He didn't do the usual relaxed swaying he shows at home when playing, but he was certainly relaxed and not at all self conscious about being centre stage. As he bowed at the end of his performance, Haruka, his five-year-old cousin, and Mirei ran up with bouquets to give to him. It was all very sweet. </p>
<p>Riku was one of two boys in the concert, and the other was a teenager. We sat and watched the other pianists, and were all very impressed with the calibre of the talent. It was just sheer pleasure to sit and listen to them and I was especially pleased to hear the teacher play. She's lovely, and I am sure that she is one of the reasons that Riku is doing so well, and enjoying his lessons as he does. She is nurturing and so very encouraging, and also allows her students to choose pieces they would like to play or play them in more than one style. </p>
<p>Riku was on stage for one more piece with all of the younger players, singing "Do Re Me" accompanied by bell ringing, which was lots of fun to see and watch. Following that was a group photo of the students and there were lots of cameras were flashing from all sides.</p>
<p>Before leaving for home, the four children got to spend some time together in the lobby of the hall, until it was time for goodbyes, and we all went our separate ways. We five popped in a cab, as both children were tired, and we were ready to get the evening routine started with them. </p>
<p>After dinner and baths, Akane and Bryn went off with Ayako, to join the Godas for dinner downtown at their hotel, and I tucked the children into bed. </p>
<p>Riku played on the computer for the twenty minutes that it took me to read "Small Pig" to Mirei — she was pointing to all the words she recognized, and learned a couple of new ones too — and leave her sleeping. </p>
<p>After his story, Riku too fell asleep quickly. He went to bed knowing we were all very proud of him. Bryn especially had told him so many times today how proud he was. Riku had enjoyed his day too. Can't wait to see what next year brings ... perhaps Mirei will be on stage too! </p>
<p>I stayed up until Akane and Bryn arrived home at midnight, after a very rare night out for them, perhaps the first since I was here last May. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/slow_sunday.html">Rainy Lazy Day at Home</a></h2>
								<p>Today was a very lazy day for Bryn, Riku, and me, after the busy day yesterday. </p>
<p>Mirei had her French session start a half hour earlier than usual this morning, so she and Akane were out the door by 8 A.M., while the rest of us got to laze around the house. Riku played games on his dad's iPhone, watched a TV show, and got me to work on a few of the new balancing games on the iPhone. He's a patient teacher and congratulated me with encouraging words of praise when I was lucky enough to not sink the star in the "drink" in that one particular game.</p>
<p>I didn't even shower until 10 A.M. but once Bryn went off to a café to work, Riku and I settled into a series of productive things that needed doing, with fifteen-minute breaks in between. He was great and willingly did his journal for yesterday, read a full chapter in the English language book he's working on, did his spelling list with Bryn, checked and packed his school bag for tomorrow, and wrote a thank-you note (complete with a drawing of him at his concert yesterday), to the Doering/Ellis crew. In between he was on the computer for a bit, up in his room playing on his own, or sitting beside me playing one game each on the iPhone. </p>
<p>Akane had spent some time with her parents and sister while Mirei was at her class, and then took Mirei to a birthday party for the little girl who was playing here with her last Saturday. Mirei was in high spirits when she got home, and she and Riku spent some time playing at the table with their little "bugs" from Susan. They both had a little homework to do; Riku wrote his journal page for today while Mirei lay on the floor on her tummy doing her "homework". </p>
<p>As soon as they were finished, the three of us went off for a walk in the rain, carrying our umbrellas, to pick up some milk at a big drug store just a few minutes walk away. I started singing "Singing in the Rain" to them, a big hit with them both, since we sang as much of it as I knew all the way home too. They were singing it in the house and Bryn played it for them at dinner; tomorrow I hope they can see a little video clip too, as I had told Riku about the tap dancing and Mirei about the splashing in puddles in the movie. </p>
<p>While Riku and I were reading in bed, Mirei came in and gave me six or seven big hugs and kisses, and finished off with a butterfly kiss. Off she went to bed with Akane, all glowing in her pink sleepers.  </p>
<p>Riku has caught Mirei's cough/cold and so had another early tuck-in, asleep again at 7:45.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/monday_musings.html">Monday Musings</a></h2>
								<p>... on the way to school today, Riku reminded me to keep an eye out for "the BM on the BM sidewalk", one stretch of a block that seems to be a popular spot for "doggie doo". Almost every day he will tell me that "You almost stepped in some!" although I am actually very careful about watching where I walk. I think he's anticipating my reaction when and if that ever happens. He <strong>is</strong> seven years old, after all.</p>
<p>... While walking home from school this afternoon, Riku and I talked a little bit about the concert on Saturday. I asked him if he had been expecting Mirei and Haruka to go to the edge of the stage with flowers for him and his reply was "No, and they were <strong>so</strong> cute!" They certainly were. </p>
<p>... Riku and I were alone in the house after school today, but had a short "to-do" list from his dad, to be done before game time. Riku's great about just getting to it, though, so did his two sets of homework lickety-split, after his piano practice, which he insisted on doing before even having his snack. What a guy!</p>
<p>... Bryn took Riku off to his karate lesson at 4:45, leaving Miss Mirei and I to entertain ourselves. She sat snuggled in next to me, covered with a blanket, and read five new pages at the end of "Ten Apples up on Top". She doesn't want any help from me once I have told her the word once or twice. I pretended I was sick, Mirei fed me "medicine" ... yummy tiny dots of strawberry candy, and made me lots of delicious bits of "food" from her play kitchen, which we brought downstairs yesterday. </p>
<p>... Akane and Bryn made dinner together tonight and it was wonderful: Bryn made polenta for the second time and we all agree we could eat it regularly, while Akane cooked up a tasty melange of fresh mixed veggies and mushrooms to go along with it. </p>
<p>... We all watched some of a movie during and after dinner: "Kung Fu Panda". Lots of fun and it had Riku and Mirei laughing out loud. </p>
<p>... Akane and Bryn out for a late dinner once the children were tucked in. I was heading off for bed when they came in at 11 P.M. </p>
<p>... Doug was winging his way to England today; I thought of him throughout the day, as he had a very long wait in L.A. before his long flight to the U.K. He'll be settling in now for his first night there. </p>
<p>... lovely relaxed day for everyone.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/soggy_tuesday.html">Lots of "Hellos"!</a></h2>
								<p>... there were lots of big puddles on the way to school this morning. Riku should have worn boots, as his shoes got wet, despite him being careful about where to step ... so I got to explain what a "soaker" was. </p>
<p>... as the week went by, more and more children are greeting me in English or expecting me to greet them first. One sweet little girl this afternoon stood right in front of me to say "Hello", and answered "I am fine, thank you" to my question. Then I pointed to the sky and said "It is raining today." to which she replied "Yes, it is raining today." Each word is pronounced very carefully so sounds a bit stilted, which often makes me wish I could spend an hour or two a week with some of the children who are most enthusiastic about speaking English. </p>
<p>... on the way home with Riku from school, the farmer who works in the fields near Riku's school was pushing a full wheelbarrow of green onions up on the sidewalk. Rarely does a man anywhere close to my age speak to me, but this fellow held up his hand and asked "From?" It was obvious what he meant and so I told him "Canada" to which he replied "Ah, Vancouver"! Bryn says that is a result of the Olympics being held there just over a week ago, so that was an unexpected and very pleasant interaction. I'm sure I will see him again. </p>
<p>... just over the bridge, a small city truck with three workers in the front seat pulled up for the red light. They were obviously paying attention to the stranger in their midst, and so I smiled and did the little bow as I did so. The driver rolled down his window, and in Japanese he, and the other two fellows too, said "good afternoon" in Japanese. They directed it at Riku as well and so we both replied. </p>
<p>... Riku asked me to go into the big convenience store with him a few days ago so he could point out one of his favourite treats to me: a corn dog. He mentioned it again yesterday so today I remembered to take my wallet with me and bought one for part of his after-snack. I told him how much Auntie Kelly and Caillie like the Morningstar veggie corn dogs, and he is looking forward to trying them in the summer when he visits. Akane said she likes them as well. </p>
<p>... Riku's Chinese tutor was here with him today from 3:30-5:30 officially (and for an extra half hour of relaxing/game playing time until 6). Since Riku was out of school at 1:40 today he had time before that for his piano practice with Akane, for some homework on his own, and to finish up a page of math with the tutor. </p>
<p>... Mirei and I played in my very dark bedroom (the metal shades are permanently closed this trip, to keep the room as dark as possible for sleeping), with the tiny and very powerful flashlight I brought with me, and with a tiny pink one of Mirei's too. She was laughing so hard at how big her feet looked shadowed on the wall and ceiling, and her giggling was infectious; we just got sillier and sillier and her cheeks got pinker and pinker! Entertaining this little girl is the easiest thing in the world to do. </p>
<p>Rain all day long and the temps dropped too. Brr-r-r! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/carnivale.html">Carnivale!</a></h2>
								<p>Today Mirei celebrated "Carnivale" at her French nursery school, and I was there to share in it with her. Akane was preparing inari for the snack the children were having at 11 A.M., so I took Mirei off to school for the first time this trip. I was invited to stay in the classroom with her, and helped Mirei and many of her classmates get their costumes on. There were two pirates, Snow White, many princesses (Mirei was one of them), a chimney sweep, two Spidermen, a cowboy, and a couple of animals too, among many others. </p>
<p>They joined up with the Japanese preschoolers who share the same building, meeting in the gym. It was really cold in there, and it was a good thing the children did lots of running around during the various activities that were planned for them ... six children held on to the sides of a plastic sheet, and ran up and down the length of the gym twice, trying hard not to let the ball that was in the centre of it drop. They did so well at this game, all keeping up their sections of the sheet. </p>
<p>Mirei especially loved the ring toss, and she and another girl got to do it over and over, as they were happy to run and collect the rings after the others had finished their turn. The last was a ball toss competition which Mirei found less interesting.</p>
<p>Right after that it was time to watch a bit of an actual parade in France, with her very handsome and very sweet teacher Hugo, explaining what was going on. The children were lined up and got to have their own parade, with lots of flashes going on as the adults took photos of it all. </p>
<p>Lots of food was lined up along two tables, and the children came up with their paper plates to choose their own. Most of them took the chips, tiny packages of cookies, and treats, rather than the sandwiches and more adult food, which was fine, as the adults were hungry and ready to enjoy the rest of it! There was a delicious apple cake, not too sweet, that was so tasty, and I made sure to get one of the inari before they disappeared. One of the moms had made a white chocolate with strawberry confection, cut into tiny squares and covered lightly with powdered sugar. These too were <strong>so</strong> tasty, and I was very pleased when Hugo presented me with the very last one, after he had passed them around the crowd. </p>
<p>It was fun for me; Senko was there, the gal who was over for dinner last Saturday, and after we agreed that it was very cold in the gym, she kindly gave me a "heat pack" which I placed over my turtleneck, and used to keep my hands warm, one at a time! I talked with several of the moms, all of whom spoke some English, and was very pleased to meet the mother of a little boy I had fallen in love with ... quite a short little fellow, big dark eyes, lots of dark curls, and with the most animated and sweet face. I got her email address so that I could send her the photos I had taken of her son, as she arrived later in the morning. </p>
<p>Mirei was out of school at noon hour, but we stayed on for a bit in the gym, playing toss with the pink balloon she had managed to get hold of. We had the whole afternoon at home, making lots of yummy things with the purple Play-Doh, having a late lunch together, and reading too. While Riku read to me, Mirei played a matching game on Riku's iPhone. She's good at it and very quick and each time she finished one she would call out "I did it!" and Bryn and I congratulated her on it. This little girl really knows how to concentrate on things, as she was as still as could be while playing, except for letting us know she had been successful. </p>
<p>I picked Riku up from school, he got his homework and reading out of the way before dinner ... the last of the boxed mac' and cheese (next week it will be made from scratch as the children really like it), and Akane went off to her French class. </p>
<p>During dinner with Bryn, we played a YouTube version of Gene Kelly singing and dancing to "Singing in the Rain". I should have taken a photo of the looks on their faces as he splashed and cavorted in the rain. Riku especially liked the ending when a disapproving policeman showed up to stop it all. </p>
<p>Tub time together tonight ... with Mirei's kitchen items and Riku's dragons sharing the water. At one point Mirei was serving "sparkling juusu" (juice), to one of the dragons. Adorable. </p>
<p>Bryn and I met in the living room before 8 o'clock with both children soundly asleep in their beds.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/greetings_and_happy_birthday_t.html">Happy Birthday to Bryn!</a></h2>
								<p>It's Bryn's 42nd birthday today. All those years ago, Doug was in Calgary, my grandmother was in Ottawa with me, and at midnight she walked me to the cab, down a very icy driveway, when my labour started in earnest. From a doula's point of view, long after the event, I can see it was less than ideal ... I was on my own, no support from family, friends, or even a kind stranger, but was lucky in that I had a very fast easy labour and a beautiful baby boy was handed to me at 3:13 A.M. He had a very large head, a fine hint of reddish hair, blue eyes, and was a sleeper right from the beginning. His sister Kelly was waiting at home and learned early the next morning that she had a baby brother;  Doug met him two days later but Kelly had to wait until we got home six days later. How different birthing experiences are now... thank goodness!</p>
<p>... Bryn often opens a side door of the house to wave goodbye to Riku as we turn the corner on our way down the road; today he had Mirei in his arms, and they spotted a white cat on a roof across the street. As we passed by Riku said to me "That is a beautiful cat, isn't it Nana?" I agreed that it was and he said "It reminds me of Amelia because she has beautiful white hair too."</p>
<p> ... Riku was so pleased to see the farmer's wife today on our way to school. It has been so cold lately that she hasn't been out, but what warm greetings were exchanged today. This woman doesn't just say "good morning" to Riku, but always asks him a couple of questions or has something extra to say to him. Today I asked if I could take a photo of her with him; I was disappointed when she took off the wonderful cotton "pioneer-style" sunbonnet she wears and her heavy rubber apron, but did understand, as a woman, why she would do so. It's a lovely photo of the two of them, both beaming away and I'm so pleased to have it.</p>
<p>... Riku and I noticed snow up on the high hills off to the side of his school. The sun was shining brightly and it was warmer today than the past two days, so my guess is the snow may not be there for long. </p>
<p>... I went for a long walk after leaving Riku. I passed so many children on the way out of the school grounds again today, and I would say that 75% of them now greet me with "Good morning" in English. </p>
<p>... Bryn and I had a mini-celebration at a lovely little cafe while Riku was at his karate lesson. Bryn had told me about the yummy French bread, brushed with olive oil, grilled, and topped with warmed Camembert. Bryn's had either small bits of either grilled sardine or anchovy on top of his, and we both enjoyed large glasses of a delicious sake along with the sunakku (snack). We had ridden the bikes there, and I hit the right hand brake just a little too hard as I was drifting to a stop outside the cafe. I'm glad it happened before the sake, or that would have been blamed for it! </p>
<p>Back at home, Bryn taught Riku the general rules of Sudoku, and we were both amazed at how quickly and how well he picked it up; he was able to put in many numbers and obviously "got it"! He likes numbers though and does well at math so Bryn wasn't surprised that he did. </p>
<p>The evening with the children ended with Mirei trying to kiss her dad, while he pulled back, resisting and resisting... much to her delight, and determination too! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/xxxbowling.html">Bowling!</a></h2>
								<p>Fridays are often bowling nights for Bryn and Riku; they go at the end of Riku's week at school, and after the piano lesson that follows immediately. Mirei has her lesson after Riku, so there is a nice little period of time that a game of bowling fills perfectly. </p>
<p>It has been a while since I bowled, and I was looking forward to this first game ever with Riku. I walked over to the bowling lanes, with careful instructions from Riku that morning as to exactly how I should get there ("Turn right after you cross the bridge, not left to go to school." and "Meet us inside or outside, but the bowling is upstairs and you can show me the way when we get there."... I was to have checked it out while waiting for them). It was a busy place, with fifty-four(!) lanes, but early enough that there were lots of young bowlers there, and very few smokers. </p>
<p>We had a great time; Riku bowled a spare quite quickly, and had a surprisingly thoughtful ball, as often it looked as though it was going to hit the gutter, and then would change its mind and head towards the centre for him. </p>
<p>Next to us was a  large group of very young teens, perhaps fourteen or fifteen, and how those girls fussed over Riku! They clapped when he hit any pins at all, gave him big smiles, tried to engage him in conversation, although he was a bit shy with them, and kept talking to each other about him ... it was obvious that he was the centre of their attentions! </p>
<p>It was fun to watch Riku carefully lining up the pins with ball in hand, letting that ball go, often down on one knee, and then watching it, sometimes leaning one way or another to help it along its way. He just enjoyed the game and didn't worry at all about how well he or any of us were doing. I suppose that will change eventually, so for now we'll just enjoy rolling those balls down the lane! </p>
<p>Bryn won the game of course, then I followed, with Riku not far behind me. We hope to bowl both Fridays left to us here, and later that evening, I told Riku we could bowl in San Francisco with him too. Doug would certainly enjoy a game a week, and we can bowl with Auntie Susan, and the children too. </p>
<p>On the bridge walking home, we passed three girls who also fussed over Riku; when I asked him what they had said to him he replied, "They think I'm cute; they always say that!" </p>
<p>Nice relaxed Friday night at home. Dinner while watching TV is a treat for the children, and for us too. Mirei also wrote her thank-you note for the "bug and track" that Susan sent for her, so it can be mailed tomorrow. </p>
<p>Busy fun end to the week!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/bryns_birthday_celebration.html">Bryn's Birthday Celebration</a></h2>
								<p>Saturday is the one day of the week when no one has to leave the house early, and so we took advantage of it today. I stayed in my PJs for the longest time ever, relaxing over my breakfast while the children sat at the table, working on birthday cards for Bryn. They were careful about hiding them, so he couldn't see them, and after watching Riku set up barriers around his, Mirei followed suit. The children watched some TV, both did their reading, and once I was showered and dressed the three of us set out for a short walk before lunch. </p>
<p>There is a 105Y store near the main grocery store in this little area, and we headed straight for that ... just to look. I hadn't taken my wallet with me, but promised we would go back soon to buy the glittery green necklace and two pink rings set for Mirei, and the helicopter that "really flies" for Riku. On the way home, we passed what Riku has called "the ghost house" since last year. It is dark and tall and a little run down, and as we passed by Riku started telling a ghost story about it. He suggested that I continue, so I did, and then it was Mirei's turn. We kept this up most of the way home, stopping only to see if the "snowman lady" was out today. Alas, she was not, but we always check.</p>
<p>Riku's Chinese tutor, Han, was over from 1-4 this afternoon, so Mirei and I spent some time in my room, she trying hard to help blow up balloons, and helping me wrap gifts for Bryn. She found a little straw hat, and sat on my bed filling it with various kitchen toys, keeping herself happy and occupied for the longest time. </p>
<p>Bryn's birthday dinner was lots of fun for everyone. He had asked for pasta and Akane prepared a really delicious Italian dinner, complete with garlic-y bruschetta, and spaghettini with a very light tossing of tomato sauce, with sauteed mushrooms and spinach on the side. I was in the mood for Italian too, so I enjoyed every single bite of it all, as did we all. </p>
<p>Bryn had asked for chocolate cake as well, and Akane had cycled off in the afternoon to pick up the one she had ordered the other day. It was perfect, a small and oh-so-tasty chocolate treat. Riku watched as Bryn put all forty-two candles on the cake, barely big enough to hold them all, and Mirei spooned out the whipped cream that came along with it. </p>
<p>Bryn was obviously delighted with the sweet cards the children had made for him, and I think the best part of the party was watching their faces as he opened and commented on them. I was very pleased that Bryn liked the cozy L.L.Bean slippers I had ordered for him; Doug had picked the size correctly ... phew. There were a few extra little gifts too from us and he did well in the "spirits" department too, as he received sake and whiskey too. </p>
<p>I was delighted to be here for this birthday celebration, as I don't think it will happen nearly as often as would be ideal. </p>
<p>p.s. Today was also Doug's and my 45th wedding anniversary. We haven't spent many of our anniversaries apart, but today he was in England and I in Japan, a much further distance, for certain, than ever before. We shall celebrate with dinner out one night in San Francisco.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/xxxsunday_meandering.html">Sunday Meandering</a></h2>
								<p>Today was another slow relaxing day, although Mirei and Akane had to dash to get out the door at 8:30 for Mirei's three-hour playdate with her French teacher at his home. Riku got to have a second lazy morning at home, watching a movie, doing bits and pieces of his homework -- journal writing, and reading to me -- in between. He was busy with a new Lego kit, and enjoyed his time at home. </p>
<p>After lunch the children got involved with a movie, and Bryn suggested that I go out for a walk. I was tempted to stay put, as I was comfortable and warm, but he was right ... it was a lovely day, and I took along my book, bought some chips at the local corner store, and sat at the riverside, reading and enjoying the view. There were two children with shorts on, accompanied by their dad, with fishing nets in the shallows on the other side of the river, and I got a bit of a video of one of the egrets fishing and taking off and landing further along as I walked. </p>
<p>I was out for three hours, strolling along, taking dozens of photos of whatever caught my eye, and enjoyed wandering into and out of the many little stores along my route. </p>
<p>I took photos of four different flavoured teas in containers (apple, grape, lemon, and milk), four thick slices of bread for 105Y, four stalks of asparagus for 98Y, and an aisle full of various beers. I took photos of individually wrapped carrots (58Y), eggs sold in tens, not the dozen we buy (208Y), a large variety of prepared fried foods, and hard liquors too, in one of the bigger supermarkets. </p>
<p>One day I will publish all the photos of the tiniest homes set amongst much larger grander homes, tiny shops tucked in beside massive ones, shops attached to homes, and of course lots of planted garden areas everywhere. </p>
<p>On my way home I was rewarded by catching the "snowman lady" just going into her house. I called out to her and she turned, smiling, and gave me permission to take her photo, by sweeping her hand in agreement to my obvious question. What a lovely way to end my walk!</p>
<p>Bryn had been out working at a cafe, and got home shortly after I did. Akane had dinner ready for us, and I sat with the children as they finished eating, bathed them, and got them ready for bed. </p>
<p>Bryn and I had a glass of sake, this evening served in a small wooden box! I quite enjoyed answering emails and working on my family tree, sipping away at it.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/a_new_week_begins.html">My Third Monday in Japan, Already!</a></h2>
								<p>It was a much milder day today walking Riku to school, so I'm hoping for more warm weather in the next two weeks of my stay. </p>
<p>Bryn invited me to have breakfast with him at a cafe I had spotted from my walk along the river last week. He has been there many times, and likes it a lot, so we met at the corner on our side of the river, and walked to this spot, only to find that it is closed the third Monday of the month! We'll go another day, and Bryn suggested a more modest, tinier spot further along and more "in town" than the first one. </p>
<p>I was just delighted with the whole experience. There is only one table, for four, on the right side as you enter. On the left side are five stools and a counter, and behind that counter was the friendliest woman, and a good cook too. </p>
<p>We had the "set breakfast", a staple in Japan (along with "set lunches" and "set dinners"). This means that they offer one specific dish at a set price, with no changes available. Bryn said in most cases, breakfast is a boiled egg, toast, a side dish of some kind, often a salad, and tea or coffee. However, this is the only spot he knows of that serves a fried egg with the meal. Eating eggs in restaurants is often a little tricky for me, as they are often served barely cooked, sometimes with the option of mixing into a hot mixture -- rice, broth, noodles, etc. -- to further cook it, but just the sight of that barely set white and uncooked yolk is enough to turn me off eating at all. He assured me the egg would be perfect here, and it was, exactly the way we cook them here at home. </p>
<p>Our breakfast was this perfectly fried egg, two thick slices of white toast, buttered (<strong>so</strong> good!), and a small bowl set on the plate with crisp fresh lettuce leaves, some other variety of finely chopped lettuce, and half of a tomato, all lightly tossed with a light vinaigrette, and a small dollop of mayo' on the side, which I mixed in. </p>
<p>Tea was served in a blue and white china cup, with the tiniest cream pitcher, only half filled with milk. I was so glad that Bryn didn't take milk in his coffee, as normally I would want about three times that amount in my tea. However, it turned out to be a thick cream, almost like whipping cream, so rich and thick that it was plenty for me. Yum! I'm sorry they don't serve their tea in pots here, as I would always like a second cup. </p>
<p>As we ate, four obvious "regulars" came in, all men, and all non-smokers, much to our surprise and appreciation! They all smiled and said good morning, chatting away to the owner. At one point she came to clear our dishes (and brought us a free cup of green tea too), and told Bryn she had seen me in the neighbourhood taking photos! And then one of the men stopped on his way out the door to let me know that he has seen me walking with Riku, indicating with his hand a smaller person. Such friendly people! I enjoyed it so much that I would like to go back there at least once more this trip. The cost of our meal was just over $10. </p>
<p>We went for a long walk in our neighbourhood, but further afield than I have been before. Bryn wanted to point out some of the larger homes in one area slightly above where he lives, where there is not the usual mix of very poor or modest homes right next to much more expensive homes. Many of these are old "farmhouses", but not anything like what we consider farmhouses at all. These are very large, often very elegant, with elaborate gates, lots of huge rocks, statuary, and on huge lots too. Beautiful. </p>
<p>Bryn also walked me by two shrines/garden areas I haven't been to yet, but which I shall do with Riku next week when he is off school. </p>
<p>Riku read another chapter in his current English book, "Akimbo and the Baboons", to me, Mirei read "Ten Apples up on Top", adding two new words to her reading vocabulary, and we had some free time together before Bryn took Riku off to his karate class at 4:45. I sat with Mirei while she had her dinner, popped her in the tub with lots of kitchen implements from her toy stove set, and enjoyed a quiet dinner with Riku and Bryn once Riku arrived home. </p>
<p>Did some reading this evening and headed for bed at 10 o'clock, after what has become a ritual lately, a nice glass of sake to finish off the day.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/downtown_kyoto.html">Downtown Kyoto</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei and I have a funny little routine when we're walking to the bus; we pretend we are "rushing, rushing, rushing" and then we "relax" or "stroll", then we "hurry, hurry, hurry!" and then we slow down. Mostly Mirei likes to run fast though, so we do more of that than the strolling. </p>
<p>Today I accompanied her to school with Akane, as we had chosen today as the day for me to do a little wandering about in the big downtown centre here. There really isn't anything I wanted to buy, but I always enjoyed meandering around the food floor of the big department stores in Osaka, and it is fun to just poke around a bit. The bigger stores don't open until 10 A.M. so we went to one of Akane's favourite local chains for breakfast. I had a thick slice of white toast, a medium hard boiled egg, and tea, and Akane chose a breakfast sandwich. It was simple and delicious and hit the spot. </p>
<p>For the next three hours we went into two of the biggest department stores, a really great 105Y store, a place Kelly would have loved to have had access to during all the years she was putting together loot bags for Caillie's birthday parties. I could have spent a lot of time and money in there, but I restrained myself and bought only a few items, including a very small bowl and dish for Mirei. </p>
<p>The food floor at Takashimaya was disappointing compared to the branch in Osaka, but Akane was sure I would enjoy the one at Daimaru  and I did indeed. How I love wandering through all the different sections, which take up the entire basement floor of the huge stores. There are bakeries, with rows and rows of fabulous breads, rolls, pastries, cakes, desserts, etc. as well as a French bakery section with custards and tarts, fresh fruit cakes, and cookies. There is a massive area with prepared foods ready to go, and rows and rows of fresh vegetables and fruit (including a melon, a single melon, beautifully packaged and priced at 10,500Y, a little more than $110!) meat sections, pickles, tofu, etc., etc. Amazing! </p>
<p>On our way to two other stores, we walked through a huge shopping area, blocks long, filled with vendors selling everything from food to clothing. There were three young women dressed in kimono, and they happily posed for me when I asked permission to take their photo. At the end of our trip I bought two white t-shirts for myself, one a bargain at Uniqlo priced at 390Y and it is always fun to wander around in Muji too, where I bought three notebooks for family tree work. </p>
<p>Bryn had taken Riku to school today and picked him up. Mirei thought it was only fair that I took her to school today, as "fair" or "not fair" are operative words for her lately. </p>
<p>Mirei had to do her piano practice shortly after she got home from school, and she asked if I would go upstairs to listen to her. I said "Sure, I will bring my tea up with me," to which she replied "What about your camera?" So up I went with my tea and my camera and got my first video of her practicing the piano. We had time to watch a bit of "Mulan 2", a new DVD that Bryn just bought. </p>
<p>Riku was busy with Ma, one of his Chinese tutors, and then it was dinner time, homework, tub, and bedtime. </p>
<p>Another day flew by!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/xxxrikus_last_full_day_in_grad.html">Riku's Last Full Day in Grade One, and Go Fish!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku has either shortened days, or days off school, until the term ends next Wednesday, and he knew he would be bringing home all of his art work. I teased him and told him I would meet him with a small truck after school today, but he came running up to meet me, coat a-flying, big smiles, and carrying a decorated (by him) flat cardboard case with a handle on it ... very efficient and easy to carry. </p>
<p>It was a chilly walk to and from school today; the temperature has dropped again, although it is clear and sunny, just nippy. </p>
<p>Wednesday is Riku's "free" day, with no extracurricular activities, so after he had done his piano practice, and Mirei hers, we all sat on the heated floor mat and watched a good part of "Charlotte's Web" together. Both children read to me too, and Riku finished up his wee bit of homework before Akane left for her weekly French class.</p>
<p>Mirei and I played our first game of "Go Fish" tonight, by asking each other about colours in a random deck of cards. She caught on immediately, carefully placing her pairs together neatly... the better to count them, my dear, as she won both games! It was lots of fun and we will play this a lot over the next ten days I bet.</p>
<p>Bryn made his delicious Spanish omelette for our dinner tonight,  served with steamed broccoli and carrots on the side, and some cucumber slices too. We had a "picnic" on the rug in the living room since Bryn spent most of the day clearing out a piece of furniture in the dining room where games, puzzles, art supplies, stickers, videos, etc. are stored. There was no room at the table for the four of us, so this was a fun change for us. </p>
<p>Riku is using some very grown-up expressions right now, and Bryn and I often find ourselves raising our eyebrows at each other. "Yeah, whatever Dad" said tongue in cheek for sure, "sure Dad" said casually, but with <strong>his</strong> eyebrows raised for effect, and that sort of thing. Hard to keep track of them all, but he's a-changing. </p>
<p>Mirei has a very sure sense of what is right and wrong, what is funny or sad, and what is mean and kind. She speaks right up and I can only imagine how well this sense of what should be, of what is just, will form her as an adult, with justice for all as far as she is concerned. </p>
<p>Last night when we were watching the movie, there is a part where Wilbur the pig realizes he is going to be killed and eaten. The goose doesn't realize that this is also his fate, but Riku got that, and laughed. Mirei spoke right up, saying "Riku! That is not funny. That is sad!" and she was very serious about it. </p>
<p>Riku didn't have dessert last night; he chose not to, but somehow Mirei thought that her dad wasn't allowing him to. So, when Riku was reading to me, she scooted off her chair, came over with a section of string cheese for him, whispered that it was for him 'cause he didn't have dessert, and put her finger across her mouth, saying "shhhh" before heading back to the table. </p>
<p>Riku had a quick shower, and is now washing his own hair and hopping in and out of the tub by himself. Whenever I ask if he wants me to check to see if the shampoo is all out, the answer is, "Don't worry. I've got it Nana." </p>
<p>Bryn went up with Mirei to tuck her in, and read three stories tonight! Riku was asleep by 7:50, and Bryn never did appear for the rest of the evening. No sake for me tonight; I didn't feel like drinking alone.  :) </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/thursday_1.html">Mirei's Turn!</a></h2>
								<p>A few days ago, Mirei realized that I was spending far too much time taking Riku to school, and not her, and I've been hearing "No fair!" So today she and I set off for her school, while Bryn walked Riku to his school. Mirei is a fun little companion; we strolled/ran, ran, ran/strolled to the bus stop, and she chattered all the way there, looking out the window and asking lots of questions. There were a couple of children from her school on the bus too, so as we got closer to her stop, she was happy to stand next to them, saying hello in French to them all. We had taken an earlier bus than would have been ideal as we had more than ten minutes to wait before Mirei could go into her classroom. We found a pair of chairs, and sat working our way through a couple of maze puzzles. </p>
<p>I did some packing up this morning, as Bryn and Akane have some things for me to take back to SF with me, to give away: children's toys, clothes, and a few household items. I caught up on some emails and read the morning away.</p>
<p>I picked Riku up from school as usual; today he told me that each child had to make a card for two children who won't be at the school next year. One is a boy who is moving to Tokyo. He has had some fun times with this boy, but decided at some point fairly recently that he thinks he is a "mean boy". He wasn't happy about having to make a card for him, and wished he hadn't had to make it. Riku felt quite strongly about it, saying he hadn't done a good job on it, and wished too that he could have said he was happy he was leaving. We had a long discussion about how this all felt, and that one of the good things about being a grown-up was not having to do that kind of thing, but learning how to ignore people we don't like, while still being polite. </p>
<p>Riku had his busy Thursday routine with piano practice and homework before karate class.</p>
<p>I left the house at 3:15 to meet Mirei at school, and was greeted with her usual big sunny smile. After taking her photo in a local phone booth, where she posed happily for me, we bought her a muffin at the local bakery. There are no afternoon snacks at French school, so she is always ready for a big snack. The muffin and a bag of pistachios kept her tummy filled until she got home. <br />
 <br />
At home we played another game of "Go Fish", which she won again! She was a busy girl,  playing with a Lego house Riku had built with her Lego pieces, and the white mouse puppet Jody had bought for Riku when he was a little fellow. She had him picking up Lego pieces to play with her, and insisted that I take her photo with him/her. We had lots of time together today! </p>
<p>The other day I told Mirei I just had to grab my coat to go somewhere, and she called out "How about your camera?" So many photo opportunities not to be missed! After dinner with Akane, Mirei whipped up "a strawberry white cake with icing on it" in the tub for me. She really likes cooking while bathing and whips up lots of goodies while soaking in the deep tub. </p>
<p>Late dinner together with Riku, and lots of computer time while Akane watched a longer than usual TV special.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/four_day_weekend_begins.html">Four Day Weekend Begins</a></h2>
								<p>... for Riku. He had today off school, although was given six pages of homework to do as it's not a holiday, just time away from school while a graduation ceremony is held for the grade six classes today. </p>
<p>I was taking Mirei to school this morning and at the last minute Riku decided he would come with us on the bus. It was a bit of a dash, and we ran most of the way to the bus stop, arriving with about thirty seconds to spare. Whew! Riku and Mirei wanted to sit beside each other and it was fun watching them work a maze book together, and chat away. </p>
<p>Mirei was just adorable at school, proudly tapping classmates on the shoulder, and then sweeping her arm toward Riku when they turned around, pointing out Riku to them, with the biggest smile on her face. She even got to show him off to her teacher, which made her especially happy. </p>
<p>Riku spent the morning with me, working away on one of his sheets of work with a break to do something fun in between. He's a whiz at math and it didn't take him long to go through the 84 addition and subtraction questions on each of four of the sheets, although he wasn't always happy about having to do them. A snack, a bit of tv, and some iPhone games were his rewards. </p>
<p>He was supposed to practice jump roping too, and so we went outside so he had company while he skipped. I had no idea Riku could skip at all, and thought we were going out for him to learn how to do it, so I was very happy to see him jumping while running ten or more times, but not, of course, when I was taping him! Akane and I both did a little skipping too. I have a feeling when I come back next year Riku will be skipping very well, as it's something they seem to do now in schools, both here and in San Francisco. </p>
<p>We walked up to the playground where he did some more skipping in a larger area, and played with some local boys who were gathered there, boys from school, but not in his class, and from his karate class. He was happy though to come back and join me, where I sat in the sunshine, and chat while he skipped some more. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/xxxneedles_and_a_hair_cut.html">Needles and a Hair Cut</a></h2>
								<p>Akane, Riku, Mirei, and I were out the door at 9ish this morning for a walk to the children's doctor, whose office is on the road beside the river. As we were dashing along to the main street, the farmer's wife stopped Akane to tell her she was going to bring over some seasonal greens, with yellow flowery tops, for me. </p>
<p>She and Riku had lots of fun playing together in the waiting room; it's interesting to see how shy Mirei is with strangers and she took Riku by the hand to go over with her to play with the building blocks. </p>
<p>Mirei had talked herself into being very brave again this morning, but at the last minute, as she spotted the needle, she cried. Poor wee girl. It's hard to see this, but I know it's necessary. She sobbed in my arms while Riku had his, and soon we were on our way home again. </p>
<p>Riku had said last week that his hair was driving him crazy, and he wanted to get it cut on Saturday, but he resisted the idea, suggesting it happen tomorrow instead. Akane stopped in at a local spot to ask the price: ¥2000, so over $20 for a child's cut. She decided later that day that she would cut it herself. </p>
<p>Akane made rice stuffed omelettes for lunch today—delicious—and then Riku had his three-hour session with his Chinese tutor. Mirei would love nothing more than to join in and make it a threesome, so she and I went for a walk, first to the "old" playground, where there really isn't much to do, so we soon after walked to a small shrine area close by, where she put her little hands together twice, once at a pump, and before entering a sitting area. She picked some tiny flowers ("weeds") for Akane, and we moved on to the second playground, past the house in the opposite direction. </p>
<p>Mirei was interested in finding bugs today, so spent lots of time crouched down, turning over small rocks, etc. She was especially delighted when I spotted a mostly black ladybug and convinced it to walk on a leaf she picked, and then go for a walk on her hand. I took some lovely shots of her, one in which she looks very much like her Auntie Ayako. </p>
<p>It was really warm outside today, and with no wind at all,  so for the first time this trip we didn't wear our jackets. Hope it keeps up! </p>
<p>Once home again, we went into my room while Riku had his last half hour with Han. We read three stories, and then Mirei kept busy with a square of pink paper, carefully turning down the corners and then taping them, before cutting out bits to tape onto a square of silver paper. She's very meticulous and patient, this little girl.</p>
<p>Bryn was busy all this time finishing up sorting through more "stuff", in his quest to lighten up the household; I could use this boy at my house!, </p>
<p>When it was time for Riku's haircut, he sat on a chair in front of the TV, watching a movie with Mirei, with a plastic clothes/body protector around his neck to keep the hair off him. It worked beautifully, and Riku sat patiently while Akane snipped away. His hair looked so much better almost instantly, as Akane does a great job at shaping it. </p>
<p>Chinese food was ordered in for dinner. It comes on individual plates or in bowls, some plastic, some ceramic, and the next day the driver comes by and picks them up from outside the front door. Akane had ordered a gingery-flavoured vegetable dish for me, enough for two meals, and Bryn fed Riku the fresh noodle dish while he had his hair cut. I must say I could not keep my eyes off this boy; his hair is so thick and it doesn't have to get very long before his fine features are lost in it. </p>
<p>Ayako was here when I came out from tucking in Riku. She is here for two nights and I know the children will be delighted to see her in the morning. Once Akane was down from tucking Mirei in, the two of them headed out for dinner together. I happily wrote some emails and went to bed at a decent hour.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/sunday_visitor.html">Sunday Visitor and Lots to Do!</a></h2>
								<p>The children were unaware last night at bedtime that their Auntie Ayako (Aka-chan), would be here this morning, and they were just delighted when they found out. Riku and I had our usual quiet early morning time together, arising at our usual 6:30 A.M.and once Ayako was up had lots of time with Ayako and Mirei. </p>
<p>The day was busy, with lots of activities: all three of them watched part of the Durimon movie with Ayako, then Riku had her to himself for a bit, starting a science experiment while Mirei did her piano practice. Mirei and I had been playing with the Play-Doh, and then I had fun watching Mirei with Ayako, as they made pizzas and iPhones with it too! I got a cute photo of Mirei showing hers off to her dad. At one point, Akane, Ayako, and the children were involved in the experiment, making crystals grow. Stay tuned: that happens next weekend! </p>
<p>I made "creamy" mac' and cheese for lunch, one of Riku's favourite dishes in SF, and here too, as a big bowl was gone in no time flat! I am hoping the cheddar cheese Bryn had me bring lasts long enough for one more meal of it for them. </p>
<p>Mirei went off for three hours with her French teacher this afternoon, instead of the usual morning lesson, while Akane and Ayako ran some errands. Bryn was continuing on with his cleaning and purging home project, so Riku and I went up to do the same in his room. Riku has no trouble at all getting rid of things he no longer uses; he is ruthless, and doesn't even hesitate, so I easily filled a bag full of toys. I have a feeling it won't be this easy if I get to do this with Mirei's side of the room! </p>
<p>Mirei read to Bryn tonight from "Ten Apples up on Top";  I did a little recording, but always seem to get her when she is being especially silly. However, she is close to finishing off the book completely on her own, and Riku and I read another chapter in his ongoing English book too. Busy day in all! </p>
<p>Akane cooked up a special meal (while Riki and I did a 100-piece puzzle) ... one she had promised Riku that she would make this weekend. The other three adults were going out for a late dinner, so it was all for the children and me. </p>
<p>While Riku and I were upstairs today, the farmer's wife came over with the promised seasonal greens, and so there was a wonderful assortment of vegetables grilled at the table ... the greens, with tiny yellow flowers, mushrooms, kabocha squash, sliced very thinly, as well as carrots, onions, and cabbage, along with a bowl of rice for each of us. While Akane cooked the thin slices of meat and sausages for the children in the kitchen (usually done on the grill as well), Bryn tended to the veggies and I ate my full of it all. Yum! </p>
<p>It was a fun dinner as Bryn and I told stories and sang songs from our childhoods ... Bryn remembered the song his Grandma Dyment sang to his dad: "I know a little boy, sly and deceitful ..." which Mirei heard for the first time the other day on the bus and thought was very mean. It is. And Riku has heard at least one of my family stories often enough that he knows that if I, or any of my siblings, laughed at the dinner table — silly, out of control laughing, the way Mirei was laughing tonight — that we got to sit on the dark basement steps. Mirei insisted on telling stories from her childhood too, usually involving lots of tales of her gurgling and gooing, and her dad baby-talking to her. She kept track of just whose turn it was to tell a tale too. </p>
<p>Quiet productive evening on my own, as the children were asleep by 8:15, Akane, Ayako, and Bryn left for dinner, and I got a few emails written and went through photos from the last couple of days. </p>
<p>At tuck-in time, Riku counted how many nights we have left together: ten. He thinks that sounds like a lot, but I know how very quickly they will pass. </p>
<p>Doug arrived home from England today after a very busy fun eleven day trip there. I'm looking forward to hearing all the stories, and seeing his photos when I get home. </p>
<p>P.S. Late this afternoon, Riku was leading an "exercise class" with Mirei his only student. They were leaning over sideways, stretching out their arms, and Bryn decided to join them. Mirei told him he couldn't because Riku was the teacher and she was the girl. Bryn suggested that he could be "the boy" but Mirei gave him a little push, telling him "No! I am the girl and you are too big!"</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/xxx_holiday_monday.html">Holiday Monday</a></h2>
								<p>Holiday or not, Riku was out of bed at 6:30 on the dot, but this morning Riku pulled the covers up over my shoulders and kissed the top of my head before sliding the door shut. Usually he leaves it open as he wants me up asap; it was sweet and I snuggled in for an extra five minutes before joining him in the dining room. </p>
<p>The children had a great holiday; it was fun from morning until night for them, with lots of time for playing. Ayako and Akane went out during the morning and early afternoon, and while they were gone I watched a movie with the children, sat with Riku while he read his chapter, while Mirei read to Bryn, and later on I read to Mirei. She and Riku spent lots of time upstairs playing together, and playing pirates and "bad guys" down here with Bryn and me. Mirei was in an adorable costume and looked like a Spanish señorita in black and red... or as Bryn and I decided later, a dance hall girl! </p>
<p>Bryn continued on with his cleaning and purging project, this time working away in the kitchen. My intention was to spend more time with Riku going through his room, but the children played happily together and the time flew by. </p>
<p>Once Akane and Ayako came home, I left for a one-and-a-half-hour walk. It was quite mild out, despite the house feeling much colder today, and I meandered up to the area that Bryn and I explored last week. </p>
<p>I headed uphill, walked alongside a bamboo forested area, and spent a long time in a cemetery built on a hill, with many levels of concrete and stone headstones, some very simple and some very elaborate. There were many people in the cemetery sweeping, clearing out weeds, leaving biscuits and fruit on the base of the stones; the smell of incense was in the air. </p>
<p>I took lots of photos before leaving and walking downhill, stopping to snap more photos of homes, large and small, before heading heading home again. </p>
<p>I stopped in at the Karan bakery, where Akane had bought Bryn's delicious chocolate cake. I have been in three times now, just to look at the lovely pastries, but have never bought anything, but today ran into Ayako who had stopped on her way back to Sakai to pick up some treats for Masu. </p>
<p>The children continued to keep themselves busy, spent quite a bit of time playing outside together. When I came back from my walk, Mirei was out there on her own, with a pad of paper, writing a "letter" for me; she proudly presented me it to me later on, after she had coloured all the hearts on it pink. They came in while dinner was being made and had a long fun bath together. </p>
<p>While the children were finishing up their dinners, Riku suggested we play a game together. He decided we should name our favourites of various things ... dinner, dessert, fruit, drink, number, colour, etc. It was fun with Bryn and Akane joining in too, and led to some interesting discussions. Mirei was hilarious and took her turn very seriously, insisting that she follow Riku and obviously thinking about her answers. </p>
<p>Here are a few of them: Favourite food? Riku - sushi, Mirei - pizza, me - tofu, Bryn - pizza, and Akane - sushi. Fruit? Riku - pear(!) (not strawberries, much to my surprise!), Mirei - mango! (another surprise answer), me - cherries, Bryn - a really good orange, Akane - mango stem. </p>
<p>The children had a little more time together after dinner too. Mirei put on her coat for some reason, as this is a child who never needs a second layer on! Funny little girl... </p>
<p>Riku was heading into bed at 7:20 and had been promised two stories because it was nice and early. We are reading a "classic" series written in comic book form by Hathway, The Brothers Grimm, and Aesop's Fables, and I was taking some time tonight to explain a few things to Riku. About half way through the first book ("Johnny Appleseed")  Riku suggested that maybe I should just keep reading, and read fast, because we had to read another book ("The Magic Pitcher"). He was yawning, and so was I, so read I did!</p>
<p>I finished off my John Steinbeck book, chose photos from Bryn's computer and wrote some emails on Akane's, while she and Bryn sorted through some containers together. I got lots done and went off to bed before 11 P.M.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/the_farmer_and_photo_ops.html">The Farmer and Photo Ops</a></h2>
								<p>On our way to school today, Riku was delighted to spot the farmer we haven't seen together since I arrived here this trip. He was standing with a woman wielding a wheelbarrow, one of his helpers, who was very pleased to see Riku; there were lots of big smiles exchanged. This was the fellow who gave me the huge cabbage last May, and it was lovely to see him again. I took a couple of photos, of course! </p>
<p>I passed a long narrow field of the yellow topped greens that the farmer's wife had brought over for me to try, so snapped a photo of those growing. They look like pretty weeds to me, and I would never have guessed they were a crop.</p>
<p>Riku and I sang all the way to school this morning, and talked about how a song gets in your head and doesn't go away until you sing something else. He was quite taken with "Lollipop, Lollipop" which he heard yesterday in the movie we watched, and I must remember to have Bryn play it for him tonight. I think Riku could easily be a fan of 60s music! </p>
<p>There was a woman with a big woven straw basket out cutting cabbages in the field by the school, after Riku and I had snuck in our goodbye kisses. After taking a couple of surreptitious photos of her from the back, she turned at one point and called out "ohayo gozaimasu" (sort of pronounced "ohio goes-ay-maws"). I took advantage of her big smile to ask if I could take her photo, and was rewarded with a big smile and a "yes". She thanked me after I took it, and I, of course, thanked her. Lovely people here. </p>
<p>Riku was out of school at 12:15 today; it was rainy but his smile was sunny as he came toward me. I do love these walks to and from the school with him; I know the time will come when he prefers to walk on his own. </p>
<p>Akane was home to make a hot tasty lunch for Bryn and Riku, and cooked up some fried tofu in broth, along with some noodles and veggies for me later on. Yum! </p>
<p>Riku had a sheet of homework to do, did his piano practice with Akane, and then he suggested that he read me a chapter in his book; he's anxious to have his dad download a game for him on the iPhone, which happens when he has finished this second reading of the book about baboons. </p>
<p>It was a coldish, dreary day, and at one point I told him it was the kind of day when I would like to lie on the sofa, with a box of chocolates at hand, and nibble and read the afternoon away. He thought that sounded great, went off and put some M&M-like candies in a little cup, and we did exactly that. We covered up with a blanket, Riku would read a page, eat a candy, and hand one to me, and on we went until the end of the chapter. </p>
<p>He had a longer spell of playtime before his tutor came at 3 o'clock. Akane had an errand to run and picked up Mirei, so I remained cuddled up on the sofa and used the computer, catching up on emails. </p>
<p>At 5:30, Bryn suggested that I join him on a snack run to the 7/11. It was raining hard, so we headed off with brollies up for Bryn's canned coffee drink and BBQ/salt & vinegar Pringle-style potato chips. I thought there was a good chance that we would run into Akane and Mirei, and sure enough, we stood and watched a couple of buses go by, and Mirei, who never misses a thing, spotted us from the bus. What big smiles greeted us when she and Akane alit. We held hands and huddled under the brolly the few blocks home.  </p>
<p>I convinced her to have her tub time early, and she mixed me up a yummy cake again while standing in the tub. She was warm and pink-cheeked after her bath, and all ready for bedtime once her dinner was over. </p>
<p>Riku gave up some free time after dinner to make a card for his teacher, rather than use his half hour in the morning to do so. It was a drawing of the school, and of course I took a photo of it. </p>
<p>Akane fell asleep with Mirei tonight, so I had the use of the computer all evening, until bedtime just past 11 P.M. I made good use of the time too, as Bryn sent all the photos I have taken so far to Doug, and I sent Doug a list of photos that can be uploaded to my last week's worth of blog entries. Bryn played all the videos I had taken too, so that was lots of fun, exclaiming over them together. </p>
<p>Cold nights again; glad I have my two warming units tucked in with me, my bed "buddy" (grain filled bag that gets heated in the microwave)  and Riku too!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/rikus_last_day_in_grade_one_an.html">Riku's Last Day in Grade One and Three Meals Out for Me</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn and I both walked Riku to school in the rain today, after deciding to have breakfast at the spot along the river that was closed last week. We were waiting outside the restaurant at 8:50 when the owner showed up; he opened the door five minutes early for us, and invited us into his very elegant, yet somehow rustic, dining rooms. </p>
<p>Bryn likes this spot very much and I can see why. There is lots of wood, all gleaming, china teacups hanging on a rack above the bar/serving area, china figurines in small alcoves set into the windows, with a warm homey atmosphere. I liked it immediately and settled into the comfy chairs for a lovely breakfast with Bryn. We had the "set breakfast" which included a boiled egg with our toast, a tasty salad of greens, and another cup of delicious tea with pure cream... that might be the secret! That, and always wanting <strong>more</strong>. </p>
<p>It was still pouring rain when I walked to meet Riku at noon hour, when school was dismissed for this year, and to my surprise Riku was well on his way home already. I am very happy I am going to have some free time with him before I leave for home next week. </p>
<p>Bryn suggested we go out for lunch, once again choosing a little neighbourhood spot that was closed the first time we tried to eat there. Riku was all for it, and since I knew there wasn't much on the menu for vegetarians, I suggested they go out on their own. They both nixed that, so off we went in the rain. Once again it was closed, but Bryn had another idea, a local spot a few blocks away. I was <strong>so</strong> happy I hadn't stayed home as I had one of the most delicious pasta dishes I have ever had... a very creamy sauce over perfectly cooked pasta, with asparagus and mushrooms. It could not have been better! </p>
<p>Riku was on his way to meet his Mom and Mirei for a movie, but asked if he could have cheesecake for dessert. Bryn suggested he wait and have popcorn, but after making it clear that cheesecake was what he really really wanted, I promised I would buy him dessert. How that boy enjoyed that "It's not-too-sweet Nana" cake. </p>
<p>He and Bryn played a bit of a game on Riku's iphone, and worked some "finger puzzles" too until our lunch was served. Bryn had shrimp, I believe, with his pasta and we all enjoyed our meal. Riku ate every bite of his cheesecake too. </p>
<p>I walked home after saying goodbye to them as they boarded the bus to meet up for the movie, and headed home for two hours, to warm up and go through some of the photos I had taken over the last few days. </p>
<p>At 6 P.M., after catching the bus downtown, I was waiting to meet up with the family at a sushi restaurant with the revolving food service. The children especially like to eat here, although Riku let Mirei take the dishes off tonight, so that I could sit between them. It's always a bit hard for me to see anyone eating raw fish, but I enjoyed sitting watching the stack of plates build up! Everyone ate well, and for surprisingly little money, I believe. I wasn't terribly hungry and so ate a small portion of tamago and the glazed sweet potatoes with black sesame seeds. Yum! </p>
<p>Bus ride home, quick bedtime routine, and this lovely day came to an end.  </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/xxxflea_market_and_a_very_rain.html">Flea Market and Happy First Anniversary for Akane and Bryn</a></h2>
								<p>At 8:15 this morning we all left the house with Mirei to drop her off at school, and head on to the monthly flea market held on the grounds of a temple. We all stood waving to Mirei as she climbed up the few stairs to the building, but she was already doing her usual routine, greeting other students, and getting on with her day.</p>
<p>It was not a great day for this outing, as it was raining when we left the house and raining harder by the time we got there. The buses were crowded with tourists, more crowded than I have ever experienced here. The minute we hit the grounds, Riku smelled food cooking and asked if he could have oden, a mixture of foods (potatoes, carrots, daikon radish, sausage, fish cake, and shelled hard boiled eggs, all simmered together in a fish broth). Akane makes this at home, and it's one of Riku's favourite dinners. Bryn said it is also available at most corner stores, and is a popular take-out dish. He and Akane organized that for him, and we found a table under a big tent.</p>
<p>Bryn bought me a roasted ear of corn on a stick ... it would have been better if it had been hotter, although it is also traditionally served with soy sauce on it, and Bryn opted not to get that for me in case it wasn't my cup of tea. Hmm-m ... not sure. </p>
<p>We walked around checking out each of the many many booths, although Akane did say when the weather is better it is much more crowded, and with far more booths selling goods and foods. I was disappointed not to have had a chance to try the steamed potatoes that both Akane's father and sister enjoy so much, as it was one of the booths that chose not to be out in this inclement weather. Next time! </p>
<p>Riku was cold, even though I put my fleecy jacket under his rain coat, and he was bored too, so he and I caught two buses home, stopping in at a bakery near Mirei's school for a tiny pizza and a bun for him, and a crusty French roll for me. We nibbled discreetly away at them on the bus home, which was not crowded, and was toasty warm to boot. The buses are often too hot there but today it felt wonderful. </p>
<p>Home for hot chocolate and a snack, then we read the very last chapter in the baboon book. Bryn had promised that as soon as he had read the book to me twice, he would get him a much longed-for game called "Plants vs Zombies"! Within minutes after Bryn and Akane walked in the door, it was being downloaded to the iPod Riku uses. Happy boy! He has been reassuring me all week that it is not really a killing game, as they aren't people, but zombies, and zombies are not real, etc. etc. He knows I wouldn't want him even pretending to kill real people and is very sensitive to my feelings about it all. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn arrived home with the perfect sized (and priced) narrow short bench to hold Akane's purse, bags, etc. (made by a craftsman who uses no nails or screws, and makes the boxes that hold the instruments for the tea ceremonies, in temples). Another great find was a green enamel baking dish that Bryn and I had spotted at the same time, to be used to hold the three remotes in the living room. The final buys and bargains of the day were two more boxes: one, of burnished copper, they can use to hold a small vase of flowers, or the small collections of seeds and/or single flowers the children bring home (pictured below). The second box found a home in the corner of the kitchen counter, a spot Bryn has never been happy with. Now it holds the butter container, a glass jar of elastics and twist ties, the daily vitamins, and the candy jar, all gathered together in one unique wooden box. </p>
<p>Riku and I spent some time on the sofa while he demonstrated his new game to me; I even got to move the sun at one point to keep the zombies at bay. His little fiingers are far quicker than mine though!</p>
<p>When it was time for a break from the game, he wrote a card to a former classmate at Starr King, did his piano practice with Akane, and all told had a relaxing few hours before heading out with his dad at 4:45 for his karate class. </p>
<p>It seemed a long day without Mirei today as she had gone to the dentist after school with Akane. She apparently was not the least bit cooperative and although she didn't fuss at all, she flat out refused to open her mouth for him! So, no cleaning, no proper check up, and no snack on the way home, which did not make her happy. Poor wee girl ... life is tough. </p>
<p>I had made mac' and cheese for the children's dinner while they were out, and had it all ready for hungry Mirei to eat, along with sautéed spinach, and a mixture of carrot and kabocha squash, cooked together and mashed with butter. I sat with Mirei while she ate; she was a tired girl and I read some stories before she went off with a quick tub time with her mom. Early to bed tonight for her.</p>
<p>Riku came home from karate, a hungry boy, and polished off his big bowl of dinner in no time flat. Tuck-in time with him at 7:45. </p>
<p>I just could not get warm today; I sat with the heated up "bed buddy" on my lap when on the computer or reading on the sofa, and told Akane I had three layers on. She upped the ante, as she was wearing five! Brrrrrr! </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn went to a local bar just before 10 P.M.This gave me some time to work on  a contact from England via Ancestry ... one of my grandmother's maternal relatives. It's a relaxing way to end my day, and I was especially relaxed after the tall glass of Japanese potato "vodka" Bryn handed to me earlier in the evening, and a cup of warm sake before they went out. Yawn! </p>
<p>p.s. I haven't had my calendar out in a place that I see it, so I miss special days I am usually aware of at home. It was two days later before I realized that today had been Akane and Bryn's first anniversary. Bryn was happy they had spent some time at the flea market alone together, had a tasty lunch out alone, and come home with some very nice household items for their home ... even if they hadn't realized at the time that it was their anniversary gift to each other!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/friday_the_weekend.html">Friday ... And Riku Gets a Strike!</a></h2>
								<p>I suggested to Riku this morning that he bring his iPod with his new game into bed with me, rather than sitting at the table in the not-yet-warmed-up dining room. I gave him permission to bring his peeled banana and orange into bed too, a real treat, as eating in a tatami room is generally not allowed. He was very careful, knowing it was a special treat. We have big puffy duvets on the futons, and nothing was messy or crumbly, so there we were, snug as bugs in rugs for the first half hour of our day. Lovely! </p>
<p>I took Mirei to school this morning; we had lots of time to get to the stop, but of course did our usual "run, run, run!", and "stroll, stroll, stroll" for the first two blocks. Then we really did just stroll, as Mirei spotted a tiny sparrow, told me she liked little birds, but not big ones like crows, and proceeded to make up a song. It went along these lines: "tiny bird, in a nest, growed up, left the nest, mommy sad, the bird came back, was little again", and on it went. Very endearing little song it was.</p>
<p>The first thing Mirei does when she gets on the bus, in her favourite seat near the back, is take off her backpack, take off her jacket, and settle in. This morning, Riku had drawn five pages for a "book", making it up from a story we read yesterday called "Three Golden Keys". He ran to the door with it at the last minute, suggesting that we read it on the bus. I snapped a photo of Mirei on the bus that reminds me so much of her Baba, Akane's mother. There are times that Mirei looks very much like her or Auntie Ayako. Bryn and Akane can see it too. </p>
<p>Riku and Akane were watching a Japanese ninja movie from Akane's childhood, when I walked in, so I checked my email and then sat at the table eating my regular egg and toast breakfast with tea. The movie over, Riku sat beside me to draw. Then he read "Starry Messenger" to me, a lovely book that Garry had given him when he was just a little fellow; we all like this book and series very much. </p>
<p>Riku went off to the dentist with Akane for a noontime appointment, then home for lunch, with a thick comic book, which had him laughing out loud so hard that it made the three adults looking up at each other with huge smiles. Bryn said later he envied Riku those huge belly laughs.</p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon flew by. Riku drew a picture of lots of bugs on a letter that he will write to Amelia tomorrow. Next he read half "The Starry Messenger" to me, paying close attention to all the tiny drawings, and then we went up to his room to do some more sorting out. Riku is very clear about which toys he wants and which he doesn't, which makes it much easier to tidy up and make more room. We should all be so decisive! </p>
<p>Bryn and Riku left on the bike at 4:45 for Riku's piano lesson, an hour later today, and I walked to the bowling alley an hour later to meet them. This was a perfect time to go, as it was almost empty. Riku played first and to his utter amazement and delight he got a strike with his first ball! Bryn got one also, a little later on, but it wasn't my day for more than a spare. It was such fun, and I'm so glad we managed to get there again. </p>
<p>Home for a yummy pasta dinner that Akane cooked up, a half-hour TV show for the children, while they finished off the last of the caramel corn, and tuck-in just after 8 for Riku. Bryn cleared my camera card and I went through the last few days of photos and wrote emails on his computer until bedtime, after my glass of OJ with Japanese vodka. </p>
<p>Only four more sleeps until I leave Japan. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/a_quiet_saturday_at_home.html">A Quiet Saturday at Home</a></h2>
								<p>Riku dashed out of bed this morning, and came back with his new and big Japanese comic book, to read in the warmth of the bed until the living room warmed up. Mirei slept in today but once she was up and the two of them had their breakfasts they played with the Blockus game we had found in Riku's room a few days ago. They made up their own rules, with Riku overseeing it all, and then Riku and Akane had a real game. He's good at it, and Bryn intends to play it often with him in the upcoming months. </p>
<p>There was the usual piano practice, Mirei reading, and Riku's spelling done amidst the quiet Saturday morning hours at home. Riku did his reading with me, and he and Mirei played quietly and well together at various activities in the living room. Riku showed Mirei how to play one of his games on the iPhone this morning. He's very patient with her and she is a good pupil. It's lovely to see them interact so happily. </p>
<p>Han, Riku's Saturday tutor, arrived at 1 P.M. and got a giant hug from Mirei. He and Riku have a routine of working for a half hour on some aspect of his Chinese language skills, with a fifteen minute break for playing ... still speaking in Chinese, but using the iPod for a game together, or building Lego, etc. </p>
<p>This was the last time I will see Han perhaps, as I am not sure he will still be in Japan and/or available as a tutor in December, and we had a very touching goodbye. Han spent quite a long time telling me how special he feels our family is; how much he enjoys being with such affectionate children, how kind Bryn and Akane have been to him, and how much he enjoyed getting to know me as part of that family group. I was very moved by what he had to say, and do hope I see him again. </p>
<p>The children and I read some of their books together, with Riku joining us for Mirei's "Fancy Nancy", and before we knew it we were into our usual evening/dinner/bath/routine. It all flew by too quickly but the children were very excited that the Easter bunny would be visiting overnight. </p>
<p>Actually, at some point Riku asked me quietly how the Easter bunny got all those candies to the children, and before I could answer he suggested that perhaps the Easter bunny was just made up. He put it in such a way that I had to answer him and so told him that it sure was fun believing that a giant bunny could do such a wonderful thing. So, he knows, and I hope this doesn't mean that he will not be believing in Santa this year. It changes things for them, I know, as I remember that all too clearly myself and with Kelly and Bryn. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane are continuing to clear out drawers and cupboards, so I had some time on Bryn's computer looking at photos, until it was time to get busy wrapping up all the jelly beans, and the tiny chocolate eggs, and the gifts from the Easter bunny. Bryn and I spent quite a long time counting and putting pink and blue bows on the squares of plastic wrap, just as Kelly and I did not that many years ago for Bryn and Caillie ... lovely memories. I hid them about the living room / dining room while Akane and Bryn finished up their sorting job and off we went to bed. I'm sure the children will be awake extra early tomorrow! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/easter_morning_a_week_early.html">Easter Morning... a Week Early</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei was awake especially early today, and Riku was ready to join her in the big Easter egg hunt the minute she came down the stairs and into our room. It was just 6:30, and I was very surprised to find they had already entered the living room and had found a couple of eggs before their parents were downstairs. So, I hid them, Akane and Bryn came down just a few minutes later, and the children were off, dashing from spot to spot. It was lots of fun to see... they obviously remembered all the good spots, so cushions were lifted, curtains pulled aside, every drawer in the room opened, and they were up on tip-toe and down on the floor peeking everywhere. </p>
<p>Mirei spotted a bag with blue ribbon, and knew that was Riku's. The idea was that they would find them all, and then share them at the end. However, <strong>this</strong> particular bag had a candy in it that for some reason appealed to her, so she had a chat with Riku convincing him that she would give him a really good one of hers in exchange. Riku agreed, mission accomplished, and back they went to work until every packet, plus the one big gift, was discovered. </p>
<p>They sat tidying up their found treasures, comparing them, and were given permission to eat one packet each. Chocolate was saved for after lunch. </p>
<p>As the children were inspecting the booty, Bryn was busy making his homemade hashbrowns, Akane scrambled the eggs, bread was sliced and toasted, and a fresh pot of tea and juice was ready for us to enjoy. The hash browns were a hit with all of us; Bryn felt they could have been slightly less well cooked last night, but I thought they were perfect and did they ever hit the spot. Yum! </p>
<p>I have written up today in three segments so on to the next... the temple market. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/03/a_last_visit_to_the_market_at.html">A Last Visit to the Market at the Local Temple</a></h2>
								<p>As soon as we had finished up breakfast, and everyone had done their "morning routine" — dress, teeth, hair brush, and face wash — Akane, the children, and I were on our way to a local temple for the Sunday market. The weather was lovely, and we enjoyed our walk/run/stroll along the river, over the bridge, and through the big gates. It was bustling, and Riku headed right over to the stand where he bought the homemade apple "jam" the last time he was here with his mom and dad. I bought him a jar for a special treat, and we wandered around a bit, but before long the children were ready for some quiet time along the stream. </p>
<p>Riku was anxious to play in the woods, so after I found some little gifts for Amelia and Finn, and bought three more of the lovely handmade postcards I had bought from the same friendly gal the last time, the children and I went off to find a quieter spot. We passed two young girls dressed so beautifully in traditional kimonos, with their hair perfectly done up. They were being photographed as they walked along looking at the various booths. </p>
<p>We also saw a group of men in bright yellow robes carrying a large coffin-like box through the crowds, and were delighted later on as they passed us by, without the box, and insisted that the children join in on the photo that I asked if I could take of them. </p>
<p>How Riku and Mirei enjoyed that quiet time in the woody area, just off the beaten track. We were pretty much on our own and the children got busy working together to build a "castle" out of rocks and twigs. Riku was the builder and Mirei the worker, as she went happily wandering about, finding, or trying to find, exactly the sized piece of wood or stone that Riku requested of her. </p>
<p>Akane stopped by with some snacks for them, and went off on her own to wander a bit more. I took some footage of them running and racing together too, on a long pathway. </p>
<p>Riku was very sweet with his sister, deliberately letting her beat him, and telling her she was a "gold medal winner" when she came puffing up to the finish line. I was so proud of him. </p>
<p>At last it was time to go home, and I promised Riku that we would come back within the next day or two so he could continue on with his castle. </p>
<p>But before leaving, we spotted a wedding party, something I believe I have seen every time I have visited this particular shrine, and I stopped to take some photos. The bride and groom, in a group photo with family, along with the bride's mother, gave us all a big smile as we stood admiring them. </p>
<p>We walked along the river again on the way home, but weren't rushing at all ... stopping at a teeter-totter, where Riku pushed Mirei up and down — it was more like a bench seat — until we felt rain drops. Akane put Mirei in the stroller and dashed ahead of us to try to get some clothes off the line at home, while Riku and I walked along, not minding at all that we were getting a bit wet. </p>
<p>We were rewarded with the sun coming out in just a few minutes, and with a big hello to the principal of Riku's school, who was walking along the footpath under the bridge we were crossing when I spotted him. Riku was delighted, and we had a chat about how good it was that his principal was out walking, getting some exercise, and not sitting at home watching TV. </p>
<p>And now on to the third part of our day: colouring Easter eggs! </p>

								<p>Home for lunch and then it was time for a fun and favoured once-a-year activity ... colouring eggs. I had taken a kit along with me; they had just started putting out the Easter goodies two days before I left for Japan, so I lucked out. The children spread paper on the table, and we got right to work, colouring ten Easter eggs. Riku and Mirei delighted in the colours and took their time dipping and re-dipping; they all turned out beautifully! </p>
<p>Mirei got a new hair-do today; she had her hair pulled back on the sides, and looks adorable. She spent a lot of time playing with a doll house that Akane brought down from her bedroom, and what a time she had with the tiny furniture; Akane joined her for a while too. </p>
<p>Later on, Mirei decided I too needed a new look and stood behind me on the sofa pushing and combing my hair this way and that. I listened to Riku practicing his piano above us, realizing that I have just two more days with the children before winging my way back to San Francisco. I hope the next few months fly by as quickly as this one did! </p>
