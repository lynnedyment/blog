								<h2>A Last Visit to the Market at the Local Temple</h2>
								<p>As soon as we had finished up breakfast, and everyone had done their "morning routine" — dress, teeth, hair brush, and face wash — Akane, the children, and I were on our way to a local temple for the Sunday market. The weather was lovely, and we enjoyed our walk/run/stroll along the river, over the bridge, and through the big gates. It was bustling, and Riku headed right over to the stand where he bought the homemade apple "jam" the last time he was here with his mom and dad. I bought him a jar for a special treat, and we wandered around a bit, but before long the children were ready for some quiet time along the stream. </p>
<p>Riku was anxious to play in the woods, so after I found some little gifts for Amelia and Finn, and bought three more of the lovely handmade postcards I had bought from the same friendly gal the last time, the children and I went off to find a quieter spot. We passed two young girls dressed so beautifully in traditional kimonos, with their hair perfectly done up. They were being photographed as they walked along looking at the various booths. </p>
<p>We also saw a group of men in bright yellow robes carrying a large coffin-like box through the crowds, and were delighted later on as they passed us by, without the box, and insisted that the children join in on the photo that I asked if I could take of them. </p>
<p>How Riku and Mirei enjoyed that quiet time in the woody area, just off the beaten track. We were pretty much on our own and the children got busy working together to build a "castle" out of rocks and twigs. Riku was the builder and Mirei the worker, as she went happily wandering about, finding, or trying to find, exactly the sized piece of wood or stone that Riku requested of her. </p>
<p>Akane stopped by with some snacks for them, and went off on her own to wander a bit more. I took some footage of them running and racing together too, on a long pathway. </p>
<p>Riku was very sweet with his sister, deliberately letting her beat him, and telling her she was a "gold medal winner" when she came puffing up to the finish line. I was so proud of him. </p>
<p>At last it was time to go home, and I promised Riku that we would come back within the next day or two so he could continue on with his castle. </p>
<p>But before leaving, we spotted a wedding party, something I believe I have seen every time I have visited this particular shrine, and I stopped to take some photos. The bride and groom, in a group photo with family, along with the bride's mother, gave us all a big smile as we stood admiring them. </p>
<p>We walked along the river again on the way home, but weren't rushing at all ... stopping at a teeter-totter, where Riku pushed Mirei up and down — it was more like a bench seat — until we felt rain drops. Akane put Mirei in the stroller and dashed ahead of us to try to get some clothes off the line at home, while Riku and I walked along, not minding at all that we were getting a bit wet. </p>
<p>We were rewarded with the sun coming out in just a few minutes, and with a big hello to the principal of Riku's school, who was walking along the footpath under the bridge we were crossing when I spotted him. Riku was delighted, and we had a chat about how good it was that his principal was out walking, getting some exercise, and not sitting at home watching TV. </p>
<p>And now on to the third part of our day: colouring Easter eggs! </p>
