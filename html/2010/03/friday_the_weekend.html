								<h2>Friday ... And Riku Gets a Strike!</h2>
								<p>I suggested to Riku this morning that he bring his iPod with his new game into bed with me, rather than sitting at the table in the not-yet-warmed-up dining room. I gave him permission to bring his peeled banana and orange into bed too, a real treat, as eating in a tatami room is generally not allowed. He was very careful, knowing it was a special treat. We have big puffy duvets on the futons, and nothing was messy or crumbly, so there we were, snug as bugs in rugs for the first half hour of our day. Lovely! </p>
<p>I took Mirei to school this morning; we had lots of time to get to the stop, but of course did our usual "run, run, run!", and "stroll, stroll, stroll" for the first two blocks. Then we really did just stroll, as Mirei spotted a tiny sparrow, told me she liked little birds, but not big ones like crows, and proceeded to make up a song. It went along these lines: "tiny bird, in a nest, growed up, left the nest, mommy sad, the bird came back, was little again", and on it went. Very endearing little song it was.</p>
<p>The first thing Mirei does when she gets on the bus, in her favourite seat near the back, is take off her backpack, take off her jacket, and settle in. This morning, Riku had drawn five pages for a "book", making it up from a story we read yesterday called "Three Golden Keys". He ran to the door with it at the last minute, suggesting that we read it on the bus. I snapped a photo of Mirei on the bus that reminds me so much of her Baba, Akane's mother. There are times that Mirei looks very much like her or Auntie Ayako. Bryn and Akane can see it too. </p>
<p>Riku and Akane were watching a Japanese ninja movie from Akane's childhood, when I walked in, so I checked my email and then sat at the table eating my regular egg and toast breakfast with tea. The movie over, Riku sat beside me to draw. Then he read "Starry Messenger" to me, a lovely book that Garry had given him when he was just a little fellow; we all like this book and series very much. </p>
<p>Riku went off to the dentist with Akane for a noontime appointment, then home for lunch, with a thick comic book, which had him laughing out loud so hard that it made the three adults looking up at each other with huge smiles. Bryn said later he envied Riku those huge belly laughs.</p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon flew by. Riku drew a picture of lots of bugs on a letter that he will write to Amelia tomorrow. Next he read half "The Starry Messenger" to me, paying close attention to all the tiny drawings, and then we went up to his room to do some more sorting out. Riku is very clear about which toys he wants and which he doesn't, which makes it much easier to tidy up and make more room. We should all be so decisive! </p>
<p>Bryn and Riku left on the bike at 4:45 for Riku's piano lesson, an hour later today, and I walked to the bowling alley an hour later to meet them. This was a perfect time to go, as it was almost empty. Riku played first and to his utter amazement and delight he got a strike with his first ball! Bryn got one also, a little later on, but it wasn't my day for more than a spare. It was such fun, and I'm so glad we managed to get there again. </p>
<p>Home for a yummy pasta dinner that Akane cooked up, a half-hour TV show for the children, while they finished off the last of the caramel corn, and tuck-in just after 8 for Riku. Bryn cleared my camera card and I went through the last few days of photos and wrote emails on his computer until bedtime, after my glass of OJ with Japanese vodka. </p>
<p>Only four more sleeps until I leave Japan. </p>
