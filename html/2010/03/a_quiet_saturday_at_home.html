								<h2>A Quiet Saturday at Home</h2>
								<p>Riku dashed out of bed this morning, and came back with his new and big Japanese comic book, to read in the warmth of the bed until the living room warmed up. Mirei slept in today but once she was up and the two of them had their breakfasts they played with the Blockus game we had found in Riku's room a few days ago. They made up their own rules, with Riku overseeing it all, and then Riku and Akane had a real game. He's good at it, and Bryn intends to play it often with him in the upcoming months. </p>
<p>There was the usual piano practice, Mirei reading, and Riku's spelling done amidst the quiet Saturday morning hours at home. Riku did his reading with me, and he and Mirei played quietly and well together at various activities in the living room. Riku showed Mirei how to play one of his games on the iPhone this morning. He's very patient with her and she is a good pupil. It's lovely to see them interact so happily. </p>
<p>Han, Riku's Saturday tutor, arrived at 1 P.M. and got a giant hug from Mirei. He and Riku have a routine of working for a half hour on some aspect of his Chinese language skills, with a fifteen minute break for playing ... still speaking in Chinese, but using the iPod for a game together, or building Lego, etc. </p>
<p>This was the last time I will see Han perhaps, as I am not sure he will still be in Japan and/or available as a tutor in December, and we had a very touching goodbye. Han spent quite a long time telling me how special he feels our family is; how much he enjoys being with such affectionate children, how kind Bryn and Akane have been to him, and how much he enjoyed getting to know me as part of that family group. I was very moved by what he had to say, and do hope I see him again. </p>
<p>The children and I read some of their books together, with Riku joining us for Mirei's "Fancy Nancy", and before we knew it we were into our usual evening/dinner/bath/routine. It all flew by too quickly but the children were very excited that the Easter bunny would be visiting overnight. </p>
<p>Actually, at some point Riku asked me quietly how the Easter bunny got all those candies to the children, and before I could answer he suggested that perhaps the Easter bunny was just made up. He put it in such a way that I had to answer him and so told him that it sure was fun believing that a giant bunny could do such a wonderful thing. So, he knows, and I hope this doesn't mean that he will not be believing in Santa this year. It changes things for them, I know, as I remember that all too clearly myself and with Kelly and Bryn. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane are continuing to clear out drawers and cupboards, so I had some time on Bryn's computer looking at photos, until it was time to get busy wrapping up all the jelly beans, and the tiny chocolate eggs, and the gifts from the Easter bunny. Bryn and I spent quite a long time counting and putting pink and blue bows on the squares of plastic wrap, just as Kelly and I did not that many years ago for Bryn and Caillie ... lovely memories. I hid them about the living room / dining room while Akane and Bryn finished up their sorting job and off we went to bed. I'm sure the children will be awake extra early tomorrow! </p>
