								<h2>Bowling!</h2>
								<p>Fridays are often bowling nights for Bryn and Riku; they go at the end of Riku's week at school, and after the piano lesson that follows immediately. Mirei has her lesson after Riku, so there is a nice little period of time that a game of bowling fills perfectly. </p>
<p>It has been a while since I bowled, and I was looking forward to this first game ever with Riku. I walked over to the bowling lanes, with careful instructions from Riku that morning as to exactly how I should get there ("Turn right after you cross the bridge, not left to go to school." and "Meet us inside or outside, but the bowling is upstairs and you can show me the way when we get there."... I was to have checked it out while waiting for them). It was a busy place, with fifty-four(!) lanes, but early enough that there were lots of young bowlers there, and very few smokers. </p>
<p>We had a great time; Riku bowled a spare quite quickly, and had a surprisingly thoughtful ball, as often it looked as though it was going to hit the gutter, and then would change its mind and head towards the centre for him. </p>
<p>Next to us was a  large group of very young teens, perhaps fourteen or fifteen, and how those girls fussed over Riku! They clapped when he hit any pins at all, gave him big smiles, tried to engage him in conversation, although he was a bit shy with them, and kept talking to each other about him ... it was obvious that he was the centre of their attentions! </p>
<p>It was fun to watch Riku carefully lining up the pins with ball in hand, letting that ball go, often down on one knee, and then watching it, sometimes leaning one way or another to help it along its way. He just enjoyed the game and didn't worry at all about how well he or any of us were doing. I suppose that will change eventually, so for now we'll just enjoy rolling those balls down the lane! </p>
<p>Bryn won the game of course, then I followed, with Riku not far behind me. We hope to bowl both Fridays left to us here, and later that evening, I told Riku we could bowl in San Francisco with him too. Doug would certainly enjoy a game a week, and we can bowl with Auntie Susan, and the children too. </p>
<p>On the bridge walking home, we passed three girls who also fussed over Riku; when I asked him what they had said to him he replied, "They think I'm cute; they always say that!" </p>
<p>Nice relaxed Friday night at home. Dinner while watching TV is a treat for the children, and for us too. Mirei also wrote her thank-you note for the "bug and track" that Susan sent for her, so it can be mailed tomorrow. </p>
<p>Busy fun end to the week!</p>
