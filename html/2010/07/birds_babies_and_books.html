								<h2>Pancakes, Puzzles, and Painting</h2>
								<p>It's Sunday, so we decided to make Grandpa pancakes. Mirei helped with each stage of the mixing up as she always does if there is anything to be cooked! I took lots of photos of her doing each step, and she reminded me to "take a picture, Nana!" if I had overlooked a photo op'! The pancakes were delicious: Mirei was delighted with the heart-shaped one I made for her, and served Doug the homemade applesauce he was putting on his first couple today. </p>
<p>After her "morning routine" Mirei went upstairs and brought down several of the Ravensburger puzzles that all of the grandchildren have done over the years. She, like the others, is very good at them, and often finds a particular piece we are looking for before me. We worked one of the three together but it was more fun to watch her face as she scouted out the right piece for the right spot. </p>
<p>Mirei realized she had painted only one picture since she came to San Francisco, so out came the paints. She painted a glorious happy pair of flowers and was especially pleased when she found out that I had a little bit of white paint and she could indeed have <strong>pink</strong>! She quite enjoyed mixing up her own shade of her favourite colour for the rest of that painting, and the next one of a tall house too. </p>
<p>We had talked about making cookies as a "surprise for Daddy", so we got right to that after the painting was done. I took a kazillion photos of Mirei baking with me again; she loved using the mixer, turning it on and off between adding the dry ingredients, as well as pushing the batter down away from the sides of our very full bowl. I didn't have the right candy bar for these wonderful cookies of Judi's, so I cut up some Turtles and Mirei was very happy scooping them up and adding them to the batter. She could hardly wait to lick the batters!</p>
<p>The cookies were made of oatmeal, chocolate chips, Turtles, and dried cherries; some oatmeal and bits and pieces of the chopped Turtles had fallen to the floor during the measuring, so Mirei got busy with the broom and dustpan and did a great job sweeping it all up! What a girl she is; she even said "You shouldn't have to do everything, Nana, so I will help you." ... and she really did. She even volunteered to wash the paint holders; of course she loved holding the sprayer and did a great job managing that too, and I was only too happy to dry them, as she suggested. </p>
<p>We had expected Bryn and Riku home earlier in the afternoon and thought we might have an outing to a playground with him. However, by the time we had tidied up they still weren't home, so Mirei suggested a trike ride on the sidewalk. Mirei hasn't had a lot of practice at steering at all, and she went all the way up two long blocks figuring that out very well, well enough that she could steer into and out of a small space at the town house complex to "scare" me. </p>
<p>We were on our way up from the opposite side of the sidewalk when Bryn and Riku pulled into the garage. I'm not sure if Mirei was happier to see her Dad, or he her! Lots of big hugs and many kisses, while Riku told me about some of his adventures in Sacramento. I heard more over dinner time with the children; Riku loved being in the pool with his dad, Amelia, and Finn, he loved the high flying swings (Bryn sent photos to us), and Mirei got to tell Riku about the birds and the new playground too. Bryn said next summer Mirei would go with them too. I'm thinking that a really inexpensive summer holiday treat would be three days in a hotel with a pool, or even four days! Just think of the money we would save on gas, and we could just hang out all day long in the pool. </p>
