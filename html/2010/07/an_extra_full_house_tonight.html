								<h2>An Extra Full House Tonight</h2>
								<p>Well, our long anticipated day has arrived, as Riku is tucked snugly into bed next to his sister, and Akane and Bryn are out for dinner with friends. Doug is at a movie, the last of his comedy film festival. I am about to head off to bed, but shall recap my day first.</p>
<p>I awakened at 6:10 this morning, no doubt with all the things I hoped to do before that plane arrived. I accomplished quite a bit, still having time to sit with Mirei while we ate our big fruit plates! I always ask Mirei to choose three fruits, from a choice of maybe four or five, and today, after my assuming that she wanted "candy watermelon" (we both think it's "as good as candy!" ), she told me she had changed her mind and wanted an apple instead. The past few days Mirei has been telling me that she should choose her own food, and it should be her idea, etc. This also meant that she decided she wanted one and a half oranges today, leaving me with only a half orange! </p>
<p>A nice little extra for Mirei today was having two homemade jams to choose from, a grape jelly from Auntie Beth, and strawberry jam from Auntie Susan. She liked them both and went back and forth between the two with a spoon for each jar and a knife to spread it on neatly. They are both delicious and two of my very favourites. I indulged too. </p>
<p>I managed to get a few extras done this morning... made up a banana bread for Akane; Mirei didn't want to help because she really can't stand the smell of them. And I formed a loaf of cheese bread, and put together another small potato salad, to get us through the weekend. I had cooked up the potatoes and eggs last night. I got laundry in, though didn't do the vacuuming I had hoped to, but I have learned not to sweat the small stuff. </p>
<p>So, off we went to the airport to meet Akane and Riku's flight, which landed twenty minutes early. We were there exactly a half hour after that, all eagerly checking out the monitor to see them from the very first minute we could. And two hours later we were still sitting there! We had no idea what to think: if they had missed the flight, we knew Akane would have been in touch with Bryn; if they got through customs miraculously fast, it didn't seem likely that Akane would have given up on us and left five minutes later. And yet where could they be? The flight stayed on the board for the longest time, giving us hope that for whatever reason people were still being processed from that flight. </p>
<p>We were all hungry, and Mirei was incredibly good-natured about it all, although once she spotted a woman with a big of chips that was all that was on her mind. Never mind the grapes or cucumber I had with me; she wanted chips. She had been so good that I told her as a special treat she could have a bag. This was more than two and a half hours after we had arrived there, and so the two of us went off to buy some. I had asked at the United counter about their whereabouts and was told they had been on the flight. Another phone call by the gal let us know that they were in immigration ... so whew! No driving back home without them, wondering how we missed them, where they were, etc. </p>
<p>What a thrill it was to see Riku just blasting along the hallway to greet us after we were coming back from the chips run! We just missed getting there in time to see them come out the doors we had been sitting in front of for <strong>so</strong>, so no first photo as I love to catch, and I missed Riku jumping into Doug's arms when they spotted each other.  I did get such a big long enthusiastic hug myself, and then another and another. Mirei got a big hug too, and it was just wonderful to see them. Akane had been questioned for some time about having not legally given up her Green Card when she left the country, something neither she nor I knew was the law. What an awful way to end an eleven hour flight! They were both hungry and tired and ready to get to the house. </p>
<p>Akane wanted a burrito, so we stopped on 24th Street for a pick-up, and Riku asked for "real mac' and cheese" which I made the minute we got upstairs. The house was just so busy after that: Riku kept rediscovering things he remembered, or things he wanted to do with me ... a new maze book to check out, with Mirei and I both trying to spot creatures hiding here and there along the mazes. He and Mirei did some serious gardening too, pulling lots of weeds and raking well too! </p>
<p>Akane's friend Greg came by and he and Akane left for a few hours; the children got to try on the motorcycle helmets when he first came in, and Riku told me later he saw his mom on the motorcycle when they left. I know Mirei would have liked to have seen that too. </p>
<p>Out came the doctor's kit, and the musical instruments, and I noticed that Riku also tidied up what he considers to be "his" desk, as Mirei had her books scattered here and there on top. Doug bought a fresh new Bristol board for it two days ago, and while they were playing very happily together after a very long bubbly bath, I put the new board down for him. Little things make Riku happy, and this was one of them for sure. </p>
<p>They both liked my version of udon noodle soup, with lots of veggies, and I sat with them while they ate and chatted. It was bedtime far too soon after eating! Mirei usually has a full hour before tuck-in time, and I shall try to get back on schedule when our afternoons are not cut quite so short. </p>
<p>Mirei was quite teary today, a combination of having to share me, having to share with Riku, and having Riku rebuff her ideas of fun things for him to do with her! There will be a little adjustment period I'm sure, as Riku too expects me to be able to listen to him for a long time, and this doesn't make Mirei happy at all. </p>
<p>Bryn suggested we try letting the children sleep together; Riku is anticipating Mirei kicking him, but neither Bryn nor I find this with her, so we shall see how it goes. My biggest worry is that one or the other will waken the other far too early, but we talked about not doing so, and my fingers are crossed that this works for them. I read to Mirei in bed as always, and stayed with her until she was asleep, about fifteen minutes tonight. I came out to find Riku sitting on the sofa quietly reading — his parents had gone out just as I was reading to Mirei — perfectly content, and ready for bed without a story himself. </p>
<p>Mirei was almost a full hour late going to bed, and Riku a half hour past his bedtime, so I'm hoping for a good long sleep for both of them.</p>
