								<h2>Errands, "Our Playground", and a New Book Too!</h2>
								<p>We had tentative plans to go to a movie today, either with Susan and the children or on our own, but the morning was a busy one with both children involved with either drawing or reading. It seemed we had plenty to do to keep busy, plus Riku had homework as well. He's quite keen to get some done every day, and said he was worried about not finishing it. So he did two full pages today of math and Japanese writing, and filled in some titles of books for his reading list. Mirei read to me from her current book, but today we started in the middle and went forward from there. By the time she gets through most of it, she is not so keen to keep at it, so this seemed like a good plan. </p>
<p>Mirei drew me two pictures today and now signs them to me as well, each and every time without my asking. She was cross with me at one point, though, and went to an older picture she had drawn for me that was hanging on the fridge, crossed off "Nana" and printed in "Mommy". Later she apologized to me and said she would never do that again. </p>
<p>After a big lunch of mac' and cheese with carrots, spinach, and their one piece of candy from Riku's trip yesterday, the three of us headed off to run some errands, followed by playground time. </p>
<p>They are both always happy to go to Rainbow with me, to sample the cheese, and to help pick out the carrots. It was a quick trip for more strawberries and yogurt, and then we set off for Costco for a few items there. Mirei had memorized our list three days ago and she had it down pat: oranges, dates for date squares, and skin cream "for Daddy". They like the samples there too, and had yogurt, and some chicken and fish too. </p>
<p>When Riku first came he called the playground on 23rd Street, just a half dozen blocks from their old house, "my playground", but in this past week it has become "ours", including Mirei in it now. I was willing to go to a new playground Bryn went to with Mirei two weeks ago, but Riku insisted he was okay going to this closer one. It worked out beautifully, as it gave us more time there, and a nice grassy space where Riku and I could use the badminton set. Mirei started off playing with him, but soon found some children her own age, and spent the two-plus hours we were there mostly with them. I was surprised to see her with a lime paleta (Mexican Popsicle) at one point; one of the girls' dads had bought them all one, and Mirei was delighted. She shared the end of it with Riku too. </p>
<p>Riku and I had such fun whacking the bird back and forth to each other. Riku is getting so good at hitting and serving, and was thrilled to bits with it all. The running around was good for me too, and it was mostly how Riku wanted to spend his time. An older boy stood around watching until I asked if he wanted to play for a while, so they did. He was a nice boy and told us his name when he left, and said he hoped he could play again one day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mirei was asked by two slightly older girls if she wanted them to paint her arm. They were so cute and had come prepared with their face-painting kit. They took turns putting on Mirei's favourite pink and purple colours with some white added in as well. </p>
<p>When I gave the fifteen-minute warning before leaving, they got busy on the roundabout with some other children, mostly doing the running to keep it moving. Riku dashed off on his own to climb to the top of the dome rope structure, and was up there faster than I imagined he could. One last spin down the twister pole for both children and we were on our way home for baths and dinner time. </p>
<p>The children ate a great dinner: bean, cheese, and rice burritos, a custard cup full of corn, and cucumbers. Riku had an orange for dessert and Mirei chose to have "a bowl of custard with just one strawberry on top." They both were busy with books during dinner; we don't always do this, but it was just the three of us at the table and I was happy to oblige. </p>
<p>Riku discovered a book we had ordered for him, not hidden away well enough. While I was tucking in Mirei he spotted it on the counter and when I joined him in the kitchen he asked if we could read it. He loved the title "The Sound of Colors... a Journey of the Imagination. How he enjoyed the half of it we read ... to be continued in the morning. Many thanks to Brooke Speirs who discovered this book, and who encouraged me to buy it. </p>
<p>Mirei was asleep at 7:35 and Riku before 8 P.M. I couldn't resist taking a photo of them when I went in to check on them later in the evening. </p>
