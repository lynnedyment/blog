								<h2>A Busy Saturday</h2>
								<p>I was awake very early this morning and had done some emailing before the children woke up at 6:30 on the nose, as seems to be usual now. Both children wanted me to go into their bed for a long snuggle; Riku suggested telling a complicated ghost story, taking turns one by one, and with only a few sentences each. We had done this in Japan a year ago and both children remembered that it was a ghost story then too. I'm sure this was why Riku suggested it again.  I'm amazed at how "into" this Mirei gets, even lowering her voice when speaking like a ghost. Riku had insisted we stick to a scary storyline as once in a while Mirei tends to veer off into a lighter topic! </p>
<p>Riku was chatting with Bryn last night about having breakfast at "Jim's Restaurant" today. It's a family favourite of theirs and they have been going since Riku was just a little guy. He really likes their hash browns. Me too! However, plans had been made with Sean and his fianc√©e Jen' to meet at "Just for You", a less greasy spoon for sure. Surprisingly, Riku loves the beignets there, although Mirei does not, much to my surprise, as she has much more of a sweet tooth than Riku. So off they went at 7:50 for their first meal out of the day. </p>
<p>Once home again, Riku did some Japanese homework with Akane, while Mirei joined me upstairs. She watched "Pingu" while I read the paper and then we snuggled in closer, covered in a blanket ... the fog is low this morning. Riku joined us when he was finished, and we talked about "wee" Bryn not liking the big walrus, just like Riku.</p>
<p>I watched while writing letters to Bryn, who is at a camp as a junior counselor, and to Tanner, a five-year-old grandson of my cousin's. He loves getting mail and writes back too! </p>
<p>When it was time for a new activity I suggested the children go outside with some stink bombs and "poppers", little pellets that go "bang" with a satisfying sounds when they are thrown hard on the bricks. Doug was outside with them and helped Mirei figure out exactly how to throw it. She caught on fast and was very happy with the results! We must try to get to Chinatown for more. </p>
<p> I just realized that Mirei has not drawn a picture for the past two mornings, the first days she has missed since she arrived. Mornings are different with her brother here for sure.  </p>
<p>After a mid-morning snack and with no sign of the heavy fog lifting, we finally decided to go to the playground nearest to their "old" house. It was chilly leaving here, and I had jackets for all of us with me. However, within minutes of arriving, the sun came out and Riku and I were shedding our second layers. </p>
<p>We were there for an hour and a half and it was such a great day for them both. Neither of them had ever gone down the twisty pole that is in most playgrounds around here. I never knew how to help place them on it, and neither of them showed much interest in sliding down anyway. However, today Mirei did it first, while I helped her with her long legs and hand position, and after she had done it successfully three or more times, Riku decided to give it a shot. He wanted me to spot him, but he actually caught on very quickly. This was not a surprise to me, as two- and three-year-olds go down this pole! </p>
<p>The next thing I knew, Riku was up at the very top of the roped dome structure. Again, many younger children do this, and Amelia was likely doing this when she was three or four, but it always made me very nervous and I counted myself lucky to have grandchildren who didn't insist on doing it. I never could decide how I could help them out if they needed help, as it went too high for me too! Once Mirei saw Riku up at the top, there was nothing to stop her, and I got a few photos of the two of them on that climb and reaching the top together. There will be no keeping them on the ground after this. </p>
<p>We had thought we had to be home for 2:30, as the plan was to go out for a very early dinner. However, plans changed, and so we had another hour and a half here. Riku read two chapters in his book to me, and we found "Are You My Mother?" hiding behind a cushion on the sofa. So, Mirei and Bryn had their reading session as well over nice and early as well.</p>
<p>The children and I played a round of "Go Fish", and a mysterious card game that only Riku knows the rules to; thankfully, they favoured Mirei as she always seemed to have the "strongest" card, so that made me happy. She was yawning away and I don't think she would have been a happy loser today. Mirei is in a "not fair!" period and that wouldn't have seemed fair at all if I had all the cards. </p>
<p>Just before 4 o'clock they all left to try out a new pizza place that has been getting great reviews. I've had a chronic sinus congestion problem and haven't been able to taste anything in days, so it worked out well as six won't fit in our car. I managed to get some emails written that were in dire need of answering, and continued making a list for our trip to L.A. on Monday. </p>
<p>At Bryn's request I made up a quick and fairly modest sized dinner for them: mushroom risotto, broccoli, and carrots. I read a "Henry and Mudge" book to them after the halfway-through-their-dinner mark, as both children love a story and most especially during dinner time.  It's obvious how much Riku still likes the boy-with-his dog stories he started out reading, as he grins from ear to ear as the story goes along. </p>
<p>Very quick tubs tonight, and with Mirei more tired than usual, Bryn promised Mirei that she could sleep with her mommy all nigh tonight. She was asleep in about ten minutes, and Riku got to have a second story in the front bedroom as his special treat. Despite that, though, the last thing he said before he rolled over to sleep was that he wanted to sleep with Mirei. Riku was also quick to fall asleep ... in less than ten minutes, I think. </p>
<p>Both children seemed more tired than usual today and tonight. I certainly am, as I awoke far too early with my sinus problem at an all time high on the discomfort level. Being able to breathe in any position would have been a nice way to get back to sleep! </p>
