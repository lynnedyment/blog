								<h2>Morning Playground Outing, and a Dinner Date for Mirei and Bryn</h2>
								<p>Mirei slept until 8:15 this morning and walked into the kitchen on her own, wishing Doug and me both a "Good morning!" in a big cheerful voice. What a way to start the day! </p>
<p>After our morning cuddle, Mirei was ready for her fruit plate and drawing time. She is doing such fun pictures right now, using bright primary colours, drawing lots of fun figures, and imaginative flowers. However, she also wants to cut them up into smaller parts now, so I have to dash and get the camera so the whole image is preserved first! </p>
<p>Once Mirei's breakfast was over, she disappeared into the living room to keep Bryn company while he was working. This gave me a chance to clean up the kitchen and sneak in to take a photo of them busy together. </p>
<p>Mirei rode her bike around the garden in the morning and afternoon today, keeping herself amused with a big long stick while riding. I think she was trying to find bugs, and when Riku gets here she will be happy to have him put them in the little bug carrier she had with her on her travels. </p>
<p>It was another gorgeous sunny day, a perfect day to visit the playground up on Potrero Hill. On a hot day this is a great place to be, as it is often windy and cool when the fog is hovering. Today the weather had drawn lots of families there, and Mirei had no trouble at all finding two different playmates for the two and a half hours we spent there. </p>
<p>Home for lunch, a walk to the mailbox with Grandpa again, did her spelling with Bryn ... ten words a day I believe, and read two extra pages in "Are You My Mother?" to me. How well she reads and she hasn't balked at doing it either, that or the spelling. </p>
<p>We had talked about making a cherry pie yesterday and Mirei reminded me about this today. Mirei made the cherries all on her own, making dozens of little balls from pink PlayDoh, while I made the crust. This has been a favourite activity of Mirei's for two plus years now, and they are looking very professional at this point. We got to practice in Japan in March too. It sliced beautifully and Mirei was very proud of it. I plan to make a real cherry pie with her soon. </p>
<p>During the day, Mirei often brought up all the women we met yesterday. She played the little arm game that Victoria taught her, asked me to tell her everyone's names again and then told me what they looked like ...  "Grace had pink lipstick and Victoria had red lipstick but Angie ... hmmm, I don't think Angie had lipstick on, or maybe Ellen too." Mirei thought we could visit them again tomorrow, but we will have to hold off until at least next week. </p>
<p>At 4:45 Bryn and Mirei left for dinner with the Doering/Ellis crew; I had made up two loaves of semolina bread this afternoon to rise, and sent one of the baked loaves over for them. I even got a half batch of cheese bread baked while Mirei was chatting on her "cell phone" while tending to her baby. </p>
<p>After they left I got busy and finally got the second bed made up in the front bedroom, put all of Mirei's clothes in their proper places, put away several books that Mirei had looked at this morning, and wrote lots of emails. There was some toes-up time too, with a cup of tea and the morning paper before Bryn dropped Mirei off at home for us at 8:40. Bryn and Susan were off to a concert tonight. </p>
<p>Mirei had a great time with them all, and was yawning away during her second Caillou story. She was fast asleep in less than ten minutes, and I left her room at 9:05 P.M. </p>
