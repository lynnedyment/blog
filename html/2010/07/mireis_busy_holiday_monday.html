								<h2>Mirei's Busy Holiday Monday</h2>
								<p>What a little social butterfly is our Mirei! This morning she left for a very early breakfast with her daddy and Bern, leaving the house at 7:30, at "Just For You", a favourite Potrero Hill cafe. I was told she had a great time, getting to know Bern again, being complimented on her in-house drawing, and doing her best to keep up her part of the morning conversation. When she got home she told me she had porridge with apples and cinnamon and that it was <strong>very</strong> good. Bryn overheard her, and could not believe it! She had an egg and toast, but made the oatmeal story very convincing! </p>
<p>An 11 o'clock playdate was in the offing, so she stopped in at home for some time with a drum, reading with Grandpa, and even helped me make up some porridge with apple and cinnamon for a pre-playdate top up! </p>
<p>I made good use of the time and did a whirlwind cleaning on this first floor, baked up a loaf of ww bread, mixed up a half batch of a ww cracked wheat bread, put together a big tabbouleh salad, and even sat down with a hot cup of tea and read for a half hour. </p>
<p>Susan and Finn had joined them at the big new playground with Quentin and his parents, and had lunch at their house too, a Mexican meal. Mirei told me that Quentin "looks different now, his face doesn't look the same" .. that was over eight months ago and Quentin is only two now, and that "he kissed me on my cheek and he had tomato on his mouth, but I wiped it off and it was okay." </p>
<p>Bryn and Mirei walked in about 2 P.M., and the rest of the day, until Mirei's tuck in time at 7:15 was packed full of many activities... drumming, baking apple muffins together, and making "pizza" with PlayDoh. We finished watching "Dumbo" which we had started this morning and ate "healthy snacks" while doing so... lots of discussion here about how some snacks really can be good for us!. </p>
<p>Oh, and we did our daily pink balloon tossing, a new activity since Doug's birthday on Saturday... three days in a row, and it varies. Sometimes we have to hit it up and then across to each other, or sit on the floor and toss it from over our heads to each other. Mirei makes up the rules each time and we play at least two versions of it too. </p>
<p>For dinner, Mirei asked for the "pasta that Grandpa had last night, but with some of that green stuff on it that I really like... right, pesto! and crunchy carrots (meaning not steamed) and broccoli." Dessert was a small dish of ice cream and a quarter of a muffin, which she really liked. We all played "opposites" together, with Mirei coming up with lots of good words for us to guess too. She's good at it! </p>
<p>Towards the end of her big dinner, Mirei asked if she could play with the buttons. I was amazed that she remembered about the button box, but was so pleased that she did. It was something that I loved doing as a child at my grandmother's, and I have many of those old buttons in my collection. Mirei even noticed the box was different! She asked for "many many containers" so that she could sort them into her favourites while still being able to see them all easily. And, of course, I took a photo of those favourites. </p>
<p>Mirei was sound asleep at 7:30 tonight, after we finished up the end of one of the "Mouse Tale" books. She liked it a lot and we decided we would go to the library soon to get more of them. </p>
