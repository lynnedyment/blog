								<h2>Lunch with "The Ladies" and a Hummingbird Visit</h2>
								<p>It was a gorgeous hot sunny day here today, and if we had stayed in the city, we would have been at Ocean Beach or Baker Beach for certain. However, we had a date in Cupertino with Mirei's newfound friends: Ellen, Victoria, and Grace. We stopped in at Ellen's first as usual, where she had a couple of little gifts for Mirei: a red stamp pad, letters of the alphabet to go with it, and a book of "Dora, the Explorer" stickers. Mirei had already given Ellen our gift, a fresh-from-the-oven loaf of cheese bread, which Mirei had helped mix the dough for yesterday. Ellen was thrilled to bits with it, as she has mentioned several times how good it sounded, and after tasting a piece immediately, pronounced it absolutely delicious. Mirei was very pleased. </p>
<p>Our group sadly did not include Angie today, but there were four new women there for Mirei to meet, including Kimmie, Ellen's lovely older daughter, whom I have known for many years. </p>
<p>Angelina, Victoria's mother, is visiting for a month from Columbia, and two old friends of "the group", Theresa and Phyllis, joined us too. We were a lively group of ten at one point, as Kim's boyfriend, Ian, joined us as well. It was interesting to see three of the females become quite flirty when this good looking young man arrived: Angelina, Grace, and Mirei! Their eyes lit up and Mirei made sure she gave him lots of attention and hugs too, something that Angelina and Grace couldn't manage as easily as fast-moving Miss Dyment! </p>
<p>Victoria kindly gave Mirei several coins for the little purse she was carrying, as well as a tiny carved horse, and Grace had bought a three-inch hand-crafted Hawaiian doll in a case for her, saying it just reminded her of Mirei when she spotted it. </p>
<p>Mirei delighted everyone with her warm hugs and kisses when meeting again or being introduced for the first time ... and Kimmie certainly won <strong>her</strong> heart when she took her off to a little market to buy her a treat <strong>and</strong> spent time with her trying to teach her to blow bubbles with the gum she bought. </p>
<p>At the end of our three-hour "date", Mirei went around hugging everyone again, and being especially attentive with Grace. </p>
<p>Mirei and I sang most of the way there and back, about an hour and a half of singing! We stopped in at a new playground too, one at Douglass Street above Noe Valley. We stayed for about forty-five minutes; it was very quiet so Mirei had the climbing structures all to herself. She is more fond of the swings now than ever before, and for the first time I twisted her around and around and let her twirl fast: she loved it! </p>
<p>Doug and Bryn went to a concert in Berkeley tonight, so we had another quiet evening together. While we were having our dinner, with the back French door open for the breeze, a hummingbird flew in! Mirei was initially frightened of it; I guess it looked like a giant bug at first glance, but we moved her to the other side of the table, and sat there for the next half hour or more watching it hover and then sit on the ledge, surely frightened him/herself! </p>
<p>Mirei was a tired girl ... lots of excitement and company today, and a hot day too. She was asleep at 7:35 tonight, and when I went back into the kitchen the hummer was gone. I did get some footage of it, though, as well as some still shots. </p>
<p>Jody called as I was finishing up the kitchen, so I took my tea into the living room, put my feet up and heard about her successful five-day trip to NYC. </p>
<p>Mirei is down to no fingers to count, as tomorrow her mom and brother arrive; she is one very excited little girl! </p>
