								<h2><a href="/2010/07/morning_playground_outing_and.html">Morning Playground Outing, and a Dinner Date for Mirei and Bryn</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei slept until 8:15 this morning and walked into the kitchen on her own, wishing Doug and me both a "Good morning!" in a big cheerful voice. What a way to start the day! </p>
<p>After our morning cuddle, Mirei was ready for her fruit plate and drawing time. She is doing such fun pictures right now, using bright primary colours, drawing lots of fun figures, and imaginative flowers. However, she also wants to cut them up into smaller parts now, so I have to dash and get the camera so the whole image is preserved first! </p>
<p>Once Mirei's breakfast was over, she disappeared into the living room to keep Bryn company while he was working. This gave me a chance to clean up the kitchen and sneak in to take a photo of them busy together. </p>
<p>Mirei rode her bike around the garden in the morning and afternoon today, keeping herself amused with a big long stick while riding. I think she was trying to find bugs, and when Riku gets here she will be happy to have him put them in the little bug carrier she had with her on her travels. </p>
<p>It was another gorgeous sunny day, a perfect day to visit the playground up on Potrero Hill. On a hot day this is a great place to be, as it is often windy and cool when the fog is hovering. Today the weather had drawn lots of families there, and Mirei had no trouble at all finding two different playmates for the two and a half hours we spent there. </p>
<p>Home for lunch, a walk to the mailbox with Grandpa again, did her spelling with Bryn ... ten words a day I believe, and read two extra pages in "Are You My Mother?" to me. How well she reads and she hasn't balked at doing it either, that or the spelling. </p>
<p>We had talked about making a cherry pie yesterday and Mirei reminded me about this today. Mirei made the cherries all on her own, making dozens of little balls from pink PlayDoh, while I made the crust. This has been a favourite activity of Mirei's for two plus years now, and they are looking very professional at this point. We got to practice in Japan in March too. It sliced beautifully and Mirei was very proud of it. I plan to make a real cherry pie with her soon. </p>
<p>During the day, Mirei often brought up all the women we met yesterday. She played the little arm game that Victoria taught her, asked me to tell her everyone's names again and then told me what they looked like ...  "Grace had pink lipstick and Victoria had red lipstick but Angie ... hmmm, I don't think Angie had lipstick on, or maybe Ellen too." Mirei thought we could visit them again tomorrow, but we will have to hold off until at least next week. </p>
<p>At 4:45 Bryn and Mirei left for dinner with the Doering/Ellis crew; I had made up two loaves of semolina bread this afternoon to rise, and sent one of the baked loaves over for them. I even got a half batch of cheese bread baked while Mirei was chatting on her "cell phone" while tending to her baby. </p>
<p>After they left I got busy and finally got the second bed made up in the front bedroom, put all of Mirei's clothes in their proper places, put away several books that Mirei had looked at this morning, and wrote lots of emails. There was some toes-up time too, with a cup of tea and the morning paper before Bryn dropped Mirei off at home for us at 8:40. Bryn and Susan were off to a concert tonight. </p>
<p>Mirei had a great time with them all, and was yawning away during her second Caillou story. She was fast asleep in less than ten minutes, and I left her room at 9:05 P.M. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/a_puttering_about_kind_of_day.html">A Puttering About Kind of Day</a></h2>
								<p>We had a low-key day here today, with a long leisurely breakfast to start it off. Mirei is in her "flowers and long skinny women/girls" drawing phase, and it is sweet to sit and watch as she decides what to draw and then go for it, with no hesitation at all. She knows whether there will be a sun or a moon in any particular drawing, and what colour triangular skirt each of the girls will be wearing. Today it was a sparkling purple one, very much like one that she owns herself. </p>
<p>We worked on a wooden ABC puzzle too, over breakfast; Mirei discovered the stash in the hallway upstairs, and we took turns finding the right letter and thinking of other words that start with the same one. Mirei gets much amusement out of making up ludicrous words and I must confess I encourage her as she works to come up with anything to make me laugh! </p>
<p>Doug and I had a Costco run to do, and of course Mirei came with us. She was quite disappointed that there wasn't much food around ... the free samples she obviously remembers from trips there in the past. There was a little cup of a fruit drink and she picked out the bits of white chocolate in a dry fruit trail mix. </p>
<p>Home at 12:30 for her very favourite cheese tortellini from Costco; I took several packages with me to Japan so that she could share it with Riku too. We sat at the table while she started making a birthday card for Doug for tomorrow  and finished off her morning drawing too. Mirei now likes to cut out her drawings so today she said to me "Nana, take a picture of this drawing so I can cut it up." Oh, she knows me well! Even though I am taking photos of them all, I still don't like the idea of her cutting them all. I won't have a nice portfolio of her early works, the way I do of Riku's.  </p>
<p>While Mirei did her spelling and reading with Bryn I formed a loaf of cheese bread and set it to rise, baking it later in the day. Bryn liked it a lot, saying it didn't even need butter, but I noticed that Doug prefers it with. I have one more loaf of that ready to bake when we need it. I still haven't bought a loaf of bread since coming back from our trip to Twin Falls and B.C. </p>
<p>Not much later, Doug had some errands to run, Bryn planned his first visit to Gold's Gym, with a bargain $10 monthly fee with a Groupon I found online. So I quickly packed up a snack pack and we got dropped off at a nice playground off Mariposa on the Hill. At the time we were there Mirei was the "big kid" in a group of four children, and she generously shared her buckets, shovels, and rakes with the little ones. She did wander over to the bigger kids' area a while later, though, and went on the swing, down the slides, up the towers, and in the sandy area on that side, watching all the bigger boys clambering up and down and teasing each other. She's a people watcher, like her Nana, for sure! </p>
<p>Mirei scraped the top of one of her toes just as Bryn arrived, and she cried really hard. It's not often we hear Mirei cry, and when we do we know she really hurts. She fell against a concrete divider today and scraped her knee but only stopped to rub it and then carried on. Bryn promised her a bath would make it all better, so in she went as soon as we got home. He was right, and she showed me how it was okay minutes after getting into the water. </p>
<p>I baked talapia for dinner tonight for her, as well as tiny new potatoes and succotash; what a big meal Mirei ate! Doug had told me they were large pieces of fish, but she ate every tiny scrap of it, before moving on to the corn and lima beans, feeding me the few small pieces of red pepper she decided I should have. Last were the potatoes, and she ate most of those, saving room for ice cream for dessert.</p>
<p>There is a cheesecake baking in the oven, and as soon as it's out, I shall be heading for bed. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/dougs_birthday_and_a_picnic_in.html">Doug's Birthday and a Picnic in the Park</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei slept for thirteen hours and twenty minutes last night! I slept with her, which is a rare event, and she awakened about 4 A.M. with a pain in her leg. She was quite upset and was crying hard, but was back to sleep after some cuddling time. Bryn was driving friends to the airport at 4:45 or I would have given in to her request to see her Daddy. </p>
<p>All was fine this morning, and she asked me to cuddle with her in the bed. We did so, read a story, and played with the animals, again not something we tend to do much in the mornings. Mirei is always happy to sit and have her fruit plate after snuggling for a bit, but today was a sweet change from our usual routine. </p>
<p>There were several "Happy Birthday" phone calls for Doug this morning, and Mirei got to talk with Auntie Gail during one of them.</p>
<p>She and Bryn left at 11:45 for a picnic at "Mother's Meadow"; friends of Bryn's and Susan's were visiting from Denmark and had arranged this playdate for old friends and colleagues. Susan called, inviting Doug and me along, so at 2:30 we joined them. </p>
<p>What a perfect picnic day it was! The sun was shining, the air was warm and the park was so crowded Doug had trouble parking. Bryn had to leave right away for a meeting downtown, so we got to see Amelia, Finn, and Mirei running about playing with various children gathered there, not all of them from the reunion group. Amelia was delighted when she got to play baseball with tall, gorgeous blonde-as-her Maxx, Finn and Mirei played ball with two other younger children, and there was lots of running about up and down the various slides and climbing structures. Finn and Doug had a game of frisbee tossing too, and I caught one moment on camera where it looked like they weren't sure just where that frisbeen had gone! </p>
<p>We stayed on until 4 P.M., chatting with Susan and Kevin until we really had to leave to pick up a few groceries for Doug's birthday dinner tonight. </p>
<p>Once home, Mirei played happily in the tub, washing off the day's dust and shampooing her baby's hair, while I made up a "meaty" tomato sauce for our penne pasta, with a salad to go along with it. Mirei had time to finish up Doug's birthday card too, and proudly presented it to him. </p>
<p>Bryn and Mirei hung up lots of pink balloons along the edge of the French doors in the kitchen area, and we were all set. Mirei doesn't eat much salad in Japan but was just great at eating the small bowl that Bryn said to give her. What a co-operative little girl she is, as she wasn't sure about it, but ate every bite of it anyway ... plus the kidney beans in the bottom of the bowl. </p>
<p>Doug opened his gifts from Susan and Kevin ... books by, and a reading to hear Bill Bryson speak in October,  a book of movie coupons from Bryn and Akane for <strong>lots</strong> of movies in the following year, and my gift to him was a pass to a local comedic film festival a little later this month. </p>
<p>Mirei was very happy to help Doug blow out the candles on his cheesecake, and sang "Happy Birthday" with much gusto too! </p>
<p>Doug and Bryn left at 6:30 for a movie; Mirei and I were sitting at the table chatting while she finished off a little more of her dinner, when she started to cry about her leg hurting again. It sounds like "growing pains" to me, as Bryn had them too, and she asked to go right to bed. I got her ready quickly, and placed two warm "bed buddies" on her left leg while reading her two stories. I think they helped as she settled down very quickly and told me she would be fine in the morning. Good thing as there is another picnic going on! </p>
<p>Mirei was asleep at 7:30 tonight and then it was time to tackle the kitchen clean-up. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/little_moments.html">Little Moments</a></h2>
								<p>Pancakes: When Kelly and Bryn were living at home we made pancakes often, using our favourite recipe made with yogurt substituted for almost half the milk, at some point switching to vanilla yogurt. For whatever reason, I haven't made them nearly often enough for Riku and Mirei, so we're going to change that this summer, and make Sundays pancake days. Mirei is my very willing little baking helper and can scoop up and level off that flour, crack and separate the eggs, and mix up a storm like the experts! </p>
<p>Eggs: They're a favourite breakfast food for both Riku and Mirei and usually they have them every other day, in one form or another, with oatmeal on the in-between days. Mirei likes to decide how they will be cooked. "What is scrambled? Oh yes, when the yellow and white are mixed together." or "Fried? What is fried? Oh yes, a dippy egg." Today for the first time she slid her own egg into the frying pan, and checked twice, lifting the lid carefully, to see if it was "just right!". The egg was served today, along with toast and "bacon" as her brunchy meal before going on to a... </p>
<p>Picnic! Yes, Mirei went to a second picnic in a row today, once more with her dad, and joining up with Auntie Susan, Kevin, Amelia, and Finn and other friends of theirs. Mirei was all primed to go, and once we had the right top on (we decided she had better wear a sleeveless top) kept calling to Bryn "Let's go Daddy! I'm all ready!" There will be many many more picnics this summer for certain. </p>
<p>Drawing: Red letter day today! Mirei drew lots of flowers, and a house beside some giant flowers, but tonight she decided to draw a man and a woman getting married (we had watched a Japanese movie called "The Cat Returns" which had a subplot of a wedding) <strong>and</strong> she drew bodies on them both, rather than stick figures for the trunk, arms, and legs. She seems to have bypassed the nipple, belly button phase though as her people are always dressed. </p>
<p>Spelling: Sometime after I left Japan in March, Bryn started "spelling homework" with Mirei. She is always keen to do what Riku does and so reads each day and does her spelling list with no fuss at all. He has a standard list... a, the, on, she, he, yes, no, you, I, and to. While sitting in the car with me the other day we wrote out "boo, coo, moo, loo, zoo" and so now I get to add those to the list when she finishes off with Bryn's. Yesterday Bryn explained the difference between too and to to her as well, and now she has that down pat. It's lots of fun listening to her rhyme them off, sometimes using a singsong voice, sometimes being perfectly silly and deliberately misspelling them just to hear Bryn protest, I'm sure, but always getting them right. I think she's ready to move on. </p>
<p>Little bits... tonight I videotaped Mirei and Doug using a fake language, something I started with Riku when he was Mirei's age. It is such fun to watch and hear her doing this, as she can keep it up for the longest time, sounding perfectly serious and involved with the pretend dialogue with lots of animation involved too! She and I walked several blocks home from the playground the day she arrived chatting away in ourspeak! </p>
<p>Happy 4th! Fireworks and noisemakers are going off as I type this! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/mireis_busy_holiday_monday.html">Mirei's Busy Holiday Monday</a></h2>
								<p>What a little social butterfly is our Mirei! This morning she left for a very early breakfast with her daddy and Bern, leaving the house at 7:30, at "Just For You", a favourite Potrero Hill cafe. I was told she had a great time, getting to know Bern again, being complimented on her in-house drawing, and doing her best to keep up her part of the morning conversation. When she got home she told me she had porridge with apples and cinnamon and that it was <strong>very</strong> good. Bryn overheard her, and could not believe it! She had an egg and toast, but made the oatmeal story very convincing! </p>
<p>An 11 o'clock playdate was in the offing, so she stopped in at home for some time with a drum, reading with Grandpa, and even helped me make up some porridge with apple and cinnamon for a pre-playdate top up! </p>
<p>I made good use of the time and did a whirlwind cleaning on this first floor, baked up a loaf of ww bread, mixed up a half batch of a ww cracked wheat bread, put together a big tabbouleh salad, and even sat down with a hot cup of tea and read for a half hour. </p>
<p>Susan and Finn had joined them at the big new playground with Quentin and his parents, and had lunch at their house too, a Mexican meal. Mirei told me that Quentin "looks different now, his face doesn't look the same" .. that was over eight months ago and Quentin is only two now, and that "he kissed me on my cheek and he had tomato on his mouth, but I wiped it off and it was okay." </p>
<p>Bryn and Mirei walked in about 2 P.M., and the rest of the day, until Mirei's tuck in time at 7:15 was packed full of many activities... drumming, baking apple muffins together, and making "pizza" with PlayDoh. We finished watching "Dumbo" which we had started this morning and ate "healthy snacks" while doing so... lots of discussion here about how some snacks really can be good for us!. </p>
<p>Oh, and we did our daily pink balloon tossing, a new activity since Doug's birthday on Saturday... three days in a row, and it varies. Sometimes we have to hit it up and then across to each other, or sit on the floor and toss it from over our heads to each other. Mirei makes up the rules each time and we play at least two versions of it too. </p>
<p>For dinner, Mirei asked for the "pasta that Grandpa had last night, but with some of that green stuff on it that I really like... right, pesto! and crunchy carrots (meaning not steamed) and broccoli." Dessert was a small dish of ice cream and a quarter of a muffin, which she really liked. We all played "opposites" together, with Mirei coming up with lots of good words for us to guess too. She's good at it! </p>
<p>Towards the end of her big dinner, Mirei asked if she could play with the buttons. I was amazed that she remembered about the button box, but was so pleased that she did. It was something that I loved doing as a child at my grandmother's, and I have many of those old buttons in my collection. Mirei even noticed the box was different! She asked for "many many containers" so that she could sort them into her favourites while still being able to see them all easily. And, of course, I took a photo of those favourites. </p>
<p>Mirei was sound asleep at 7:30 tonight, after we finished up the end of one of the "Mouse Tale" books. She liked it a lot and we decided we would go to the library soon to get more of them. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/mireis_first_but_not_last_badm.html">Mirei's First, But Not Last, BADM Day Today</a></h2>
								<p>After Mirei's always cheerful "Good morning!" today the first thing she asked was whether we were still going to the Bay Area Discovery Museum. Certainly this is the spot that Mirei most often talks about when I am with her in Japan or on Skype with her from here to there. So, today was the day! </p>
<p>Bryn left early for work today, at 6:45 and I thought he had left before that. Somehow Mirei discovered him sitting at the bottom of the inside steps so she put on her shoes to join him. I think she asked him if she could go with him, and when Bryn came home about 6:15 Mirei re-enacted the entire conversation she had had with him! I wish I had taped it. </p>
<p>We spent the morning at home as I hoped the day would warm up a bit before we left. Mirei was busy as always doing another girl/flower/house picture... a different one today as the petals of the flower were individually decorated. This was done while she ate her fruit bowl, and <strong>two</strong> boiled eggs, one right after the other, along with toast. An hour later she ate one of Doug's orange cream yogurts; she is obviously in a growth spurt! </p>
<p>Garry called through on Skype too, so finally Mirei and Freija got to see each other and show each other their dolls, and their drawings too. Freija loves to hear new songs and Mirei sang the Totoro song to her, which Freija also knows. There is a nine hour time difference between them in Sweden and us, so it was great to have connected today and we hope to do so again many times while Mirei is here, and when Riku comes too.</p>
<p>Doug decided to go with us to the museum, so after packing up a  lunch... another feature that Mirei likes about this adventure is sitting at outside on the deck there having a picnic... we headed off late in the morning. As we approached the bridge Mirei came out with "Hey! There's the Golden Gate Bridge!". The BADM is almost right under it, so a few minutes later there we were. </p>
<p>It was a much cooler day than usual, cooler in Marin than in the city which was very unusual, but it was fine for our lunch and then we headed indoors. Mirei did a little painting, but it was crowded so she moved on to the clay table, until a little boy reached over and took something right out of her hands. It seemed a good time to head back outside for all the usual activities there... checking out the cave with all the sea stars and anemones cemented into the walls and the ceiling, looking for hidden treasure at the boat wreck (having some pennies in my pockets adds much to this activity!), clambering in and out of the boat for a much shorter time than usual, and finally climbing the hill to ring the bell at the very top of it. </p>
<p>Coming down from there is a birds nest to sit on, some frogs to rub so they sound like they're croaking, and a spider web to balance on. The most fun of all though is the twig maze/house that all the children love to run around and hide in, and be found, with loud squeals. Grandpa did a great job at pretending to be found, and at finding an easy to spot all-in-bright-pink girl too!</p>
<p>We went into the craft room next where Mirei glued and taped together a fun hanging ornament, made with a cup, two paper plates, some bright ribbon, and crepe paper. Doug managed to fix it so that it held together for display. Before we left that area Mirei built a train for some wooden animals out of blocks. </p>
<p>And last, but not least, was a visit to the tots area. Mirei is just barely under the height limit so this will be her last year to go to this special and always loved spot. There are water beds with lily pads, costumes, mirrors, and another spot with a not-too-tall two story climbing platform, complete with a tunnel and a lookout. Mirei and a playmate called Andrea quickly became pals and until names were exchanged the little one would call out "Friend, where are you?" They had such fun together and were reluctant to have it all come to a close. </p>
<p>We sang songs on the way there and back home again, with me keeping Mirei company in the back seat. I was afraid she would be falling asleep, but she was fine, although ate all the extra goodies in the lunch bag she hadn't finished earlier. She is eating lots, and even told me she wanted tortellini for her dinner "with that green stuff again" aka pesto. </p>
<p>We stopped in at the library and Mirei had a little time pulling books out to look at them herself. "Fish is Fish" is home with us, as well as the picture book of "Baby Beluga" which we have been singing. Another song she has learned is "You Are My Sunshine" and she has the first verse down pat. Mirei often walks around the house singing, or sings to herself when sitting on the floor playing with her babies. </p>
<p>Tub time for Mirei; she asked me to get my camera and take a photo of her doing "swimming, swimming, in the swimming pool... " which I did, and she had a long tub at her request. Bryn came in while she was finishing up her dinner, which was lovely as I thought he might get home after she was asleep, which was at 7:30 tonight. </p>
<p>What a lovely day this was! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/apple_picking_day_and_the.html">Apple-Picking Day and Franklin Square Playground</a></h2>
								<p>Each night at tuck-in time Mirei always likes to remind me what plans we have for the next day. Last night she asked me if we were going to pick apples, and I assured her that we would indeed. That made her very happy, and this morning that was the first question of the day; I guess she's checking to make sure I haven't forgotten. </p>
<p>We went out for a little walk later this morning, stopping to mail a package for Doug on our way to run an errand. It was breezier than I hoped it would be so I ruled out our Ocean Beach afternoon. </p>
<p>Our neighbour Ralph was outside and we stopped to chat to him; Mirei is such a sociable little girl and is happy to chat away with someone she considers she knows. Later when we were going out in the car, Doug was talking with him while I locked up, and Mirei joined them, asking Ralph where his glasses were! She realized that he wasn't wearing them and of course he was amazed that she had noticed such a thing. He told Doug she was a detective in the making!</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the morning in the house. That seems to suit us all well, especially after a busy day out the day before. So, we puttered about, having a nice lazy morning. Bryn was home for part of it, so he joined in some of the fun. Mirei does have a way of entertaining us all for sure! I did a little video recording twice during this time, as she was singing merrily away.</p>
<p>I pulled the big container of plastic blocks out  early, as Mirei enjoyed building with them yesterday. She sat quietly on her own in the living room, putting together a two-house village, asking me not to knock it down as she will play with it more "later".  While picking up all the blocks together we pulled out the wooden beads from the box, and I set her up at the table with a long thick threaded needle. She made a very nice necklace for herself in just a few minutes and modeled it for me too. </p>
<p>Since she was still in a construction mode I got out a set of open plastic cubes, and they kept Mirei very busy while I made her second breakfast and tidied up the kitchen. She did get down to help me load the dishwasher, though, as she takes great pride in knowing where things go now, and is careful with the glassware especially. </p>
<p>After lunch, Doug, Mirei, and I drove to the other side of the city to pick apples from a FreeCycler's garden. I responded to this posting a few days ago and was delighted when I heard back that we could come by any time we liked with bags and a small step-stool. Doug picked Mirei up for some ripe pickings and she got to climb up on the step-stool as well. She loved it as I knew she would, and now we are making plans for making applesauce, plus at least one apple pie baking session too. </p>
<p>The sun was out, and Doug had errands to run, so he dropped Mirei and me off at Franklin Square, a playground that Mirei enjoyed so much before the move to Japan, and last fall when she visited. Today she really lucked out, as she met a great "friend" not long after we got there, and he was very energetic. Mirei was determined to keep up and did so; she did not want to leave at 4:30, but she had said she was hungry so we had to get home. His dad told me that they live very close to Mirei's "old house" on 23rd Street so we are hoping that we might run into them again. </p>
<p>Bryn was here when we got home, so that was great. Mirei got to tell him lots of stories, had a snack, and enjoyed a long tub time with three of her plastic "kitchen" bowls and pans, plus eight or more small balls ... and two spoons too!  </p>
<p>Bryn had dinner with us tonight, but it wasn't quite enough time for Mirei! First Grandpa left and she wanted him to stay home, so when Bryn left to go out with a friend after that, Mirei cried, asking him to stay home with her. She had asked for extra kisses and hugs from them both so she is obviously wanting more male companionship in the evening!  It didn't take her long to stop crying, especially after we made plans to go out one day and leave Grandpa begging for more hugs and kisses. </p>
<p>Mirei read her book to me tonight, and then I read her the first of "My Everyday Story Book", the one I won in grade one for being the best reader. Mirei enjoyed "Sally's Lost Shoe" as much as I knew she would, and I promised we would read the next story tomorrow. </p>
<p>Just before Mirei nodded off, she rolled over and said to me in a very quiet voice "Nana, we forgot to make the applesauce!" and was asleep two minutes later (at 7:35), after I had assured her that we would make it in the morning, which was actually the plan all along.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/my_little_helper_and_the_23rd.html">My Little Helper and the 23rd Street Playground</a></h2>
								<p>Once again, Mirei and I spent the whole morning at home today, as I had plans to do a big grocery shopping trip today, hoped to get to Costco, and Mirei was looking forward to going to the 23rd Street playground, in her old neighbourhood, She had learned yesterday that the boy in the yellow shirt lives very close to that playground and that is mostly where he plays. </p>
<p>Bryn was home until 10 A.M. today, so Mirei had three of us to entertain. She and Bryn did her reading "homework" first thing this morning, tucked into bed together, once again she helped me make her scrambled egg breakfast: she cracks the eggs perfectly, washes the "goop" off her hands and uses the spatula to push the eggs around in the frying pan until they are "just right." </p>
<p>For the longest time Mirei sat at the table after eating, drawing more flower pictures for me, and signing them to me too. I was tidying out a double cupboard in the kitchen while she was playing with the same plastic blocks as yesterday but when she spotted some cotton batting I was going to throw away, she decided to get busy with glue and tape as well. </p>
<p>Her babies got lots of attention this morning, starting off by tucking in the bunny with a "tissue" blanket in her bedroom, and moving on to the living room, where she had Raggedy Ann and Andy, as well as a puppy, and the same bunny keeping them all company. </p>
<p>We had every intention of making the applesauce today, but we all know how hard it is to fit everything in while tending to little ones! Mirei's babies "cried" a lot and so Mirei was running back and forth from the kitchen, where she was drawing and working with the big plastic blocks again, filling me in each time with what was going on with them.</p>
<p>Mirei and I went off to Rainbow, 20% coupon in hand, on the last day it can be used this week. So the store was very crowded, but Mirei happily sat in the cart so that I could hand her each item I bought and she could twist around and place it carefully in the buggy. She had the grocery list in hand too, and whenever she put an item in the buggy, I showed her where it was on the list, so she could cross it off. What a big helper she was! Mirei also chats to people we pass too, and often says "hello" to them in a nice friendly voice. She makes lots of instant friends this way! </p>
<p>As a special treat we bought some organic ice cream sandwiches, one of Doug's favourite things from his childhood. I promised Mirei that they could each sit down and have one when we got home, while I put the groceries away, and then we would go to the playground. I shouldn't have promised, as there were a lot of groceries to sort through and put away, and it was 4 o'clock before we headed out the door. </p>
<p>I reminded Mirei twice before we got there, that we wouldn't be able to stay long and she went into the funniest monologue about it ... something along the lines of "Oh, how many times do you want to tell me that? Ten? Twenty? Maybe you would like to tell me again at dinner time? Or you could tell me at tuck-in time. How about tomorrow?" This was all said in a voice so much like Riku's that it made me howl, and of course the harder I laughed the more she would add to it. </p>
<p>She was so good about leaving after just one half hour, but she managed to fit in a quick turn at all the things to do there except the rope dome. Mirei had taken a ball along too, so we played catch for a while on the grassed-in area, and a little soccer too. </p>
<p>Home, tub, dinner ... it goes like clockwork, with time for the ever-present drawing too. We read the second story in "The Everyday Storybook" about Ben, the dog who is jealous of the new kitten in the family. Mirei is enjoying these stories very much, and always wants to turn the page before we finish up to see what tomorrow's story will be. Jiggers is coming up next! </p>
<p>Riku and Akane will be here with us one week tonight! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/a_fun_filled_busy_day.html">A Fun-Filled, Busy Day!</a></h2>
								<p>... and at this end of it, I am ready for bed, so I'm going to bullet write this one, as I know it could be, and already is, much wordier than I would like.</p>
<p>• The day started off with a little girl with very cold feet climbing into our bed at 7:40. She didn't say a word, just snuggled in, smiling away at me, and then waited for about five minutes before asking "Is it wake-up time?" When I assured her that it was, she said "Let's get up then!" and off she went, making sure I was right behind her. </p>
<p>• Mirei was busy drawing at the table when I finished my shower, and today made Bryn and me matching orange pictures; the tidier one was mine, though, as she pointed out, saying Daddy was a boy and he wouldn't mind. After finding cotton balls yesterday, she is quite intrigued with the possibilities of more interesting craft work, and spent a long time concentrating on pulling them apart and then carefully taping them to the pictures. They are autographed to us too. </p>
<p>• We played "Go Fish" for the first time in Japan in March, and today we had our first game here, using a lot more cards. Mirei won, and was mighty pleased with herself. She has a big heart though, and each time I got a pair she would say, "Good job, Nana!" </p>
<p>• Mirei discovered a new set of pink and white beads in her "treasure box" this morning and was delighted to be able to get right to work on them. She stopped about ten beads from the end, saying that she would "save it for tomorrow." </p>
<p>•  Babies were a big part of her morning again today, and Raggedy Andy and his friends got lots of attention from a very attentive mommy. </p>
<p>• Applesauce! We meant to make the applesauce yesterday and so promised ourselves last night that today would be the day. Mirei unpacked the apples from the bag and placed them in the sink. Then she sprayed them with the sprayer in the sink (Oh yes, she <strong>loved</strong> doing this!) and then swirled them about with her hands to get rid of any specks on them. I cut and cored; Mirei put them in the pot and added the water. I cooked them on simmer for a long long time, and Mirei asked frequently to see how they looked now. </p>
<p>• At one point during the morning I was tidying up in the living room, and realized that Mirei was singing away to herself, in Japanese, as she strung those pink beads. I went in and sat, recording her singing three different songs. She continued with her project, but would explain to me what the songs meant. I have a suspicion that they weren't correctly translated as they seemed to dwell a lot on babies being left on their own, while the mommy and daddy worked, and/or the mother, daddy, and/or the baby dying too. My my! </p>
<p>• Mirei was a very colourful flapper today! She was very busy at one point during the morning and went into her room and changed completely from tights and a light long sleeved shirt to a short puffy skirt and a tank top. Finding lots of colourful beads to hang around her neck and on her arms, completed this look. After she had posed, and admired herself in many mirrors, Grandpa called her to the computer to have a look at other flappers. This was a huge hit! We may have some of what my mom called "Gypsy Lee" blood in her! </p>
<p>• Mirei ate her usual two breakfasts, and a big lunch too, so I was very surprised at how many snacks she was able to tuck away at Costco in the very short time we were there: a quarter of a ham and cheese sandwich, her own serving plus mine of a seven-cheese tortellini, another of a tri-coloured larger tortelloni, white "chocolate" bits Doug and I donated from our trail mix, and some veggie "chips" without the spicy hummous. </p>
<p>• Oh, I forgot, there was a costume change in there before Costco, from a navy top and dark puffy pants to white puffy pants with tights under them. She did keep the beads, though, and got lots of smiles as we wandered through Costco. </p>
<p>• We spent the last hour of our day out at the Mariposa Street playground we went to a few days ago. I pointed out a girl she might be able to play with, and Mirei said she was bigger, as she was balancing at one end of a teeter totter. I suggested that maybe she could do that too, and a little later on she sauntered over and, sure enough, did it easily; she was mighty proud of herself too! </p>
<p>• The last half hour was spent playing with an older girl from a local camp group. The other girl collected water outside of the toddler area and she and Mirei had such fun playing in the wet sand, and trying hard to make a tall castle. </p>
<p>• Tub time with lots of veggies and fruits tonight as well as many many requests for very specific colours of saucers for the cups she had added earlier ... oh, and a big spoon, but not a ladle, plus a small spoon, but not one of the two I took into her, an even smaller one, and it had to be blue to match the saucer. It took a long time to get her udon noodle soup made!  It is no wonder that I am sleeping <strong>very</strong> well each night.  </p>
<p>• Dinner seemed to last a long time tonight, as Mirei had lots to talk about. We were busy with play phones and if it had been earlier, I would have recorded some of the conversations she was having, not just with me, but lots of imaginary friends, grandmas, and parents too! </p>
<p>• Mirei read to me tonight from " Are You My Mother?" and how I love the many facial expressions and the tones she uses when she reads it. I will video her reading the entire book one day soon.</p>
<p>• We said "Goodnight, see you in the morning." after I read her the story of "Skippy, the Lost Dog". Doug picked up two of the "Angelina Ballerina" books at the library for her tonight, and I promised that I would read those to her tomorrow. Deciding what to hear tonight was a tough decision before bedtime.</p>
<p>• Mirei was sound asleep at 7:35, after having yawned her way through the last few pages of Skippy.</p>
<p>• Doug was at a double feature movie tonight, after doing some volunteer work there first, and Bryn continued on to Susan's and Kevin's after work. Mirei and I had a girl's night alone here and had lots of fun.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/xxx_saturday_a_movie_a_new_pla.html"> Saturday: a Movie, a new Playground, and an Evening with Amelia, Finn, and Max</a></h2>
								<p>Yesterday seemed to disappear in a flash! Bryn was home with us all morning, which made a big difference, as Mirei had three adults around to entertain. Bryn read and sang through the "Baby Beluga" book with her, and she and Doug had more fun with their pretend "foreign language" game. </p>
<p>She and  sat quietly at the table with Mirei drawing two new pictures for me. Riku now is wearing pants in these drawings and has hair too, and Mirei now writes my name and hers on top with a heart in between. I am <strong>so</strong> lucky! </p>
<p>Mirei ate her egg "all by myself" and is practicing using a big grown-up knife to "cut it properly, like this, see Nana."... using the knife in her right hand and her fork facing down on the left. The highlight of breakfast though was Auntie Beth's grape jam. Mirei often mentions grape as a favourite flavour and did she ever like this jam! </p>
<p>Doug had free passes for us to go to see "Chicken Run" this afternoon at 2, as part of the film festival he has a week long pass to, as well as doing some volunteer work for it. So, off we went with a bag full on snacks and money from Bryn for popcorn too. Mirei was the <strong>only</strong> child in the entire theatre and so got lots of attention from the five women volunteers there. One woman in particular, a British woman, seemed to appeal to her especially, as Mirei voluntarily hugged her several times, and made sure she gave her another before we left after the show too. </p>
<p>She also got to meet Ruth Stein, one of our local film critics. When she introduced the movie to us, as part of her festival duties, she pointed to Mirei and said that she knew she was especially going to enjoy it. </p>
<p>I believe there were fewer than a dozen people in the entire theatre, so Doug took Mirei up on stage before the movie, and she got to see the thousands of little holes in the screen where, as she told me later, "because there is a person back there singing and that is where the music comes out!". The theatre was chilly, so Mirei snuggled up on Grandpa's lap, ate, and whispered a few questions to us occasionally. She was quite fascinated with most of it... the poor chickens who were going to get turned into pies, the mean woman, the plane they escaped on, and the mean woman getting her just desserts too. </p>
<p>It was time for some running around, and Doug suggested "Amelia and Finn's playground" near their old house. It was the perfect choice as Mirei had such fun sitting on a platform while Doug rolled her along a track, a long and high swing-time ("high as a bird in the sky, high as a plane in the sky, high as Superman... ") When I said "high as Ultraman!" Mirei informed me that Ultraman doesn't fly. Oops! There is a new piece of equipment there now, a stepped climbing and balancing piece, and even though Mirei was a little nervous at winding her way up to the highest part the first time, she ran over to get Doug so he could see her do it too. </p>
<p>We were there for an hour and a half but still Mirei was so reluctant to leave the little boy she had met and was being so sweet and attentive to. He was almost two but was tiny, and she took such great delight in tending to him, tossing a ball up to him, running to get it back after he tossed it down the slide, and giving him lots of gentle hugs. She kept calling him "sweetie" which his mother found so endearing.. and it was. </p>
<p>I had an hour and fifteen minutes after getting home to get a fast dinner on the table, get cleared up, and head out the door to Susan's and Kevin's for an evening there with the children. Thank goodness Mirei suggested tortellini, as it was fast, and with a simple salad along with it, took no time to get it ready. I sat with Mirei as she finished up her dinner, so had that bit of quiet time with her before leaving. I was not prepared for her bursting into tears as I said goodbye to her though, and it was hard for me to leave her. I know perfectly well that Bryn no doubt had her laughing before the car pulled out of the driveway, but she cries so rarely that it is tough for me to take. </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin were not ready to dash out the door when I got there, so Finn and I played with blocks and a ball in his room while Amelia and Max were in the tub. The "big kids" kept themselves busy after Susan and Kevin left at 7:15, and since Finn was hungry, I heated up some pizza for him and we sat at the table chatting on our own, sharing a bowl of carrots too. </p>
<p>Susan had ordered pizza, salad, and cheesecake for us all, but I had eaten a bowl of tabbouleh at home, so we all had some pizza, shared one piece of cheesecake, and had a nice time just talking at the table about the summer camps that Amelia and Max have attended together. Finn showed me some of the things he had done at his Montessori play group too and told me how they spend their days... no gardening, not too much walking, but playing inside and outside.</p>
<p>While I was clearing up after dinner, the three children got busy making pillows. Amelia had asked if they could use old cloths and pins, so I was very surprised when I discovered there was lots of tape and kleenex tissue used in the process as well! They were all sitting on the big bed though for the longest time, having fun and ending up with very nice soft pillows. Amelia decided that hers was so soft, filled and covered as it was with so very <strong>many</strong> tissues, that she would put hers under her regular pillow so that she could show it to her parents in the morning. </p>
<p>Amelia chose a book for bedtime that I had given her a couple of years ago called "Trust Me Mom". We all snuggled up on the big bed, and they all really liked the story, Finn so much so that he asked if we could read it as his own story in his room. I turned out the light for Amelia and Max at 9:15, and then we did that. After we finished it, but with lots of comments in between too, he reminded me where his night light went, to turn on his sound machine, and then snuggled right up next to me, with his feet between my calves. I slowly extricated myself  bit by bit, as he was yawning away and was asleep within seven minutes I'm sure. I stayed in with him for perhaps fifteen minutes more, making sure he was in a nice deep sleep.</p>
<p>I was sitting in the living room finishing the last page of my book when Doug came in after watching a movie at the festival, and we sat chatting until Susan and Kevin came in at 11:15 from a 40th birthday celebration. They had lots of fun, which was good to hear, as they don't get out together often enough. </p>
<p>Bedtime, after a quick check of emails, just after midnight. Yawn! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/mirei_out_and_about_today.html">Mirei Out and About Today</a></h2>
								<p>This was an unusual day for us, as Mirei had a breakfast date with Mari and Bryn, so set off at 7:45 for breakfast at "Just for You" again, making it two Sundays in a row! Mirei helped me pack up a bag to take along with a sweater, her water bottle, plus her drawing pad, pencils, and some grapes. I expected that they would be back after some time at the playground after they ate, but plans have a way of changing. </p>
<p>All three went to a playground near Susan's, and when Mari had to leave, Bryn and Mirei dropped in to say hello. Finn was off at his swimming lesson, so Amelia and Mirei had some time together to play. I'm sure Mirei was thrilled to bits to be there with all the toys in Amelia's room. </p>
<p>Later Amelia went off for a playdate with another friend, so Susan, Bryn, Mirei, and Finn went to the beach at Pacifica. It was quite foggy here in the city this morning but it is often clear further south of us. Mirei had lots of fun playing with Finn, although when she came in she showed me how she had cut the bottom of her foot a bit when she was climbing on a pointy rock. </p>
<p>They all went off to have Mexican food for lunch; Mirei had a quesadilla as well as good tortilla chips, Bryn reported, with guacamole, and a lime Fresca. I know Finn likes quesadillas too, so it was a perfect spot for their lunch. </p>
<p>I had planned to go to a double feature movie with Doug today, from 11-6ish but knew that after my long day and late evening yesterday I would be snoring away during one or both of the films. So I opted for four hours on my own to get some cooking done. The fridge is packed with food and it was time to get some of it cleared out. </p>
<p>In all I was very productive: changed Mirei's bedding, made a double batch of mushroom risotto, and now have enough in the freezer for seven more single meals, baked up a batch of applesauce muffins, using our homemade applesauce, and then bagged up the rest of it for future muffins and/ cakes. I cleared away lots of dishes while talking to a good friend in Idaho ... gotta love those headphones so that I could move around and still catch up on our lives! I called Neal in Niagara Falls and had a long chat with him too. Made up zucchini pancakes, using a recipe from Tay in Twin Falls, and dinner rolls from a recipe given to me by a casual new friend south of the city. Put together a caprese salad too, using fresh basil from the pot outside the back door.  Oh, and I cleaned out two of the kitchen drawers too, while chatting on the phone, and that was well worth doing... funny how these little things make a difference. </p>
<p>About 3 P.M. Bryn and Mirei came home. Mirei had two drawings in her hand, and gave them to me saying they that were for me! Her dad thought differently as she had told them they were for him when she drew them. It's hard to choose just whom to donate precious art work to apparently. Mirei tries hard to make everyone happy ... and does so.  Once up the stairs, I got both versions of how they had spent their time together. </p>
<p>Mirei occupied herself with her babies, but had asked if we could watch more of the Peter Rabbit DVD that Doug chose for her at the library the other day. I had to have dinner on the table at 5:30 tonight, as Bryn and Doug were going to a concert, so Mirei happily went up the stairs with Grandpa to watch the movie until bath time. </p>
<p>There was time for a fishing game with a magnetic board and rod that Candy and Rick gave to Riku when he was a little guy. Mirei likes it every bit as much as he did. </p>
<p>Quick tub tonight, as dinner was right on time. Everyone enjoyed it; Mirei commented that she remembered the mushroom risotto and liked it, we all liked the veggie pancakes a lot, the rolls were delicious, and of course the adults all liked the caprese. Bryn asked Mirei to have just one small portion of tomatoes, but she objected, saying that she didn't like tomatoes. He urged her to have just one bite and I suggested that she could follow it immediately with some food she did like. Doug and Bryn had left the table just after Mirei leaned over and in a loud whisper said she wouldn't have a bite, but "Shhhhh, it's a secret". Well, she took the bite and them immediately took four more pieces of tomato from the bowl, and polished off six more pieces at the very end of her meal. I think the only food Mirei just does not like is bananas. </p>
<p>Doug and Bryn were off to a concert in Berkeley and left the house at 6 o'clock. Mirei and I sat and finished our dinners, she did a drawing with more bits of cotton batting on it, she read to me in the living room from "Are You My Mother?" and rubbed my back for me too, as all the standing in one spot today had me pretty sore. I somehow never did find time for a hot cuppa with my feet up, and by the time Mirei was tucked into bed and the rest of the kitchen clean and tidy it was too late for tea. I did sit, though, and eat a banana and read through a magazine. </p>
<p>It's early to bed for me tonight, and the emails I should have answered are going to wait for another day. It was a most productive day and now I need to "recharge" as Bryn says! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/baker_beach_and_a_girls_night.html">Baker Beach and A Girl's Night at Home</a></h2>
								<p>I slept until 7:15 this morning, not waking until Mirei crawled in on Doug's side of the bed (he was up already) and lay there quietly until I was aware of her warm body and cold feet. </p>
<p>We had plans to go to the beach today, although the fog hung over Twin Peaks so long that I was sure we wouldn't be able to go. That gave Mirei lots of time to put together all of the puzzles that I have owned since I was babysitting friends' children back in the mid-seventies. They are really sweet board puzzles, with darling drawings of siblings, a mailman, and a policeman, although about four pieces have gone missing. Mirei, to my surprise, was able to do them easily, as she finished up the first one so quickly when I was doing up the dishes. I joined her for the rest of them, and we took turns with one of them with each doing one piece at a time. </p>
<p>Mirei also finished writing her letter to Ellen, with a drawing of lots of flowers (and ants!) on the inside of the card too. We had lunch at home, as the fog was still pretty heavy, and by the time I packed up our "picnic", a snack really, it was nice and sunny over here ... but still not looking promising over town. Mirei really wanted to go, though, and wasn't tempted to go to a local playground as I suggested instead. </p>
<p>Baker Beach it was! We both had to put on our jackets, and Mirei a sweater as well. However, once we were seated on our warm blanket, the sand heated up and she was delighted to sit there making "ice cream" with two pails and a shovel. I had my choice among grape, vanilla, strawberry, coconut, and a mix, but I could not, for some reason, mix coconut and vanilla. </p>
<p>Mirei spotted a red balloon tied with a long ribbon on it, so ran off to get it, having me tie it to her wrist. What a great time she had with it. There wasn't much wind so mostly it bounced along beside her, but also got wrapped around her, so there was much twisting and turning involved too. I took <strong>so</strong> many photos of her! We went for a walk as well, but Mirei was too cold on the wet part of the sand, so after a little incident with a too friendly puppy wanting to play with her, we went back to our blanket. </p>
<p>We had hoped to stop in at the Potrero Hill library on the way home, but it was closed, so no princess books today. Mirei had decided she wanted pizza for dinner, though, so we picked up two small ready-made cornmeal crusts and home we came. Mirei popped right into the tub for a long play with her pots and pans, while I made up the potato salad that I had started in the morning, and got the pizza in the oven too. We had such a good dinner together, just the two of us,since Doug had left for a movie by the time we got home and Bryn was at work in the valley still. She took great delight in being allowed to scooping out her own ice cream for dessert tonight, and I was impressed by the small portion she took and then handed the spoon back to me. </p>
<p>I made my daily cup of tea and sat on the sofa while Mirei did her reading. She was <strong>too</strong> funny, deliberately skipping pages while pretending to just be reading as usual. Her giggles gave her away and I let her get away with it, just raising my eyebrows each time to let her know I was on to her. I did some recording and hope that it turned out well. Such fun! </p>
<p>"Dr. Dyment" got out her kit while I finished up my tea, and checked me out thoroughly ... blood pressure, heart beat, throat, knee reflex, needle, etc. but there was a bonus too ... I got my hair combed at the end of it, and was even handed a mirror so I could check out my new "do(!)" Wow! While I finished up the dinner dishes, Mirei combed her own hair too, checking herself out in the little mirror Susan gave to me for a give-away a few weeks ago. It is the perfect addition to Mirei's doctor kit. </p>
<p>At 6:45 Mirei asked if it was story time yet, and at 7:20 I left a little girl sleeping soundly. I'm off to bed before 11 for the second night in a row.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/potrero_hill_all_day.html">A Day on Potrero Hill</a></h2>
								<p>Doug had three movies to attend today, so we ran off early to do a couple of errands, and then the car was free for him. That left Mirei and I on the hill for the day, and we had no trouble at all filling in the hours.</p>
<p>We had planned last night to make date squares together, and Mirei doesn't forget such things, ever! But first we watched the last segment of a Peter Rabbit DVD that Doug had picked up from the library for her, and it was just delightful. I always join Mirei for the last half of it, after I've showered, as she loves having someone to tell all about it. While eating our fruit plates later in the morning than is usual, Mirei wrote her letter to Victoria, as she had promised yesterday that she would, and then it was time for those squares! </p>
<p>One day I hope to make personal cookbooks for all the children, as I have many many photos of them all baking various goodies. Of course, even with an enthusiastic little helper, this makes the process even longer than it would otherwise, and Mirei makes sure that I remember to take photos of each step! She put the dates in a big pot, after we had both tasted one date each ... and once again Mirei was just fine with trying something new, and liked it too. While they cooked and softened, we mixed up the oatmeal, flour, sugar, and soda mixture, with Mirei doing every single step of it. </p>
<p>Mirei measured out the crumb mixture in half, patted down the base, spread the dates on that, and sprinkled the rest of the crumbs evenly over the top of it all, pressing that down more gently, at my suggestion. </p>
<p>While they were baking, we stopped for lunch. Mirei decided she wanted to help make her grilled cheese sandwich too, so she carefully spread the butter on both slices of bread, and helped me use the cheese plane for the cheddar. This sandwich is a big hit always, and she ate if all up quickly. </p>
<p>I had started gathering the ingredients together to make up a batch of cheese bread dough, and Mirei was fast enough eating her lunch that she was there to do it with me right from the beginning. How she loves sticking her nose right down close to whatever she's making and then telling me how it smells. The oatmeal mixture got a big thumbs up but she wasn't crazy about the yeasty odour. I like it a lot, but perhaps she will get used to it. We'll make lots of bread this summer. </p>
<p>Mirei drew in the living room, flat down on her tummy, while I washed up all the bowls and pans we had used for our cooking. I was ready to sit down with a cup of tea, but Mirei was anxious to get to the playground several blocks away, so off we went. We have a very friendly neighbour just two doors down from us, and he was out when we passed by his house. Mirei ran up to him with a cheery "Hello Ralph!" and he greeted her just as warmly. They have been chatting since she was old enough to say "hi", and today Mirei told him her brother and her mother were coming in just two more days. She told him her mother speaks Japanese and a little bit of English, but when Ralph asked her if she helped her mommy learn more English, she replied that Mommy already did know lots of English already. As we continued down the block, Mirei turned back and called out "Goodbye Uncle Frank! See you soon!" I wrote to Uncle Frank to tell him he was on both our minds today. </p>
<p>The playground was the perfect place to end this afternoon. It was warm and sunny and there was a good group of children there, including lots of little ones that Mirei was very protective of, making sure that they did not get hurt. She and I tossed a ball back and forth, she ran up and down the big and smaller slides, we tossed the ball up and down the big one, and Mirei climbed to the top of the big rope structure, assuring me she was fine and telling another woman it was okay if her little boy pushed it while she was climbing. Mirei is gaining lots of confidence, and worked her way through a narrow rope column at the top too, holding on tightly but placing her feet carefully too. </p>
<p>We left at 4:30, enjoying our walk home, as Mirei always has lots to chat about. We sing sometimes too. Earlier today she had talked to Caillie, Myk', and Auntie Kelly on the phone. Caillie had told her that Myk' was her step-sister and Mirei knows all about mean step-sisters from Cinderella. Now she knows that just some step-sisters are mean. Kelly had sung her the song about lemon drops and gumdrops, so we walked part of the way with our tongues sticking out to catch the "rain".</p>
<p>Tub, dinner, three stories at the table, with a tiny date square as part of her dessert. Mirei said "I <strong>like</strong> date squares and I will make them for my children too!"</p>
<p>Mirei was sound asleep at 7:25 tonight, anticipating her visit to Cupertino tomorrow with not just Ellen, Grace, Angie, and Victoria, but Victoria's mom too ("but what about Victoria's dad?"), and perhaps Angie's daughter as well. Mirei did say on the way home that "Grace is a nice girl and pretty too. She has pretty pink lipstick." Grace is 92 and I know she will be thrilled to hear this comment tomorrow! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/lunch_with_the_ladies_and_a_hu.html">Lunch with "The Ladies" and a Hummingbird Visit</a></h2>
								<p>It was a gorgeous hot sunny day here today, and if we had stayed in the city, we would have been at Ocean Beach or Baker Beach for certain. However, we had a date in Cupertino with Mirei's newfound friends: Ellen, Victoria, and Grace. We stopped in at Ellen's first as usual, where she had a couple of little gifts for Mirei: a red stamp pad, letters of the alphabet to go with it, and a book of "Dora, the Explorer" stickers. Mirei had already given Ellen our gift, a fresh-from-the-oven loaf of cheese bread, which Mirei had helped mix the dough for yesterday. Ellen was thrilled to bits with it, as she has mentioned several times how good it sounded, and after tasting a piece immediately, pronounced it absolutely delicious. Mirei was very pleased. </p>
<p>Our group sadly did not include Angie today, but there were four new women there for Mirei to meet, including Kimmie, Ellen's lovely older daughter, whom I have known for many years. </p>
<p>Angelina, Victoria's mother, is visiting for a month from Columbia, and two old friends of "the group", Theresa and Phyllis, joined us too. We were a lively group of ten at one point, as Kim's boyfriend, Ian, joined us as well. It was interesting to see three of the females become quite flirty when this good looking young man arrived: Angelina, Grace, and Mirei! Their eyes lit up and Mirei made sure she gave him lots of attention and hugs too, something that Angelina and Grace couldn't manage as easily as fast-moving Miss Dyment! </p>
<p>Victoria kindly gave Mirei several coins for the little purse she was carrying, as well as a tiny carved horse, and Grace had bought a three-inch hand-crafted Hawaiian doll in a case for her, saying it just reminded her of Mirei when she spotted it. </p>
<p>Mirei delighted everyone with her warm hugs and kisses when meeting again or being introduced for the first time ... and Kimmie certainly won <strong>her</strong> heart when she took her off to a little market to buy her a treat <strong>and</strong> spent time with her trying to teach her to blow bubbles with the gum she bought. </p>
<p>At the end of our three-hour "date", Mirei went around hugging everyone again, and being especially attentive with Grace. </p>
<p>Mirei and I sang most of the way there and back, about an hour and a half of singing! We stopped in at a new playground too, one at Douglass Street above Noe Valley. We stayed for about forty-five minutes; it was very quiet so Mirei had the climbing structures all to herself. She is more fond of the swings now than ever before, and for the first time I twisted her around and around and let her twirl fast: she loved it! </p>
<p>Doug and Bryn went to a concert in Berkeley tonight, so we had another quiet evening together. While we were having our dinner, with the back French door open for the breeze, a hummingbird flew in! Mirei was initially frightened of it; I guess it looked like a giant bug at first glance, but we moved her to the other side of the table, and sat there for the next half hour or more watching it hover and then sit on the ledge, surely frightened him/herself! </p>
<p>Mirei was a tired girl ... lots of excitement and company today, and a hot day too. She was asleep at 7:35 tonight, and when I went back into the kitchen the hummer was gone. I did get some footage of it, though, as well as some still shots. </p>
<p>Jody called as I was finishing up the kitchen, so I took my tea into the living room, put my feet up and heard about her successful five-day trip to NYC. </p>
<p>Mirei is down to no fingers to count, as tomorrow her mom and brother arrive; she is one very excited little girl! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/an_extra_full_house_tonight.html">An Extra Full House Tonight</a></h2>
								<p>Well, our long anticipated day has arrived, as Riku is tucked snugly into bed next to his sister, and Akane and Bryn are out for dinner with friends. Doug is at a movie, the last of his comedy film festival. I am about to head off to bed, but shall recap my day first.</p>
<p>I awakened at 6:10 this morning, no doubt with all the things I hoped to do before that plane arrived. I accomplished quite a bit, still having time to sit with Mirei while we ate our big fruit plates! I always ask Mirei to choose three fruits, from a choice of maybe four or five, and today, after my assuming that she wanted "candy watermelon" (we both think it's "as good as candy!" ), she told me she had changed her mind and wanted an apple instead. The past few days Mirei has been telling me that she should choose her own food, and it should be her idea, etc. This also meant that she decided she wanted one and a half oranges today, leaving me with only a half orange! </p>
<p>A nice little extra for Mirei today was having two homemade jams to choose from, a grape jelly from Auntie Beth, and strawberry jam from Auntie Susan. She liked them both and went back and forth between the two with a spoon for each jar and a knife to spread it on neatly. They are both delicious and two of my very favourites. I indulged too. </p>
<p>I managed to get a few extras done this morning... made up a banana bread for Akane; Mirei didn't want to help because she really can't stand the smell of them. And I formed a loaf of cheese bread, and put together another small potato salad, to get us through the weekend. I had cooked up the potatoes and eggs last night. I got laundry in, though didn't do the vacuuming I had hoped to, but I have learned not to sweat the small stuff. </p>
<p>So, off we went to the airport to meet Akane and Riku's flight, which landed twenty minutes early. We were there exactly a half hour after that, all eagerly checking out the monitor to see them from the very first minute we could. And two hours later we were still sitting there! We had no idea what to think: if they had missed the flight, we knew Akane would have been in touch with Bryn; if they got through customs miraculously fast, it didn't seem likely that Akane would have given up on us and left five minutes later. And yet where could they be? The flight stayed on the board for the longest time, giving us hope that for whatever reason people were still being processed from that flight. </p>
<p>We were all hungry, and Mirei was incredibly good-natured about it all, although once she spotted a woman with a big of chips that was all that was on her mind. Never mind the grapes or cucumber I had with me; she wanted chips. She had been so good that I told her as a special treat she could have a bag. This was more than two and a half hours after we had arrived there, and so the two of us went off to buy some. I had asked at the United counter about their whereabouts and was told they had been on the flight. Another phone call by the gal let us know that they were in immigration ... so whew! No driving back home without them, wondering how we missed them, where they were, etc. </p>
<p>What a thrill it was to see Riku just blasting along the hallway to greet us after we were coming back from the chips run! We just missed getting there in time to see them come out the doors we had been sitting in front of for <strong>so</strong>, so no first photo as I love to catch, and I missed Riku jumping into Doug's arms when they spotted each other.  I did get such a big long enthusiastic hug myself, and then another and another. Mirei got a big hug too, and it was just wonderful to see them. Akane had been questioned for some time about having not legally given up her Green Card when she left the country, something neither she nor I knew was the law. What an awful way to end an eleven hour flight! They were both hungry and tired and ready to get to the house. </p>
<p>Akane wanted a burrito, so we stopped on 24th Street for a pick-up, and Riku asked for "real mac' and cheese" which I made the minute we got upstairs. The house was just so busy after that: Riku kept rediscovering things he remembered, or things he wanted to do with me ... a new maze book to check out, with Mirei and I both trying to spot creatures hiding here and there along the mazes. He and Mirei did some serious gardening too, pulling lots of weeds and raking well too! </p>
<p>Akane's friend Greg came by and he and Akane left for a few hours; the children got to try on the motorcycle helmets when he first came in, and Riku told me later he saw his mom on the motorcycle when they left. I know Mirei would have liked to have seen that too. </p>
<p>Out came the doctor's kit, and the musical instruments, and I noticed that Riku also tidied up what he considers to be "his" desk, as Mirei had her books scattered here and there on top. Doug bought a fresh new Bristol board for it two days ago, and while they were playing very happily together after a very long bubbly bath, I put the new board down for him. Little things make Riku happy, and this was one of them for sure. </p>
<p>They both liked my version of udon noodle soup, with lots of veggies, and I sat with them while they ate and chatted. It was bedtime far too soon after eating! Mirei usually has a full hour before tuck-in time, and I shall try to get back on schedule when our afternoons are not cut quite so short. </p>
<p>Mirei was quite teary today, a combination of having to share me, having to share with Riku, and having Riku rebuff her ideas of fun things for him to do with her! There will be a little adjustment period I'm sure, as Riku too expects me to be able to listen to him for a long time, and this doesn't make Mirei happy at all. </p>
<p>Bryn suggested we try letting the children sleep together; Riku is anticipating Mirei kicking him, but neither Bryn nor I find this with her, so we shall see how it goes. My biggest worry is that one or the other will waken the other far too early, but we talked about not doing so, and my fingers are crossed that this works for them. I read to Mirei in bed as always, and stayed with her until she was asleep, about fifteen minutes tonight. I came out to find Riku sitting on the sofa quietly reading — his parents had gone out just as I was reading to Mirei — perfectly content, and ready for bed without a story himself. </p>
<p>Mirei was almost a full hour late going to bed, and Riku a half hour past his bedtime, so I'm hoping for a good long sleep for both of them.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/pancakes_playground_and_a_visi.html">Pancakes, Playground, and an Afternoon Visit with Finn</a></h2>
								<p>Riku and Mirei both came up and had a snuggle with me this morning, at 7:15. So lovely to see those bright morning smiles! </p>
<p>The children had their fruit bowls up in our bed while I showered. Chatting later about what they would have for their next course,  they decided we would have pancakes. So downstairs we all went. </p>
<p>Mirei did the dry portion first, expertly measuring out the flour, baking soda, and salt, while Riku took care of the wet ingredients: egg, milk, and vanilla yogurt. He hasn't forgotten how to break an egg properly, and they both stood on chairs and watched as the other did his or her part. The pancakes were delicious, but Riku broke out in an allergic reaction right at the beginning of breakfast. Akane and I are both quite sure it was a reaction to the flour. This happened to him many years ago at a friend's in West Vancouver; I think it happens when he gets the flour on his hands and then on his face. Akane had an allergy tablet for him to take, so the red patches and the terribly itchy eyes and skin stopped within an hour or so. </p>
<p>Finn was due to come over at 1 o'clock today, so the three of us went off to the playground at the top of the hill at Riku's suggestion. It was so quiet there, which was surprising, as it was such a gorgeous morning, warm and sunny, so much so that the children spent quite a bit of time under the climbing structure enjoying the shade. </p>
<p>Two big events today; Riku jumped down from the highest point of the structure today, and did it often enough that I was able to catch him in mid-jump! He'll be delighted when he sees the shot tomorrow. Mirei watched a child slide down the fireman's pole several times and decided she wanted to do that too. She did it, with just the smallest amount of help from me. </p>
<p>Mirei has become very opinionated about what she wants to eat these days. Today she decided it would be pizza for lunch; when I suggested something else, she said "I should be the one who decides Nana, because I have to eat it."! And then she reminded me that we still had one pizza shell left over from a few days ago! This child doesn't forget a thing; she obviously remembered that there were two shells in the package. It was so easy to make and Riku thought it was the best pizza he has had for a long long time, "maybe ever!". Doug was drooling after his boring lunch of the third helping this week of a split pea soup from a packaged mix he had bought some time ago. When he tasted it, he thought it was as good as any we have had from any pizzeria, so I'll be stocking up on these wonderful cornmeal bases. It's fast and easy to add some bottled yummy tomato sauce we have discovered through Tay, some oregano, fresh basil, and Parmesan cheese. I must get in some mozzarella. </p>
<p>Finn arrived at 1:15 or so, and the afternoon went by in a flurry of activities! I could see bedlam reigning if I didn't set some limits, so the rule was that they picked up what they had been playing with before pulling something new out. It worked. Finn told me at his playschool they have to "clean up after myself but I don't mind, I like to." Me too! ... having them do this, I mean. Here's a list of some of their activities: gardening at least four different times, pulled lots of weeds and swept too, cars, plastic blocks and car racing set upstairs, "Captain Hook" Finn, with Mirei and Riku going along with his imagination, complete with sword and shield in hand, snack time twice, punching the ball that Doug uses for a chair, Riku's iPod demo (which left Mirei out for a bit, and she was not a happy girl at this turn of events), and various running-around games that involved lots of noise. They sat and drew together at the end of the visit, so I was able to make dinner and listen to them chat as they worked away with paper, stickers, and markers. </p>
<p>Amelia came in from her horseback riding demonstration, which came at the end of this week-long riding day camp. She and Riku were happy to see each other, and we hope there will be some fun playdates this summer, despite their busy schedules and ours too. </p>
<p>Tub time with more soapy bubbles in the tub, fried veggie rice for dinner, which they both enjoyed and ate up quickly, no dessert for Riku (although this is typical for him), and custard for Mirei and Grandpa too. I tucked Mirei in, and came out to find Bryn home with Riku doing his reading to him. They're working on the next "Captain Underpants" series. </p>
<p>Mirei was asleep by 7:30 and Riku went to bed just after 8 o'clock. I went in to check on him about twenty minutes after saying goodnight, and found the two children closely snuggled up beside one another, with Mirei's arm flung over him. They did very well sleeping together last night so this looks like a working plan for the summer! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/xxx_a_busy_saturday.html">A Busy Saturday</a></h2>
								<p>I was awake very early this morning and had done some emailing before the children woke up at 6:30 on the nose, as seems to be usual now. Both children wanted me to go into their bed for a long snuggle; Riku suggested telling a complicated ghost story, taking turns one by one, and with only a few sentences each. We had done this in Japan a year ago and both children remembered that it was a ghost story then too. I'm sure this was why Riku suggested it again.  I'm amazed at how "into" this Mirei gets, even lowering her voice when speaking like a ghost. Riku had insisted we stick to a scary storyline as once in a while Mirei tends to veer off into a lighter topic! </p>
<p>Riku was chatting with Bryn last night about having breakfast at "Jim's Restaurant" today. It's a family favourite of theirs and they have been going since Riku was just a little guy. He really likes their hash browns. Me too! However, plans had been made with Sean and his fiancée Jen' to meet at "Just for You", a less greasy spoon for sure. Surprisingly, Riku loves the beignets there, although Mirei does not, much to my surprise, as she has much more of a sweet tooth than Riku. So off they went at 7:50 for their first meal out of the day. </p>
<p>Once home again, Riku did some Japanese homework with Akane, while Mirei joined me upstairs. She watched "Pingu" while I read the paper and then we snuggled in closer, covered in a blanket ... the fog is low this morning. Riku joined us when he was finished, and we talked about "wee" Bryn not liking the big walrus, just like Riku.</p>
<p>I watched while writing letters to Bryn, who is at a camp as a junior counselor, and to Tanner, a five-year-old grandson of my cousin's. He loves getting mail and writes back too! </p>
<p>When it was time for a new activity I suggested the children go outside with some stink bombs and "poppers", little pellets that go "bang" with a satisfying sounds when they are thrown hard on the bricks. Doug was outside with them and helped Mirei figure out exactly how to throw it. She caught on fast and was very happy with the results! We must try to get to Chinatown for more. </p>
<p> I just realized that Mirei has not drawn a picture for the past two mornings, the first days she has missed since she arrived. Mornings are different with her brother here for sure.  </p>
<p>After a mid-morning snack and with no sign of the heavy fog lifting, we finally decided to go to the playground nearest to their "old" house. It was chilly leaving here, and I had jackets for all of us with me. However, within minutes of arriving, the sun came out and Riku and I were shedding our second layers. </p>
<p>We were there for an hour and a half and it was such a great day for them both. Neither of them had ever gone down the twisty pole that is in most playgrounds around here. I never knew how to help place them on it, and neither of them showed much interest in sliding down anyway. However, today Mirei did it first, while I helped her with her long legs and hand position, and after she had done it successfully three or more times, Riku decided to give it a shot. He wanted me to spot him, but he actually caught on very quickly. This was not a surprise to me, as two- and three-year-olds go down this pole! </p>
<p>The next thing I knew, Riku was up at the very top of the roped dome structure. Again, many younger children do this, and Amelia was likely doing this when she was three or four, but it always made me very nervous and I counted myself lucky to have grandchildren who didn't insist on doing it. I never could decide how I could help them out if they needed help, as it went too high for me too! Once Mirei saw Riku up at the top, there was nothing to stop her, and I got a few photos of the two of them on that climb and reaching the top together. There will be no keeping them on the ground after this. </p>
<p>We had thought we had to be home for 2:30, as the plan was to go out for a very early dinner. However, plans changed, and so we had another hour and a half here. Riku read two chapters in his book to me, and we found "Are You My Mother?" hiding behind a cushion on the sofa. So, Mirei and Bryn had their reading session as well over nice and early as well.</p>
<p>The children and I played a round of "Go Fish", and a mysterious card game that only Riku knows the rules to; thankfully, they favoured Mirei as she always seemed to have the "strongest" card, so that made me happy. She was yawning away and I don't think she would have been a happy loser today. Mirei is in a "not fair!" period and that wouldn't have seemed fair at all if I had all the cards. </p>
<p>Just before 4 o'clock they all left to try out a new pizza place that has been getting great reviews. I've had a chronic sinus congestion problem and haven't been able to taste anything in days, so it worked out well as six won't fit in our car. I managed to get some emails written that were in dire need of answering, and continued making a list for our trip to L.A. on Monday. </p>
<p>At Bryn's request I made up a quick and fairly modest sized dinner for them: mushroom risotto, broccoli, and carrots. I read a "Henry and Mudge" book to them after the halfway-through-their-dinner mark, as both children love a story and most especially during dinner time.  It's obvious how much Riku still likes the boy-with-his dog stories he started out reading, as he grins from ear to ear as the story goes along. </p>
<p>Very quick tubs tonight, and with Mirei more tired than usual, Bryn promised Mirei that she could sleep with her mommy all nigh tonight. She was asleep in about ten minutes, and Riku got to have a second story in the front bedroom as his special treat. Despite that, though, the last thing he said before he rolled over to sleep was that he wanted to sleep with Mirei. Riku was also quick to fall asleep ... in less than ten minutes, I think. </p>
<p>Both children seemed more tired than usual today and tonight. I certainly am, as I awoke far too early with my sinus problem at an all time high on the discomfort level. Being able to breathe in any position would have been a nice way to get back to sleep! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/socialble_sunday.html">Sociable Sunday and Packing Up!</a></h2>
								<p>Today was a busy, fun, sociable day for the children especially. Riku wanted the entire family to go to "Jim's Diner" in the Mission District for breakfast and today was the day. We went early, leaving about 8:15, and were there early enough to get "our" booth, the big curved one in the front window. The children shared a milkshake, and had their usual egg and hash browns. I can't taste much because of my ongoing sinus problem and am trying not to eat eggs right now, so ordered a double order of hash browns! I ate half of them, and brought the rest home to freeze. My eyes were certainly bigger than my stomach today! </p>
<p>Riku sat and did a double lot of homework with his mom, just to get a good start at it, and Mirei did her reading. They didn't have much time back at home, because they were meeting Soo for brunch at 11 A.M. Riku was not thrilled to be going out to yet another restaurant with another car ride (he is so much like Bryn was at the same age). However, they were back in about two hours and he loved his meal, and I'm sure Soo was delighted to meet up with everyone again. </p>
<p>I left for a quick trip to Rainbow to get some groceries for the trip, so Riku did a little more homework while I was gone. Akane went off on her own to do some shopping while Bryn drove to Palo Alto to pick up his computer for the trip tomorrow. Everyone was on the go today! </p>
<p>I spent most of the day checking my packing list and making piles of all that was going with us. The children kept busy with their own various amusements ... Mirei with her dolls and books, and Riku with his drawings and books.</p>
<p>Mirei entertained me and posed for me as well in her grandfather's pink baseball cap; it suited her to a T. </p>
<p>I had an early dinner ready for them, a long relaxing bath and play time, and their usual bedtimes at 7:30 and 8 P.M. </p>
<p>I was feeling very organized right up until then, with all the laundry done and put away, and the stacks of clothes ready to be packed. My intention was to go to bed at a reasonable hour as well, but the phone rang at 9:30 and it was Patrizia calling from Mexico City! We had so much to catch up on, and of course I can't do so when the children are up and about, so really it was the perfect time. We talked for almost an hour and a half, and it was so good to find out what was going on in their lives there. </p>
<p>Bedtime was later than planned but I may sleep with the children on the long trip to L.A. tomorrow. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/san_francisco_to_la.html">San Francisco to L.A.!</a></h2>
								<p>Busy morning for everyone today. Akane was packing up to leave for Japan, I was putting together all the items from my long list of clothes and snack foods, Bryn organized his small bag and drove Akane to the BART station, and Doug worked on the last set of photos for me before he too got packing and filled the two cold containers for the car. Riku did a last set of homework with his Mom, and Mirei kept herself busy and happy. </p>
<p>We left the house at 10:15 A.M., and headed south. It took us exactly eight hours to arrive in our hotel. The children were wonderful in the car. We sang songs, chatted, pointed out interesting things to each other that we saw from the car windows, and I read some stories to them both, individually and together. </p>
<p>Riku nodded off for two hours, and Mirei held off until after 1 P.M. I think she really enjoyed her captive audience as she certainly kept us entertained and laughing all the way. The children like snacks, and I had packed lots of healthy ones, so at lunch we merely stopped at a Taco Bell for takeaway burritos, which the children really enjoyed. </p>
<p>It was hot outside and we had the AC on the entire time, once we got out of the Bay area. This also meant it was quieter in the car, and so reading and singing was easier too. </p>
<p>I was sitting between the two children, with Riku in a booster, to get him up higher, and Mirei in her regular car seat. I was sure this was going to be a very uncomfortable drive, but I was just fine. </p>
<p>Riku does not enjoy long car trips, and before we go anywhere he always asks how long it will take. I was concerned that he might get car sick or just hate being confined for so long, but other than ask once an hour or so how many hours we still had to go, he was a great little traveller. </p>
<p>We were booked into the same hotel where Bryn and Riku stayed a few years ago. It was perfect, with a swimming pool just down from our room. We had hoped to go swimming that first night but after settling in, but we were all hungry and knew it would be too late for the children once we had eaten. We did promise that we would go swimming in the morning before leaving for Disneyland, and that was fine with them. They were excited about being in a hotel and having us all together in one room. </p>
<p>After checking the menu in our room, Bryn and Doug decided that we would have dinner in the hotel ... a wonderful selection of many dishes, all tasty, which we shared among us all. On the way to the restaurant, Riku made us all laugh with a new walk he has come up with: a very fey model's strut, with his hips and shoulders tight, and tiny mincing steps. He moves his shoulders stiffly while walking and it's hilarious. </p>
<p>At the restaurant, while waiting for the food to arrive, the children kept busy drawing, as they always do. We had a long, slow, and very enjoyable meal.  </p>
<p>The children had some time to read before they got into bed for their nighttime story. Bryn had some work to do, so left to sit in an office space around the corner. Doug joined him too, taking along his book, until the children were asleep. It was a long day, but a very good one from beginning to end. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/pool_times_two_and_disneyland.html">Morning Pool Time, Disneyland, and an Evening Swim Too!</a></h2>
								<p>The minute the children awoke this morning, just before 7 A.M., they asked about going swimming. They were into their suits lickety split. Mirei's was pink, of course, and she had pink goggles too, but decided not to wear them as they were too tight. They had a little fruit first, in their suits, while I got ready. Even though it was the last thing I wanted to do this early, off I went with the children. That water, this early in the day, was <strong>cold</strong>, but of course once we all got in, it was just fine. Bryn joined us about ten minutes later, and it was fun for the children to see him shivering while slowly getting in, reassuring him that it was <strong>warm</strong>. I had forgotten to take my camera along, so have no photos of this early morning swim. </p>
<p>Bryn took both children into the middle of the pool, holding them up one at a time, whereas I stayed near the edge and had the children by the hands. They liked both methods, but after a half hour or so it was breakfast and Disneyland time. I showered the children off quickly, and showered myself once Doug, Bryn, and the children went off to eat breakfast. I wasn't terribly hungry, so had some fruit in the room, but did join them for ten minutes, polishing off Riku's leftover hash browns. </p>
<p>Disneyland is less than half a mile from this hotel, and we walked over with Doug and Bryn taking turns carrying Mirei. We didn't want her tired out before she even got there. We did take a photo of the children with Doug and me outside the castle, and then set off for the rides. </p>
<p>Riku wanted to see "Pirates of the Caribbean" first, although once there Mirei was not interested at all in going on the ride. She was close to tears, as she had a bad experience in Japan with the "up and down ride" at Universal Studios, and there was no interest at all for her in this ride. However, not realizing just what it would be like, she joined us, and it was a mistake. She kept asking if it was over, and I could see that she was not having any fun at all with all the bumps, despite lots of assurance from all of us that she was safe. Mirei certainly takes after me in this regard. The ups and down were fine for me, but they wouldn't have been when I was her age. Once safely out, Mirei had a big cry, of pure relief, I think! We promised there would be no more rides like this.</p>
<p>Thank goodness she agreed, reluctantly, to go on the "It's a Small World" boat ride, as she loved every minute of it. By the time we got out she was ready to do it again, but the line up was very long by that time. She and I went off to see a Princess show and how she loved this. Everyone stood for this event, and Mirei managed to get in the very front, so she could marvel at all the princesses and women in their very fancy and pretty dresses. She joined in with the dance "lesson" given first, and then in the Maypole dance too. </p>
<p>Once the dancing was over, the princesses lined up for photos. Mirei was far more interested at that point, in collecting all the ribbons she could that had been tossed into the crowd. By the time that was done, two of the three princesses had finished, but she quite enjoying meeting Aurora. Doug had joined us after the dancing, and we met up with Bryn and Riku for lunch at a bakery/sandwich shop on Main Street. Bryn ordered sundaes for the children for a special treat. </p>
<p>We all went on the carousel together, and then Mirei and went on twice more. She wasn't interested in going on most of the rides, and I was more than happy to keep her company on the horses.</p>
<p>There were lots of crowds, and the lineups were quite long, but we wandered from spot to spot, seeing whatever interested the children. We were all tuckered out and had had enough of the heat by about 5 o'clock, and ready to leave on our trip to Carlsbad to meet up with Lee, a friend Bryn, Akane, and the children met through his "I Like Japan" website. She visited with them in Kyoto, her first trip to Japan, and I was looking forward to meeting her as well. We stopped to pick up burritos again to eat in the car, and Lee was waiting for us when we arrived at her time-share. It's a lovely room, spacious and airy, with a large bathroom, and two big beds.</p>
<p>The children were anxious to swim, so after chatting a bit with Lee in the room, and snacking on some cheese, crackers, and fruit she had thoughtfully bought for us, down we went to the pool. They had a separate play area with a water slide and hoses too, which Riku loved. Mirei stuck to the pool itself, and it wasn't long before Riku joined us too. The children were just delighted to be in the water, especially with two adults to go back and forth between. Lee stayed long enough to see us out of the water, and we said our goodbyes after arranging to meet for breakfast the next morning. </p>
<p>The children had a quick shower; I read them a story, snuggled together in the same bed, and Doug and Bryn went down to the lobby with their computers while I got them to sleep. Bryn picked me up a large cup of tea from Starbucks, and I got some reading done before heading for bed myself. It felt good knowing we wouldn't be on the move tomorrow, as Legoland is a quick walk across the road from here!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/legoland_and_pool_time.html">Legoland and Pool Time, Twice!</a></h2>
								<p>The children awoke at their usual time of 6:30 this morning, all set to go for a swim in the pool! We convinced them to wait a bit, have a little something to eat, and watch a bit of TV first, just so we could garner some enthusiasm for such an early swim! It's hard to resist their bright faces and enthusiasm, though, so off we went! Mirei looked adorable in her little pink suit, and she was just full of beans, suggesting I "take a picture, Nana!" after checking herself out in the two mirrors in our room. Bryn came along too, and we had such a fun time. I hadn't been all that keen (brrrrrr!), but was so happy to have taken the plunge. </p>
<p>We weren't submerged too long, as we had made arrangements with Lee last night to meet for breakfast at 8:30 in the dining room next door. We all took quick showers and dressed, and made it just in time. Breakfast was delicious: a full buffet with omelets made to order, lots of fresh fruit, yogurt, breads, hash browns, and tea pots with English breakfast tea too. </p>
<p>Lee is lovely and the children were happy to sit and make conversation over breakfast with us all. They enjoyed going back for whatever they felt like trying too, and we all had very good breakfasts. </p>
<p>Legoland is just across the street, literally a ten minute walk to the entry gates, and so the walk there along a lovely green boulevard was perfect. It was overcast today, and even that made the day very pleasant. </p>
<p>The children decided later in the day that Legoland was their favourite over Disneyland. There were no scary rides for Mirei, and she especially enjoyed driving a car on her own, while Riku enjoyed that as well as the fire engine race with his dad, and later with his Grandpa added to the team too. He and Bryn came in second that first time, and then first when Grandpa joined them. Doug said Riku absolutely made it possible for them to win, as he was an ace when it came to pointing the hose directly at the fire and holding it steady too. </p>
<p>I talked Mirei into going on a boat ride with me. She really had to be reassured that there would be no "bumps, or ups and downs" and I am so pleased she trusted me, as we had a great time being captains and sailors. Bryn and Riku were in the boat behind us and Riku too was grinning from ear to ear. </p>
<p>Later on, we watched a fun outdoor play, with a princess, two knights, and a few of the little audience members filling in as combatants. Riku sat on his own up front, and was just howling at all of the silliness. Mirei sat back with Lee and Bryn, watching from that vantage point, and obviously enjoyed it as well. </p>
<p>Bryn took Riku for a quick pizza lunch before going off to do some rides on their own. Lee, Doug, Mirei, and I were ready for a more leisurely lunch, so sat and enjoyed our spot at a big table, and our very friendly waitress, who didn't charge us for the bit of food that Mirei ate from the children's buffet: a half a grilled cheese sandwich and some broccoli and milk. </p>
<p>After lunch, Lee and I had some time to sit with our tea, relax, and get to know each other. We have so much in common, and she and I really hit if off. Bryn was sure we would, and he was right. I feel as though I have made a new friend for sure. </p>
<p>Doug took Mirei off for a bit on his own, and not only did they go down a very long slide together, but they had met up with Bryn and Riku while wandering, and Mirei had her face painted, just like the princess, whom she saw twice, before and after the face decorating. Mirei had a long talk with the princess, and Doug said she was as pleased as could be when she got a big hug from this princess too. Doug said she was the only one he saw who did! </p>
<p>We wandered around a bit more, visiting the Legoland city duplicates, which were wonderfully recreated and such fun for all of us to see. I certainly enjoyed Legoland much more than Disneyland; it was less crowded, so quieter, it was more manageable in size, so it didn't feel quite so overwhelming, and there were more interactive fun things for the children to do. Of course I took lots of photos, and it will be such fun to see them once we are home again. </p>
<p>We stopped in at the store, so the children could choose a gift. This took a while, as there were so many things that qualified as worthy, but in the long run, Mirei chose a pink rubber sword and chest plate, and Riku a wonderful complicated Lego set. </p>
<p>After that the children were anxious to spend more time in the pool, and certainly the adults were ready to head back for some time in the hotel too; the short walk home made this easy to do. </p>
<p>Lee joined us for a little while, and she and Bryn went over some of the details of her trip to Japan when she visited there in the spring. We noshed again on more of the cheese and fruit Lee had left for us last night, and that kept us going until Doug and Bryn left and picked up some take-away burritos for us once more. But that happened after our pool time. </p>
<p>Doug snapped a few photos of Riku in the water slide area, but he was happiest in the pool with Mirei and me. (Bryn had stayed behind to get some work done, for which there was a deadline). </p>
<p>There was a darling little girl named Julia in the pool. She was quite the little swimmer, and since her lovely long brown hair streamed out behind her when she was swimming, Mirei told her she looked like a mermaid. She did, too, and the three children spent their entire time in the pool with her. The children enjoy being in the water so much, that we must make sure that by the end of next summer they are both good little swimmers. Riku and Mirei both wished we were staying another day, and I must admit so did I. </p>
<p>I sat with the children in the hot tub and we chatted with some others there, before heading back to our room for those burritos, some veggies, and a few stories after we had all showered. It was a grand day and we all had such fun. </p>
<p>Tomorrow we leave for the San Diego zoo, and then head home to San Francisco tomorrow evening. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/the_san_diego_zoo.html">The San Diego Zoo</a></h2>
								<p>The children had hoped they could swim this morning, but Bryn and Doug both thought it best just to pack up and leave asap for the zoo. The earlier we can get there, the sooner we can leave on our long trip home this evening. </p>
<p>Bryn had looked on the Internet for a breakfast spot not too far away, and came up with a winner. "Lucky's" it was, a one-man-run diner with Lucky taking the orders, cooking up the food, cutting the pancakes into small bites for the children(!), serving it, urging the children to finish what was on their plates, passing the leftovers over to Grandpa and Dad, cleaning the counters, and taking the cash too. We were impressed for sure, and the food was typical diner breakfast food, but at a much lower price than usual. The children sat drawing at the counter while waiting for their breakfast. </p>
<p>On the way to the zoo, we sang all the songs on our tape, always singing "Baby Beluga" with gusto, and with everyone joining it too. The children love us to sing together, and we do quite well with most of the other songs now, as we have heard them so often. </p>
<p>This zoo was wonderful, my first trip there ever. We tried to go once when Kelly and Bryn were youngsters, but it just poured the entire time we spent in southern L.A. that year ... and it was the year the song "It Never Rains in Southern California" by Albert Hammond, was popular too. I remember oh-so-well singing it all the way down and back in the car. </p>
<p>The children both enjoy carrying a map and plotting out their moves, so Riku suggested we go to the reptile house first. He was very taken with the massive boa constrictor, and weeks later Mirei still remembered, and demonstrated, how they give you such big hugs that they crush you. </p>
<p>We didn't see half the zoo, but we did take our time and enjoy all that we did see. Doug was thrilled to see a huge tank with a massive hippopotamus, up close, very close! It's the best view he has ever had of these massive creatures and the children crowded in to see him move around too. They were quite taken with the large sculpture of a hippo too and waited for their chance to climb on it, and play for as long as we were willing to sit there. </p>
<p>I have a fondness for elephants, and toward the end of our time there, we came to the huge area devoted to twelve elephants, both Asian and African, and all just beautiful. We saw giraffes and condors, and massive tortoises too. It's a grand zoo and I would jump at the chance to go again. </p>
<p>The weather was changing from hot to cool all throughout the day, but that was preferable to the searing heat we might have had. I think we lucked out with the weather on this trip, as only Disneyland was a little hotter than we would have preferred. </p>
<p>Before leaving about 5 P.M. the children got to choose a small toy from the gift shop and they both chose lizards. These proved to be very entertaining for part of the trip home, as Mirei babied hers, when it wasn't battling with Riku's. However, once again, the children proved to be such troopers at sitting in the car for eight plus hours. We stopped once for Mirei to go to the bathroom and twice for gas. </p>
<p>We ate dinner in the car again, to get us home faster, and we had snacks along with us too: shortbread cookies, a bit of fruit, and nibblies ... cheese sticks, a few crackers, and lots of cold water as well. </p>
<p>Mirei entertained us by singing "Up the tall white candlestick went little Mousie Brown", with such flair and emphasis on "But Mother was in town!" that she made us laugh out loud more than once. Riku encouraged us in telling bits of ghost stories, one of his favourite ways to pass the time, although Mirei's bits tended to be very long and detailed and he had to cut her short sometimes. </p>
<p>They had had a busy few days, and not as much sleep as usual, so I fully expected them both to be asleep very soon after starting out. Riku gave in first, about 8 o'clock but Mirei held out until after 9, chattering away to herself and her reptile babies or to us. Finally that little head dropped and she was out like a light, all the way to San Francisco, finally landing in at home at 1 A.M. </p>
<p>I didn't sleep at all, much to my surprise, and Bryn carried the children upstairs and tucked them right into bed together. The children slept right through their move from the car to the bed except for  just a few minutes during the transfer. I got a peek of them snuggled up beside each other before I headed up.</p>
<p>I stayed up to wind down a bit, checking my emails and responding to a couple of them. Bed at 2 A.M. for me with plans for a much earlier to bedtime tonight!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/home_again.html">Home Again and Franklin Square</a></h2>
								<p>Riku was the first one awake this morning, asking his dad's permission to get to work on his new Lego set. By the time I came down he was well entrenched at the kitchen table, with all the various parts in the small plastic food storage containers, and well on his way to having it take shape. Mirei and Bryn slept in longer, and Mirei was fast to join Riku at the table to admire what he had done. He was very patient with her, pointing out how he had to follow the instructions, and letting her help find the pieces. </p>
<p>He worked away at it non-stop and was very proud showing it off to Bryn and his Grandpa; Bryn was amazed at how quickly he finished it and Doug was amazed at how complicated it was, with Riku doing it all on his own, with no help at all except for pulling apart or sticking together some of the tiniest tightest pieces. </p>
<p>For some reason the song "Lollipop", which Bryn had played for the children in Japan in March, came up this morning. Doug put the song on the computer and had both children join him, teaching them how to do the "pop". It was pretty cute to see, and Riku got it down pretty quickly; Mirei was giving it her best shot and got some pointers from her dad later on. </p>
<p>We had a slow easy morning at home, with a long stretched-out breakfast, and lots of down time. Mid-afternoon we decided to go to Franklin Square, a playground very close to us, and the children had a great time playing together and with some of the other children there. Mirei met a darling little girl, and while they played together, the mom and I had a nice chat. Mirei always remembers these children and wonders if she will see them the next time we are there. It always astounds me that almost always she remembers their names too, sometimes weeks later! </p>
<p>We were all quite tired after our long day yesterday and so it was an early night for baths before dinner, and bedtime not that much later. Of course we had time for stories first, although I could tell both children were ready to snuggle in for a good long sleep. </p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, early, Bryn and Riku are off to the State Fair in Sacramento, leaving Mirei home for some quiet alone time here in San Francisco. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/pancakes_puzzles_and_painting.html">Pets, and a Playground!</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn and Riku were up and ready for their two-hour drive to Sacramento about 7:30 this morning. Bryn planned to stop at McDonald's for a rare breakfast as they drove; they will be meeting up with Susan, Kevin, Amelia, and Finn for a long day at the fair. I packed up enough fruit and veggies in a cooler to last Riku for two days, along with a few snacks too for the car trip and in the hotel tonight. Surprisingly, Mirei was fine with letting them go off without her, but I had promised we would have fun here today. </p>
<p>And we did.We had a splendid day, started off by a long long "let's cuddle!" suggestion by Miss Mirei. Unlike Kelly's Bryn, Caillie, and Riku, all of whom always wanted to be read a big stack of books in the morning in bed, Mirei prefers to talk ... about what we are going to do today, what we might do tomorrow, and going over some of the things that happened yesterday. I get lots of hugs around the neck, lots of attention if I need some ... she is <strong>very</strong> good at finding the pressure points in my face when my sinuses are bad, or rubbing any sore spot she thinks I might have. I get an extra blanket and an animal too, and then we get to "talk" animal talk together, as she always gathers one in for herself too. </p>
<p>After lunch she and I headed out on the bus to a playground at the top of Noe Valley. I hadn't been there for years, but I spotted a pet store on the opposite corner as we got off the bus, so we went in to check it out. There was a big friendly dog to get past first; Mirei loves the idea of dogs, and is fine petting their back ends, but she is very nervous about their teeth and tongue being too close to her. Once we were at the back of the store, she was just thrilled with all the birds in large cages: lovebirds, parrots, finches, and others. We spent at least a half hour while she checked them all out, and then checked them out again. She now does a great imitation of a parrot moving up and down! </p>
<p>The playground at the corner of 24th and Diamond has been completely redone since I was last there with Bryn and Caillie ... many years ago! They have the soft cushiony padding down, a large curving sandbox, and a great little climbing set, more for the younger children, rather than Riku's age group. There are also some climb-on toys and a see-saw, so enough to keep Mirei happy for a good two hours, especially with all the darling young babies and children around! We met ten-month-old Noah and his dad, Andy, then a little girl named Nova, and after that a darling little boy called Cooper, who it turned out is a neighbour of Noah's! All the parents were totally smitten with Mirei and her motherly ways with their little ones. Mirei is sweet and affectionate with them, and they smile and smile at her ... as she does them. Mirei insists she is not going to have a baby "because it hurts too much", but I hope she ends up with at least four of them! What a great mom she is going to be! </p>
<p>Mirei asked for a "treat" before leaving Noe Valley, so I bought her a little tub of Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream which she ate on the bus on the way home. There was a friendly woman standing behind us on the crowded bus, and she engaged Mirei in quite a conversation, talking about how pretty Mirei was, and about her own little granddaughter too. Mirei is quite happy to chat with strangers, although can be shy in some situations. </p>
<p>When we were on the bus on the way to the playground, I thought I had left my camera at home, but the more I thought about it the more I convinced myself that I <strong>had</strong> put it in my purse. But as the time went on, I somehow believed that it had fallen out when the snack pack I was carrying fell on the floor of the bus. I was so upset to not only lose the camera, but also to miss out on all the great shots of Mirei with the little ones today. Sure enough, when I got home it was not where I thought I might have left it, and I phoned the bus office to report it missing.</p>
<p>We read a nice stack of books tonight at the table while Mirei was eating her dinner. It was a nice treat as we don't often do this, and certainly never this many.  </p>
<p>As I was reading to Mirei in bed, Doug opened the bedroom door, much to my surprise (it's not something he would normally do), to let me know that he had found my camera ... in my purse! It had just worked down into the corner of my almost empty bag and I just hadn't felt around for it long enough. Whew! Doug had been thinking about how hard it would be for the camera to fall out if it, as the way the purse is designed would make that difficult for sure. </p>
<p>First I felt relief, of course, but I was also sad that I had missed all the afternoon shots out with Mirei. But, what would I have done if I had lost it??? Lucky me! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/birds_babies_and_books.html">Pancakes, Puzzles, and Painting</a></h2>
								<p>It's Sunday, so we decided to make Grandpa pancakes. Mirei helped with each stage of the mixing up as she always does if there is anything to be cooked! I took lots of photos of her doing each step, and she reminded me to "take a picture, Nana!" if I had overlooked a photo op'! The pancakes were delicious: Mirei was delighted with the heart-shaped one I made for her, and served Doug the homemade applesauce he was putting on his first couple today. </p>
<p>After her "morning routine" Mirei went upstairs and brought down several of the Ravensburger puzzles that all of the grandchildren have done over the years. She, like the others, is very good at them, and often finds a particular piece we are looking for before me. We worked one of the three together but it was more fun to watch her face as she scouted out the right piece for the right spot. </p>
<p>Mirei realized she had painted only one picture since she came to San Francisco, so out came the paints. She painted a glorious happy pair of flowers and was especially pleased when she found out that I had a little bit of white paint and she could indeed have <strong>pink</strong>! She quite enjoyed mixing up her own shade of her favourite colour for the rest of that painting, and the next one of a tall house too. </p>
<p>We had talked about making cookies as a "surprise for Daddy", so we got right to that after the painting was done. I took a kazillion photos of Mirei baking with me again; she loved using the mixer, turning it on and off between adding the dry ingredients, as well as pushing the batter down away from the sides of our very full bowl. I didn't have the right candy bar for these wonderful cookies of Judi's, so I cut up some Turtles and Mirei was very happy scooping them up and adding them to the batter. She could hardly wait to lick the batters!</p>
<p>The cookies were made of oatmeal, chocolate chips, Turtles, and dried cherries; some oatmeal and bits and pieces of the chopped Turtles had fallen to the floor during the measuring, so Mirei got busy with the broom and dustpan and did a great job sweeping it all up! What a girl she is; she even said "You shouldn't have to do everything, Nana, so I will help you." ... and she really did. She even volunteered to wash the paint holders; of course she loved holding the sprayer and did a great job managing that too, and I was only too happy to dry them, as she suggested. </p>
<p>We had expected Bryn and Riku home earlier in the afternoon and thought we might have an outing to a playground with him. However, by the time we had tidied up they still weren't home, so Mirei suggested a trike ride on the sidewalk. Mirei hasn't had a lot of practice at steering at all, and she went all the way up two long blocks figuring that out very well, well enough that she could steer into and out of a small space at the town house complex to "scare" me. </p>
<p>We were on our way up from the opposite side of the sidewalk when Bryn and Riku pulled into the garage. I'm not sure if Mirei was happier to see her Dad, or he her! Lots of big hugs and many kisses, while Riku told me about some of his adventures in Sacramento. I heard more over dinner time with the children; Riku loved being in the pool with his dad, Amelia, and Finn, he loved the high flying swings (Bryn sent photos to us), and Mirei got to tell Riku about the birds and the new playground too. Bryn said next summer Mirei would go with them too. I'm thinking that a really inexpensive summer holiday treat would be three days in a hotel with a pool, or even four days! Just think of the money we would save on gas, and we could just hang out all day long in the pool. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/lots_of_books_and_our_playgrou.html">Errands, "Our Playground", and a New Book Too!</a></h2>
								<p>We had tentative plans to go to a movie today, either with Susan and the children or on our own, but the morning was a busy one with both children involved with either drawing or reading. It seemed we had plenty to do to keep busy, plus Riku had homework as well. He's quite keen to get some done every day, and said he was worried about not finishing it. So he did two full pages today of math and Japanese writing, and filled in some titles of books for his reading list. Mirei read to me from her current book, but today we started in the middle and went forward from there. By the time she gets through most of it, she is not so keen to keep at it, so this seemed like a good plan. </p>
<p>Mirei drew me two pictures today and now signs them to me as well, each and every time without my asking. She was cross with me at one point, though, and went to an older picture she had drawn for me that was hanging on the fridge, crossed off "Nana" and printed in "Mommy". Later she apologized to me and said she would never do that again. </p>
<p>After a big lunch of mac' and cheese with carrots, spinach, and their one piece of candy from Riku's trip yesterday, the three of us headed off to run some errands, followed by playground time. </p>
<p>They are both always happy to go to Rainbow with me, to sample the cheese, and to help pick out the carrots. It was a quick trip for more strawberries and yogurt, and then we set off for Costco for a few items there. Mirei had memorized our list three days ago and she had it down pat: oranges, dates for date squares, and skin cream "for Daddy". They like the samples there too, and had yogurt, and some chicken and fish too. </p>
<p>When Riku first came he called the playground on 23rd Street, just a half dozen blocks from their old house, "my playground", but in this past week it has become "ours", including Mirei in it now. I was willing to go to a new playground Bryn went to with Mirei two weeks ago, but Riku insisted he was okay going to this closer one. It worked out beautifully, as it gave us more time there, and a nice grassy space where Riku and I could use the badminton set. Mirei started off playing with him, but soon found some children her own age, and spent the two-plus hours we were there mostly with them. I was surprised to see her with a lime paleta (Mexican Popsicle) at one point; one of the girls' dads had bought them all one, and Mirei was delighted. She shared the end of it with Riku too. </p>
<p>Riku and I had such fun whacking the bird back and forth to each other. Riku is getting so good at hitting and serving, and was thrilled to bits with it all. The running around was good for me too, and it was mostly how Riku wanted to spend his time. An older boy stood around watching until I asked if he wanted to play for a while, so they did. He was a nice boy and told us his name when he left, and said he hoped he could play again one day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mirei was asked by two slightly older girls if she wanted them to paint her arm. They were so cute and had come prepared with their face-painting kit. They took turns putting on Mirei's favourite pink and purple colours with some white added in as well. </p>
<p>When I gave the fifteen-minute warning before leaving, they got busy on the roundabout with some other children, mostly doing the running to keep it moving. Riku dashed off on his own to climb to the top of the dome rope structure, and was up there faster than I imagined he could. One last spin down the twister pole for both children and we were on our way home for baths and dinner time. </p>
<p>The children ate a great dinner: bean, cheese, and rice burritos, a custard cup full of corn, and cucumbers. Riku had an orange for dessert and Mirei chose to have "a bowl of custard with just one strawberry on top." They both were busy with books during dinner; we don't always do this, but it was just the three of us at the table and I was happy to oblige. </p>
<p>Riku discovered a book we had ordered for him, not hidden away well enough. While I was tucking in Mirei he spotted it on the counter and when I joined him in the kitchen he asked if we could read it. He loved the title "The Sound of Colors... a Journey of the Imagination. How he enjoyed the half of it we read ... to be continued in the morning. Many thanks to Brooke Speirs who discovered this book, and who encouraged me to buy it. </p>
<p>Mirei was asleep at 7:35 and Riku before 8 P.M. I couldn't resist taking a photo of them when I went in to check on them later in the evening. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/07/post_18.html">The Maira Kalman Exhibit at the Jewish Contemporary Museum</a></h2>
								<p>After the sweet photo of the children sleeping last night, I couldn't resist getting one of them this morning, being anything but sleepy! They had lots of fun rolling around on the bed for the longest time, taking animals and babies in with them, and finally emerging for some quiet drawing at the table while they had their fruit plates. </p>
<p>Riku decided after breakfast he had better get some of his homework done, so Mirei continued taking care of the babies and animals. </p>
<p>Today Riku surprised me by making the bed himself. It was quite a challenge after all the tossing and turning of the duvet but he worked away at it and did a very good job. With Mirei now sweeping the kitchen floor quite regularly, and both of them folding their PJs in the mornings, I told them I would give them a quarter every Sunday if they kept it up. I know, it's child labour for certain, but they are very excited about their new earning power! </p>
<p>I had intended to go to the Jewish Contemporary Museum since it opened on Mission Street a couple of years ago, perhaps, but had never made it there. Susan told me the other day that there was an exhibit there that she planned to take Amelia to, and suggested that we come along. </p>
<p>We had time at home for Riku to work on his homework, and Mirei read to me as well. Nice to have that out of the way so early in the day, and both children were happy doing it. </p>
<p>I hadn't heard of the very well known and respected illustrator, writer, and collector of whimsy, but Susan thought that there was a good chance I would recognize some of her work. I did, all from The New Yorker covers I have seen here at the house, but it turned out that I had also read one of her children's books to Riku, about a dog who eats everything from A to Z. </p>
<p>Susan treated me to the exhibit and the children were admitted free, and given very interesting small plastic boxes with a handle, containing clues to a hunt for particular objects, a notebook for observations, and some fun objects to think about. Riku and Amelia particularly enjoyed the search for a key, a shoe, and a rubber band, and all of them enjoyed working with the small felt boards, making various faces with them, and drawing them in their notebooks before changing them once again. I loved felt boards when I was a child, and must get some in for the children. They're light and easy to carry too, so would be a great addition to the drawing pads and pencils in restaurants and the car. </p>
<p>I enjoyed this well enough that I would love to go back and see more of it at my own pace and interest, as I too love to collect whimsy, if on a much lesser scale! However, my old wooden thread spools, tiny packets of my grandmother's sewing needles, hooks and eyes, ancient baking utensils, tiny figures, and household objects, plus many other items I own, would have fit in perfectly there.  </p>
<p>We were all hungry when we finished up, so we decided on lunch at Mel's. All the children had small milkshakes — strawberry for Amelia, chocolate for Mirei, and vanilla for Riku — along with their grilled cheese sandwiches. Susan snapped a photo of them drinking their shakes, which I will include here. One day the children will love having a peek at these, as will we. </p>
<p>Today the children had been invited over for a playdate with a friend of Amelia's. Riku and Ivan are a year apart in age, but Ivan has similar interests to Riku — art, reading, and Ultraman — so Bryn really wanted them to get together. Anabel and Mirei are just a few days apart in age, I believe, so they are likely to get along as well. We had some quiet time at home before driving to their home in the Mission District at 3:30. I came home to get a few things caught up, mostly blog entries and photos, but also to prepare dinner. </p>
<p>Doug picked them up at 5:15 and they all drove to the train station to meet Bryn coming in on a 5:40 train from the valley. Bryn was delighted to see the children at the station platform, although Mirei found the train very loud, but she got to tell him about her time with Anabel, and Riku about visiting with Ivan. They all enjoyed it very much, which was lovely, as they haven't had a lot of playdates this summer. </p>
<p>We had dinner as soon as everyone was home, followed by our usual evening routine. The children were tired and fell asleep easily, and I got a few more days worth of photos caught up after that. </p>
