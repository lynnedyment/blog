								<h2>The Maira Kalman Exhibit at the Jewish Contemporary Museum</h2>
								<p>After the sweet photo of the children sleeping last night, I couldn't resist getting one of them this morning, being anything but sleepy! They had lots of fun rolling around on the bed for the longest time, taking animals and babies in with them, and finally emerging for some quiet drawing at the table while they had their fruit plates. </p>
<p>Riku decided after breakfast he had better get some of his homework done, so Mirei continued taking care of the babies and animals. </p>
<p>Today Riku surprised me by making the bed himself. It was quite a challenge after all the tossing and turning of the duvet but he worked away at it and did a very good job. With Mirei now sweeping the kitchen floor quite regularly, and both of them folding their PJs in the mornings, I told them I would give them a quarter every Sunday if they kept it up. I know, it's child labour for certain, but they are very excited about their new earning power! </p>
<p>I had intended to go to the Jewish Contemporary Museum since it opened on Mission Street a couple of years ago, perhaps, but had never made it there. Susan told me the other day that there was an exhibit there that she planned to take Amelia to, and suggested that we come along. </p>
<p>We had time at home for Riku to work on his homework, and Mirei read to me as well. Nice to have that out of the way so early in the day, and both children were happy doing it. </p>
<p>I hadn't heard of the very well known and respected illustrator, writer, and collector of whimsy, but Susan thought that there was a good chance I would recognize some of her work. I did, all from The New Yorker covers I have seen here at the house, but it turned out that I had also read one of her children's books to Riku, about a dog who eats everything from A to Z. </p>
<p>Susan treated me to the exhibit and the children were admitted free, and given very interesting small plastic boxes with a handle, containing clues to a hunt for particular objects, a notebook for observations, and some fun objects to think about. Riku and Amelia particularly enjoyed the search for a key, a shoe, and a rubber band, and all of them enjoyed working with the small felt boards, making various faces with them, and drawing them in their notebooks before changing them once again. I loved felt boards when I was a child, and must get some in for the children. They're light and easy to carry too, so would be a great addition to the drawing pads and pencils in restaurants and the car. </p>
<p>I enjoyed this well enough that I would love to go back and see more of it at my own pace and interest, as I too love to collect whimsy, if on a much lesser scale! However, my old wooden thread spools, tiny packets of my grandmother's sewing needles, hooks and eyes, ancient baking utensils, tiny figures, and household objects, plus many other items I own, would have fit in perfectly there.  </p>
<p>We were all hungry when we finished up, so we decided on lunch at Mel's. All the children had small milkshakes — strawberry for Amelia, chocolate for Mirei, and vanilla for Riku — along with their grilled cheese sandwiches. Susan snapped a photo of them drinking their shakes, which I will include here. One day the children will love having a peek at these, as will we. </p>
<p>Today the children had been invited over for a playdate with a friend of Amelia's. Riku and Ivan are a year apart in age, but Ivan has similar interests to Riku — art, reading, and Ultraman — so Bryn really wanted them to get together. Anabel and Mirei are just a few days apart in age, I believe, so they are likely to get along as well. We had some quiet time at home before driving to their home in the Mission District at 3:30. I came home to get a few things caught up, mostly blog entries and photos, but also to prepare dinner. </p>
<p>Doug picked them up at 5:15 and they all drove to the train station to meet Bryn coming in on a 5:40 train from the valley. Bryn was delighted to see the children at the station platform, although Mirei found the train very loud, but she got to tell him about her time with Anabel, and Riku about visiting with Ivan. They all enjoyed it very much, which was lovely, as they haven't had a lot of playdates this summer. </p>
<p>We had dinner as soon as everyone was home, followed by our usual evening routine. The children were tired and fell asleep easily, and I got a few more days worth of photos caught up after that. </p>
