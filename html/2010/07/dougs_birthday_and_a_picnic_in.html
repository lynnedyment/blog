								<h2>Doug's Birthday and a Picnic in the Park</h2>
								<p>Mirei slept for thirteen hours and twenty minutes last night! I slept with her, which is a rare event, and she awakened about 4 A.M. with a pain in her leg. She was quite upset and was crying hard, but was back to sleep after some cuddling time. Bryn was driving friends to the airport at 4:45 or I would have given in to her request to see her Daddy. </p>
<p>All was fine this morning, and she asked me to cuddle with her in the bed. We did so, read a story, and played with the animals, again not something we tend to do much in the mornings. Mirei is always happy to sit and have her fruit plate after snuggling for a bit, but today was a sweet change from our usual routine. </p>
<p>There were several "Happy Birthday" phone calls for Doug this morning, and Mirei got to talk with Auntie Gail during one of them.</p>
<p>She and Bryn left at 11:45 for a picnic at "Mother's Meadow"; friends of Bryn's and Susan's were visiting from Denmark and had arranged this playdate for old friends and colleagues. Susan called, inviting Doug and me along, so at 2:30 we joined them. </p>
<p>What a perfect picnic day it was! The sun was shining, the air was warm and the park was so crowded Doug had trouble parking. Bryn had to leave right away for a meeting downtown, so we got to see Amelia, Finn, and Mirei running about playing with various children gathered there, not all of them from the reunion group. Amelia was delighted when she got to play baseball with tall, gorgeous blonde-as-her Maxx, Finn and Mirei played ball with two other younger children, and there was lots of running about up and down the various slides and climbing structures. Finn and Doug had a game of frisbee tossing too, and I caught one moment on camera where it looked like they weren't sure just where that frisbeen had gone! </p>
<p>We stayed on until 4 P.M., chatting with Susan and Kevin until we really had to leave to pick up a few groceries for Doug's birthday dinner tonight. </p>
<p>Once home, Mirei played happily in the tub, washing off the day's dust and shampooing her baby's hair, while I made up a "meaty" tomato sauce for our penne pasta, with a salad to go along with it. Mirei had time to finish up Doug's birthday card too, and proudly presented it to him. </p>
<p>Bryn and Mirei hung up lots of pink balloons along the edge of the French doors in the kitchen area, and we were all set. Mirei doesn't eat much salad in Japan but was just great at eating the small bowl that Bryn said to give her. What a co-operative little girl she is, as she wasn't sure about it, but ate every bite of it anyway ... plus the kidney beans in the bottom of the bowl. </p>
<p>Doug opened his gifts from Susan and Kevin ... books by, and a reading to hear Bill Bryson speak in October,  a book of movie coupons from Bryn and Akane for <strong>lots</strong> of movies in the following year, and my gift to him was a pass to a local comedic film festival a little later this month. </p>
<p>Mirei was very happy to help Doug blow out the candles on his cheesecake, and sang "Happy Birthday" with much gusto too! </p>
<p>Doug and Bryn left at 6:30 for a movie; Mirei and I were sitting at the table chatting while she finished off a little more of her dinner, when she started to cry about her leg hurting again. It sounds like "growing pains" to me, as Bryn had them too, and she asked to go right to bed. I got her ready quickly, and placed two warm "bed buddies" on her left leg while reading her two stories. I think they helped as she settled down very quickly and told me she would be fine in the morning. Good thing as there is another picnic going on! </p>
<p>Mirei was asleep at 7:30 tonight and then it was time to tackle the kitchen clean-up. </p>
