								<h2>Sociable Sunday and Packing Up!</h2>
								<p>Today was a busy, fun, sociable day for the children especially. Riku wanted the entire family to go to "Jim's Diner" in the Mission District for breakfast and today was the day. We went early, leaving about 8:15, and were there early enough to get "our" booth, the big curved one in the front window. The children shared a milkshake, and had their usual egg and hash browns. I can't taste much because of my ongoing sinus problem and am trying not to eat eggs right now, so ordered a double order of hash browns! I ate half of them, and brought the rest home to freeze. My eyes were certainly bigger than my stomach today! </p>
<p>Riku sat and did a double lot of homework with his mom, just to get a good start at it, and Mirei did her reading. They didn't have much time back at home, because they were meeting Soo for brunch at 11 A.M. Riku was not thrilled to be going out to yet another restaurant with another car ride (he is so much like Bryn was at the same age). However, they were back in about two hours and he loved his meal, and I'm sure Soo was delighted to meet up with everyone again. </p>
<p>I left for a quick trip to Rainbow to get some groceries for the trip, so Riku did a little more homework while I was gone. Akane went off on her own to do some shopping while Bryn drove to Palo Alto to pick up his computer for the trip tomorrow. Everyone was on the go today! </p>
<p>I spent most of the day checking my packing list and making piles of all that was going with us. The children kept busy with their own various amusements ... Mirei with her dolls and books, and Riku with his drawings and books.</p>
<p>Mirei entertained me and posed for me as well in her grandfather's pink baseball cap; it suited her to a T. </p>
<p>I had an early dinner ready for them, a long relaxing bath and play time, and their usual bedtimes at 7:30 and 8 P.M. </p>
<p>I was feeling very organized right up until then, with all the laundry done and put away, and the stacks of clothes ready to be packed. My intention was to go to bed at a reasonable hour as well, but the phone rang at 9:30 and it was Patrizia calling from Mexico City! We had so much to catch up on, and of course I can't do so when the children are up and about, so really it was the perfect time. We talked for almost an hour and a half, and it was so good to find out what was going on in their lives there. </p>
<p>Bedtime was later than planned but I may sleep with the children on the long trip to L.A. tomorrow. </p>
