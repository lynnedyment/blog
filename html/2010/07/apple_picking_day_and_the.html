								<h2>Apple-Picking Day and Franklin Square Playground</h2>
								<p>Each night at tuck-in time Mirei always likes to remind me what plans we have for the next day. Last night she asked me if we were going to pick apples, and I assured her that we would indeed. That made her very happy, and this morning that was the first question of the day; I guess she's checking to make sure I haven't forgotten. </p>
<p>We went out for a little walk later this morning, stopping to mail a package for Doug on our way to run an errand. It was breezier than I hoped it would be so I ruled out our Ocean Beach afternoon. </p>
<p>Our neighbour Ralph was outside and we stopped to chat to him; Mirei is such a sociable little girl and is happy to chat away with someone she considers she knows. Later when we were going out in the car, Doug was talking with him while I locked up, and Mirei joined them, asking Ralph where his glasses were! She realized that he wasn't wearing them and of course he was amazed that she had noticed such a thing. He told Doug she was a detective in the making!</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the morning in the house. That seems to suit us all well, especially after a busy day out the day before. So, we puttered about, having a nice lazy morning. Bryn was home for part of it, so he joined in some of the fun. Mirei does have a way of entertaining us all for sure! I did a little video recording twice during this time, as she was singing merrily away.</p>
<p>I pulled the big container of plastic blocks out  early, as Mirei enjoyed building with them yesterday. She sat quietly on her own in the living room, putting together a two-house village, asking me not to knock it down as she will play with it more "later".  While picking up all the blocks together we pulled out the wooden beads from the box, and I set her up at the table with a long thick threaded needle. She made a very nice necklace for herself in just a few minutes and modeled it for me too. </p>
<p>Since she was still in a construction mode I got out a set of open plastic cubes, and they kept Mirei very busy while I made her second breakfast and tidied up the kitchen. She did get down to help me load the dishwasher, though, as she takes great pride in knowing where things go now, and is careful with the glassware especially. </p>
<p>After lunch, Doug, Mirei, and I drove to the other side of the city to pick apples from a FreeCycler's garden. I responded to this posting a few days ago and was delighted when I heard back that we could come by any time we liked with bags and a small step-stool. Doug picked Mirei up for some ripe pickings and she got to climb up on the step-stool as well. She loved it as I knew she would, and now we are making plans for making applesauce, plus at least one apple pie baking session too. </p>
<p>The sun was out, and Doug had errands to run, so he dropped Mirei and me off at Franklin Square, a playground that Mirei enjoyed so much before the move to Japan, and last fall when she visited. Today she really lucked out, as she met a great "friend" not long after we got there, and he was very energetic. Mirei was determined to keep up and did so; she did not want to leave at 4:30, but she had said she was hungry so we had to get home. His dad told me that they live very close to Mirei's "old house" on 23rd Street so we are hoping that we might run into them again. </p>
<p>Bryn was here when we got home, so that was great. Mirei got to tell him lots of stories, had a snack, and enjoyed a long tub time with three of her plastic "kitchen" bowls and pans, plus eight or more small balls ... and two spoons too!  </p>
<p>Bryn had dinner with us tonight, but it wasn't quite enough time for Mirei! First Grandpa left and she wanted him to stay home, so when Bryn left to go out with a friend after that, Mirei cried, asking him to stay home with her. She had asked for extra kisses and hugs from them both so she is obviously wanting more male companionship in the evening!  It didn't take her long to stop crying, especially after we made plans to go out one day and leave Grandpa begging for more hugs and kisses. </p>
<p>Mirei read her book to me tonight, and then I read her the first of "My Everyday Story Book", the one I won in grade one for being the best reader. Mirei enjoyed "Sally's Lost Shoe" as much as I knew she would, and I promised we would read the next story tomorrow. </p>
<p>Just before Mirei nodded off, she rolled over and said to me in a very quiet voice "Nana, we forgot to make the applesauce!" and was asleep two minutes later (at 7:35), after I had assured her that we would make it in the morning, which was actually the plan all along.</p>
