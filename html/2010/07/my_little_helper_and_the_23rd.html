								<h2>My Little Helper and the 23rd Street Playground</h2>
								<p>Once again, Mirei and I spent the whole morning at home today, as I had plans to do a big grocery shopping trip today, hoped to get to Costco, and Mirei was looking forward to going to the 23rd Street playground, in her old neighbourhood, She had learned yesterday that the boy in the yellow shirt lives very close to that playground and that is mostly where he plays. </p>
<p>Bryn was home until 10 A.M. today, so Mirei had three of us to entertain. She and Bryn did her reading "homework" first thing this morning, tucked into bed together, once again she helped me make her scrambled egg breakfast: she cracks the eggs perfectly, washes the "goop" off her hands and uses the spatula to push the eggs around in the frying pan until they are "just right." </p>
<p>For the longest time Mirei sat at the table after eating, drawing more flower pictures for me, and signing them to me too. I was tidying out a double cupboard in the kitchen while she was playing with the same plastic blocks as yesterday but when she spotted some cotton batting I was going to throw away, she decided to get busy with glue and tape as well. </p>
<p>Her babies got lots of attention this morning, starting off by tucking in the bunny with a "tissue" blanket in her bedroom, and moving on to the living room, where she had Raggedy Ann and Andy, as well as a puppy, and the same bunny keeping them all company. </p>
<p>We had every intention of making the applesauce today, but we all know how hard it is to fit everything in while tending to little ones! Mirei's babies "cried" a lot and so Mirei was running back and forth from the kitchen, where she was drawing and working with the big plastic blocks again, filling me in each time with what was going on with them.</p>
<p>Mirei and I went off to Rainbow, 20% coupon in hand, on the last day it can be used this week. So the store was very crowded, but Mirei happily sat in the cart so that I could hand her each item I bought and she could twist around and place it carefully in the buggy. She had the grocery list in hand too, and whenever she put an item in the buggy, I showed her where it was on the list, so she could cross it off. What a big helper she was! Mirei also chats to people we pass too, and often says "hello" to them in a nice friendly voice. She makes lots of instant friends this way! </p>
<p>As a special treat we bought some organic ice cream sandwiches, one of Doug's favourite things from his childhood. I promised Mirei that they could each sit down and have one when we got home, while I put the groceries away, and then we would go to the playground. I shouldn't have promised, as there were a lot of groceries to sort through and put away, and it was 4 o'clock before we headed out the door. </p>
<p>I reminded Mirei twice before we got there, that we wouldn't be able to stay long and she went into the funniest monologue about it ... something along the lines of "Oh, how many times do you want to tell me that? Ten? Twenty? Maybe you would like to tell me again at dinner time? Or you could tell me at tuck-in time. How about tomorrow?" This was all said in a voice so much like Riku's that it made me howl, and of course the harder I laughed the more she would add to it. </p>
<p>She was so good about leaving after just one half hour, but she managed to fit in a quick turn at all the things to do there except the rope dome. Mirei had taken a ball along too, so we played catch for a while on the grassed-in area, and a little soccer too. </p>
<p>Home, tub, dinner ... it goes like clockwork, with time for the ever-present drawing too. We read the second story in "The Everyday Storybook" about Ben, the dog who is jealous of the new kitten in the family. Mirei is enjoying these stories very much, and always wants to turn the page before we finish up to see what tomorrow's story will be. Jiggers is coming up next! </p>
<p>Riku and Akane will be here with us one week tonight! </p>
