								<h2>Pancakes, Playground, and an Afternoon Visit with Finn</h2>
								<p>Riku and Mirei both came up and had a snuggle with me this morning, at 7:15. So lovely to see those bright morning smiles! </p>
<p>The children had their fruit bowls up in our bed while I showered. Chatting later about what they would have for their next course,  they decided we would have pancakes. So downstairs we all went. </p>
<p>Mirei did the dry portion first, expertly measuring out the flour, baking soda, and salt, while Riku took care of the wet ingredients: egg, milk, and vanilla yogurt. He hasn't forgotten how to break an egg properly, and they both stood on chairs and watched as the other did his or her part. The pancakes were delicious, but Riku broke out in an allergic reaction right at the beginning of breakfast. Akane and I are both quite sure it was a reaction to the flour. This happened to him many years ago at a friend's in West Vancouver; I think it happens when he gets the flour on his hands and then on his face. Akane had an allergy tablet for him to take, so the red patches and the terribly itchy eyes and skin stopped within an hour or so. </p>
<p>Finn was due to come over at 1 o'clock today, so the three of us went off to the playground at the top of the hill at Riku's suggestion. It was so quiet there, which was surprising, as it was such a gorgeous morning, warm and sunny, so much so that the children spent quite a bit of time under the climbing structure enjoying the shade. </p>
<p>Two big events today; Riku jumped down from the highest point of the structure today, and did it often enough that I was able to catch him in mid-jump! He'll be delighted when he sees the shot tomorrow. Mirei watched a child slide down the fireman's pole several times and decided she wanted to do that too. She did it, with just the smallest amount of help from me. </p>
<p>Mirei has become very opinionated about what she wants to eat these days. Today she decided it would be pizza for lunch; when I suggested something else, she said "I should be the one who decides Nana, because I have to eat it."! And then she reminded me that we still had one pizza shell left over from a few days ago! This child doesn't forget a thing; she obviously remembered that there were two shells in the package. It was so easy to make and Riku thought it was the best pizza he has had for a long long time, "maybe ever!". Doug was drooling after his boring lunch of the third helping this week of a split pea soup from a packaged mix he had bought some time ago. When he tasted it, he thought it was as good as any we have had from any pizzeria, so I'll be stocking up on these wonderful cornmeal bases. It's fast and easy to add some bottled yummy tomato sauce we have discovered through Tay, some oregano, fresh basil, and Parmesan cheese. I must get in some mozzarella. </p>
<p>Finn arrived at 1:15 or so, and the afternoon went by in a flurry of activities! I could see bedlam reigning if I didn't set some limits, so the rule was that they picked up what they had been playing with before pulling something new out. It worked. Finn told me at his playschool they have to "clean up after myself but I don't mind, I like to." Me too! ... having them do this, I mean. Here's a list of some of their activities: gardening at least four different times, pulled lots of weeds and swept too, cars, plastic blocks and car racing set upstairs, "Captain Hook" Finn, with Mirei and Riku going along with his imagination, complete with sword and shield in hand, snack time twice, punching the ball that Doug uses for a chair, Riku's iPod demo (which left Mirei out for a bit, and she was not a happy girl at this turn of events), and various running-around games that involved lots of noise. They sat and drew together at the end of the visit, so I was able to make dinner and listen to them chat as they worked away with paper, stickers, and markers. </p>
<p>Amelia came in from her horseback riding demonstration, which came at the end of this week-long riding day camp. She and Riku were happy to see each other, and we hope there will be some fun playdates this summer, despite their busy schedules and ours too. </p>
<p>Tub time with more soapy bubbles in the tub, fried veggie rice for dinner, which they both enjoyed and ate up quickly, no dessert for Riku (although this is typical for him), and custard for Mirei and Grandpa too. I tucked Mirei in, and came out to find Bryn home with Riku doing his reading to him. They're working on the next "Captain Underpants" series. </p>
<p>Mirei was asleep by 7:30 and Riku went to bed just after 8 o'clock. I went in to check on him about twenty minutes after saying goodnight, and found the two children closely snuggled up beside one another, with Mirei's arm flung over him. They did very well sleeping together last night so this looks like a working plan for the summer! </p>
