								<h2>Such a Sociable Sunday!</h2>
								<p>Well, today may just top the list of the number of visitors for Riku in one day! Friends of Bryn's are wanting to spend time with him, two of them today(!), but Riku had other plans in mind. He really wanted to have another visit with Kai; he knows Kai is going to summer camp tomorrow and so knows that he won't see much of him for five more days. So, we managed to come up with a plan that worked for everyone. </p>
<p>Sean and Gen' had suggested Riku join them at Stern Grove, but Bryn and I knew Riku would rather do something more active than listen to music, albeit outdoors in a beautiful setting. Bern, another friend, wanted to spend some time with Riku in the afternoon, so after a few phone calls all was sorted out and Riku had a most wonderful day. </p>
<p>Kai's dad walked him over at 10:30, and the boys spent their time in much the same way as they did two days ago ... in the garden searching for bugs, working side by side at the little desk in the kitchen, and today played together with the clay as well, which they both enjoyed. </p>
<p>At one point Kevin came by with two bags filled with food from their fridge for us; they were leaving for a week at a farm today, and we are the recipients of lots of great leftovers and the produce for some good meals too. We all went out to say goodbye to Susan and the children before they left. </p>
<p>Kai and Riku had a nice lunch together, then a little more playtime until 12:30, when Doug walked Kai home, with Riku along for company too. </p>
<p>Riku arrived home just in time to greet Bern at the door, and not long after that they went off to Dolores Park, another playground on Riku's list. Sean and Gen' met them there, and I think it was a very active two hours! Riku's cheeks were glowing with colour when he came in the house beaming a big smile. Sean told me that they did lots of running and playing, and it showed! They all came back here for more time with him, which was great, as I hadn't seen Sean and Gen' since we all went to the tide pools together in the spring. </p>
<p>Riku is very interested in doing science experiments right now, so at the moment I have two containers in my freezer. One contains dirt and needles from the pine tree, and another has blue water, made with water and a marker, and a penny and a nickel frozen solid in the middle of the container. They all talked at great length about bugs, and interesting facts about them, and Gen', who is a high school science teacher, has promised to organize some interesting experiments the next time they are together. </p>
<p>Sean and Riku went outside to play some serious basketball. At the tide pool Sean had spent lots of time teaching Riku how to catch and throw a football. Today he taught him to shoot baskets, and how Riku loved all the time they spent on their own in the garden. </p>
<p>Then the doorbell rang, and it was Brent, Michela, and Quentin! Brent hadn't been able to reach Bryn on our phone line for some reason, and decided they would just stop by. It was great to have them join us, as I got to see Quentin again, and his mom and dad too. Quentin wandered about the garden as his dad took over the basketball game from Sean, and he taught Riku how to block the ball when he threw it to him. Riku caught on fast and I think he burned off all the calories he has taken in since he arrived! </p>
<p>Everyone left just after 5 P.M. I got Riku into the tub right away, made him up a big plate of Thai food, lots of broccoli, and rice for dinner, and then he had time after finishing up to draw on the white board above his desk, something he asked to do last night. He polished off a bowl of custard before tuck-in time. </p>
<p>We read a few pages of "The Wizard of Oz", and finished off with the (still-a-favourite) Shel Silverstein book of poems Susan had loaned us. He recalled a funny poem about a boy with lots of aches and pains, who has decided he is far too sick to go to school, and at the end of his long list of ailments finds out it's the weekend and is instantly cured! What a good memory he has, although he enjoys the books so much that it didn't really surprise me. Sound asleep at 8 o'clock tonight. </p>
<p>Bryn, Doug, and I were the happy recipients of Susan's leftovers too, and emptied a few bowls of varied and delicious meals from the fridge tonight. </p>
<p>(And yes, I stayed in my bed this morning, reading for a while, so that I was there, nice and warm, when Riku came up for our snuggle.) Not hard to make this little boy happy!  </p>
