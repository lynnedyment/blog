								<h2>A Day in the Hood</h2>
								<p>Potrero Hill, that is! Riku and I had hoped for an Ocean Beach day today, especially after our gorgeous day yesterday, but it was not to be. The fog didn't lift until after 3 o'clock, and Sutro Tower was hidden in clouds just an hour and a half later. So, we stayed in our own neighbourhood, which worked out well, as we did some fun and varied things today. </p>
<p>I pulled out my old copy of Shel Silverstein's book called "Uncle Shelby's ABZ Book", a very quirky, silly, and often outrageous book. It is really an adult book, but has just enough silly bits that Riku really got a kick out of it. There are some pages that are just too old for him to understand the humour, and I passed by others that would have required far too much of an explanation for him right now. Some are just inappropriate for young children, but the ones he "got" really had him laughing out loud. Doug sat with him a little later on, talking about some of the pages he had already seen and heard, and I snapped a photo of the two of them. </p>
<p>While I did the ironing this morning, and got a couple of emails written, Doug and Riku went to the library in the Mission District to pick up  a few books for Riku, eight in total. There is a book about baby spiders, Shel Silverstein's "The Missing Piece", "A World Full of Monsters" to read to me, a book called "Earthquake" by a Chinese author, another about the human body, with lots of illustrations, another to read to me, called "Sheep Blast Off!", "Baby Beluga" to read/sing to me, and the one we started reading/looking at/discussing tonight about volcanoes ... a nice varied lot of reading for him to choose from over the next week or so. </p>
<p>Riku is enjoying access to my computer and now is able to find his own way to his "favourites" site list (he was starting to do this before moving to Japan), and can easily pick and choose which one of the many choices he has open to him. Today he logged on to the Crayola site, and started filling in an online form! I gave him a pretend email address, after he asked me what his was, and he filled in our phone number, gave the name of a friend, and asked for our address.</p>
<p>He also said he was working on his blog, making Doug and I both smile, and tapped a few lines to his dad on IM too. He knows how to expand the screen now too, and finished up his computer time by making a painting using the Jackson Pollack site. Fun for him, and fun to watch him navigate his way through it all too. </p>
<p>After lunch, I dropped Doug and Riku off at the "playground at the top of the hill", while I went off to Rainbow for groceries on my own. Just over an hour later I joined them, and found Riku playing with Daisy, a little girl from the second grade one class at "Starr King", his former school. Doug said Riku was very happy to see her arrive, with her mom and siblings, and they played together until they left.It turns out there is a small reunion picnic on Saturday for old and new students in the Chinese program, so we may join in on that after Doug's class. Daisy's mom, Meg, sent me the information on this, and also said they would very much like to have Riku over to play one afternoon.  </p>
<p>"Spiderman" arrived in the mail today as expected, from Netflix, and Riku was very keen to see it. So I made a hearty snack for him, and a hot cup of tea for me along with some guacamole and crackers for my lunch. We sat together and watched the first forty-five minutes of it; Riku has such a hearty laugh and obviously was enjoying it!  He was so good about not complaining about having it interrupted so soon, but I had promised him we could cook again today, so he was looking forward to that too. </p>
<p>He sat and drew a picture of Spiderman while I got out all the ingredients for "Signal Hill Gingerbread Cake", an old favourite from years ago in Ontario. Riku was just so happy to be baking again, as over the years we have spent quite a bit of time in the kitchen baking together. He remembered just how to level off the flour and baking soda and spices with the flat of a knife, and how to crack an egg too. He did make funny references to how the batter looked, especially after he had added the molasses ... "vomit" was his chosen word, although "nasty" came up as well, when the egg was first added.  </p>
<p>Soon the cake was in the oven, and Riku was back to his drawing until dinner was ready. Bryn came in much later from work tonight, after a couple of phone meetings, but was home in time to sit with Riku at the table, listen to his stories about his day, and talk about the photos about Pompeii at length. </p>
<p>Riku is a little worried about his swimming lesson tomorrow; even though he enjoyed it on Monday, he now is concerned that he might have to jump in the water. I think he finally accepted it will be fine. Bryn gave him a little talk about not worrying about things before they happen, as often it ends up not being anything to worry about at all. It's a hard lesson to learn for sure. </p>
<p>Riku told me this morning that he didn't wake up in the night at all, did waken when the big hand was at the 9 (quarter to seven), but did what I asked him to, and turned on the light to read. I heard a small noise just five minutes later, likely him getting a book out to read, as that was what he was doing when I joined him for our morning snuggle. He just lit up when I walked in the room; what a greeting! </p>
<p>Today, as we were at the front window waiting to wave goodbye to his dad, Riku wrapped his arm around my neck, put his face close to mine and said "I love your cheeks, Nana, 'cause they are soft, and I love your neck, and your shoulders, and your back, because they are soft <strong>and</strong> warm. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep just a minute or two after 8 P.M. again tonight. </p>
<p>p.s. Riku occasionally will ask me to take a photo of him and then strike a pose. I call this "the look" as it just makes me laugh to see it. I have included one today. </p>
