								<h2>A Laid-Back Lazy Sunday</h2>
								<p>I awoke at 6:30 this morning and crept downstairs, with a feeling that Riku was awake. He was, sitting in bed, covered up in his duvet, working on a book of puzzles that he got on the plane on the way here. It was pretty cute seeing him with his pencil in hand, doing the mazes and counting the various icons on the pages. He sat and worked at them a little longer, while I sat beside him, but soon we were up for his fruit bowl at the table. </p>
<p>Riku likes to dress right away, as the mornings are chilly, and I have been throwing his clothes in the dryer for two minutes so he gets warm quickly. He just wears boxer shorts and a T-shirt to bed, and there's not much fat on his little body to keep him warm. Anyway, he loves the warmth of the clothes in the morning as much as he does his two big warm towels after his bath. I won't be spoiling him like this very often, and it's something he tells me is one of his favourite things when he is at our house. </p>
<p>He was anxious to watch the rest of his movie, but had his fruit bowl, and then a slice of French toast with maple syrup, something he likes and hasn't had very often here anyway. It's filling and tasty and good for him too, and a nice change. He's a little tired of the same ol' egg in one form or another every day, and at least this way it seems like something different to him. </p>
<p>I asked him to do two drawings for school before he watched the movie, and he got right down to it. He has to put his name in Japanese on the back of each drawing and today he put his name in a scroll. Doug asked him how he learned to make scrolls and he said he just remembered that was how to do them. They say "Goda Riku".  </p>
<p>I sat beside him putting nice points on his big box of pencil crayons, and we chatted away as always. I had my breakfast and then we went up to watch "GhostBusters" together until Doug finished up his meal. I left them to watch the rest of it while I took a long hot shower. </p>
<p>Riku had his swimming lesson at 1 o'clock today, although I thought it was a half hour earlier. Bryn went off to find something for his lunch while we waited, and Riku and I played our version of tic tac toe. Doug kept busy the last ten minutes trying to get the tie back in Riku's swimsuit. He almost made it, but the swimming lesson isn't so rigourous that he was going to lose his suit anyway! He had Pam again today, and as Bryn had requested when he went in, Riku spent a few minutes without his goggles on, putting his face in the water, as he will have to do this in Japan. </p>
<p>After a half hour at home with his Lego, Riku went with Bryn to Japantown for an hour and a half, walking around and taking a look at the new big center that has just opened there. I made a hot cup of tea, did some family tree work, answered a few emails, and the time flew by. Riku had a new magazine to read, and a big plastic cloth with lots of things to look at on it, and he got right up on the table to really check it out.Bryn snapped a photo of it, as it's not something he has ever done before. </p>
<p>Doug and Bryn went out for some fruit and veggies, and I made dinner while Riku had his bath. He asked Bryn if he could eat upstairs watching a movie; Bryn told him it was up to me, and how could I possibly refuse? It's the first time we've done this since he arrived, so off the two of us went with our dinners ... a Mexican casserole I used to make many years ago when Kelly and Bryn were still living at home ... and watched "The Swan Princess." It ended right at bedtime, not ideal, but Riku was great, and was asleep as usual at 8 P.M. after finishing the last few poems in his book. Riku was pretty excited that we finished it, too, so tomorrow we will choose another for our bedtime routine. </p>
<p>Doug and Bryn had gone off to a movie ("District 9") about aliens in South Africa, and I had a very quiet evening at home. Bedtime early for me!</p>
