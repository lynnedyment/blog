								<h2><a href="/2009/08/a_visit_from_finn_baker_beach.html">A Visit With Finn, Baker Beach, and "Sea Glass"</a></h2>
								<p>Riku and I had a long snuggle in bed this morning. I was awake and at the computer the day before when he woke at 8:30, and he told me that from now on, he wanted me to stay in bed in the morning so he could come up and snuggle with me. We giggle and he tells me his dreams, and asks about mine, and then he asks, "What's the plan for today?" </p>
<p>He had his fruit bowl in our bed, while I showered, and after the second part of his breakfast he went outside to crack open a geode I had bought for him in Nanaimo. It was hard! He used Doug's hammer and knocked away at it, until he finally put it on the bricks and whacked it really hard. Finally it broke into lots of pieces; I think he was disappointed not to have one large crystal emerge, but the bits were fun too, especially after he washed all the gritty stuff away and had a look at them all outside. </p>
<p>Amelia had a sleepover last night, and Kevin had a few errands to run, so I volunteered to have the children here this morning, while Susan and Kevin got ready for their week at a farm, starting tomorrow. However, Amelia and her guest were busy for the morning and early afternoon, so Kevin dropped Finn off to play with Riku. Riku was thrilled, as he had been asking if he could have them visit, and was quite happy that Finn made it over ... except when Finn broke his log building. However, he was quickly reassured that Grandpa and his dad could rebuild it all, exactly the same, and then he proceeded to show Finn how to build structures. Finn had a great time, and it was very cute to watch them. </p>
<p>They also went outside for a while, sweeping and digging, then upstairs where Riku got out the sit-on train for Finn, and puttered about downstairs too, pulling toys out of the big basket in the laundry room. They had lunch together, and then Finn followed Doug upstairs and spent a while there. When Doug came down, Finn followed him, and then asked Doug, bending over and asking very clearly in a hard-to-resist voice "Grandpa, do you want to go upstairs with me again"? How could he resist such a query? So up they went and Riku had a little time on his own for drawing. </p>
<p>We had made plans with Susan and Kevin and the children to meet up at Baker's Beach in the afternoon, and although it never did get as warm and sunny as I had hoped for, we packed up and left about two o'clock . </p>
<p>Amelia and Riku walked with Doug and me down to the far end of the beach, searching for "sea glass", Amelia's latest passion. You have to have sharp eyes to find the tiny tiny bits of coloured glass, with smooth edges caused by rolling and tumbling about in the sea. I have only ever seen quite large pieces, but even the biggest bits we found today were minuscule. That didn't curb the children's enthusiasm for looking, though, and soon Bryn and Kevin joined in the search too. There were a couple of orange pieces, a lot of green, a few white ones, and Amelia found the only blue one! She and Riku carefully tucked the treasures into the pockets of their kangaroo jackets, although at the end of the day Riku handed all his over to Amelia, but one. He told me she was collecting them, and he wasn't, but it will be fun to look for more of these at Ocean Beach one day. </p>
<p>Finn happily trundled about the beach, the two dads watched over the children and chatted, Doug spent a lot of time with the children when they were still in searching mode, and I sat and took photos once we gave up looking for more glass. </p>
<p>Susan and I had packed up some snacks, so we had cheese and crackers, cherries, Fig Newtons, and various flavours of potato chips. It all hit the spot, although Susan and I would have liked a big thermos of tea, which neither of us thought of beforehand. </p>
<p>We left close to 5 P.M., with Bryn accompanying Susan and family for dinner at a 60s Mexican-style restaurant. Riku was anxious to watch a movie he had borrowed from Amelia, and so after a nice deep warm tub, he was sitting up in bed set to eat his dinner there as Bryn had promised he could. Doug kept him company while I made dinner, and I sat with them while Riku ate. They stopped just a half hour short of the end of the movie, but Riku was fine with that. He knew ahead of time that it was going to be time for bed before it ended, and accepted it gracefully. </p>
<p>He was asleep at 8:30 tonight; I cleaned up the kitchen, wrote up my blog entry, answered a few emails, went through some photos for tomorrow, and went to bed at 11:30.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/such_a_sociable_sunday.html">Such a Sociable Sunday!</a></h2>
								<p>Well, today may just top the list of the number of visitors for Riku in one day! Friends of Bryn's are wanting to spend time with him, two of them today(!), but Riku had other plans in mind. He really wanted to have another visit with Kai; he knows Kai is going to summer camp tomorrow and so knows that he won't see much of him for five more days. So, we managed to come up with a plan that worked for everyone. </p>
<p>Sean and Gen' had suggested Riku join them at Stern Grove, but Bryn and I knew Riku would rather do something more active than listen to music, albeit outdoors in a beautiful setting. Bern, another friend, wanted to spend some time with Riku in the afternoon, so after a few phone calls all was sorted out and Riku had a most wonderful day. </p>
<p>Kai's dad walked him over at 10:30, and the boys spent their time in much the same way as they did two days ago ... in the garden searching for bugs, working side by side at the little desk in the kitchen, and today played together with the clay as well, which they both enjoyed. </p>
<p>At one point Kevin came by with two bags filled with food from their fridge for us; they were leaving for a week at a farm today, and we are the recipients of lots of great leftovers and the produce for some good meals too. We all went out to say goodbye to Susan and the children before they left. </p>
<p>Kai and Riku had a nice lunch together, then a little more playtime until 12:30, when Doug walked Kai home, with Riku along for company too. </p>
<p>Riku arrived home just in time to greet Bern at the door, and not long after that they went off to Dolores Park, another playground on Riku's list. Sean and Gen' met them there, and I think it was a very active two hours! Riku's cheeks were glowing with colour when he came in the house beaming a big smile. Sean told me that they did lots of running and playing, and it showed! They all came back here for more time with him, which was great, as I hadn't seen Sean and Gen' since we all went to the tide pools together in the spring. </p>
<p>Riku is very interested in doing science experiments right now, so at the moment I have two containers in my freezer. One contains dirt and needles from the pine tree, and another has blue water, made with water and a marker, and a penny and a nickel frozen solid in the middle of the container. They all talked at great length about bugs, and interesting facts about them, and Gen', who is a high school science teacher, has promised to organize some interesting experiments the next time they are together. </p>
<p>Sean and Riku went outside to play some serious basketball. At the tide pool Sean had spent lots of time teaching Riku how to catch and throw a football. Today he taught him to shoot baskets, and how Riku loved all the time they spent on their own in the garden. </p>
<p>Then the doorbell rang, and it was Brent, Michela, and Quentin! Brent hadn't been able to reach Bryn on our phone line for some reason, and decided they would just stop by. It was great to have them join us, as I got to see Quentin again, and his mom and dad too. Quentin wandered about the garden as his dad took over the basketball game from Sean, and he taught Riku how to block the ball when he threw it to him. Riku caught on fast and I think he burned off all the calories he has taken in since he arrived! </p>
<p>Everyone left just after 5 P.M. I got Riku into the tub right away, made him up a big plate of Thai food, lots of broccoli, and rice for dinner, and then he had time after finishing up to draw on the white board above his desk, something he asked to do last night. He polished off a bowl of custard before tuck-in time. </p>
<p>We read a few pages of "The Wizard of Oz", and finished off with the (still-a-favourite) Shel Silverstein book of poems Susan had loaned us. He recalled a funny poem about a boy with lots of aches and pains, who has decided he is far too sick to go to school, and at the end of his long list of ailments finds out it's the weekend and is instantly cured! What a good memory he has, although he enjoys the books so much that it didn't really surprise me. Sound asleep at 8 o'clock tonight. </p>
<p>Bryn, Doug, and I were the happy recipients of Susan's leftovers too, and emptied a few bowls of varied and delicious meals from the fridge tonight. </p>
<p>(And yes, I stayed in my bed this morning, reading for a while, so that I was there, nice and warm, when Riku came up for our snuggle.) Not hard to make this little boy happy!  </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/xxx_a_card_for_me_swimming_les.html">A Card for Me,   Swimming Lesson, and Some Basketball Time too!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku had his first of seven private swimming lessons scheduled for 11:30 this morning, so we spent a quiet morning at home. Riku asked me for one of the blank cards and envelopes I keep on hand, as he wanted to "write a note, not draw a picture" for me today. I read the paper at the table, promising not to peek while he did my card. It took him quite a long time and he didn't ask me how to spell any of the words at all. I didn't realize this until just now, many hours later! I think this was a first! On the front he put an American flag on one side, for me, and a Japanese flag on the other side, representing him. I did suggest that next time he could do a Canadian flag for me, but he said that was too hard! I think all the points on the maple leaf lead him to believe he won't do it properly. I'll work on that. The card was very touching; what loving thoughts go through this little boy's head. The drawing on the card shows our meeting at the airport, with the overhead monitor which let us know when they were coming out of customs and immigration, and with Bryn coming in behind him carrying the luggage. </p>
<p>At 11 o'clock we left the house. Riku was quite apprehensive about this class, and was very quiet on the way there. He had told me several times in the morning that he just didn't want to go to this lesson. Poor wee guy; it couldn't possibly be as bad as he thinks it is going to be.</p>
<p>He is just beginning to learn to swim at school in Japan, and he was stressed about that too. It just makes sense that with these seven private lessons he will gain some confidence, and if he's not swimming by the time he leaves, at least we hope he will be more confident in the water. Fingers crossed. </p>
<p>Of course the lesson went beautifully. I thought his teacher, one of three, was just the best fit for Riku's personality. She was very quiet and gentle with him, and it was obvious he trusted her and felt secure. Doug and I sat on a nearby bench at this small inside pool, and watched as he floated on his back, with his head supported, tried both water wings and fins, turned around with minimal help, and even slid off the edge of the pool, with Jennifer holding onto his hands. He told us he landed on her knee. I liked her so much that I requested her for him if she is available for any of his other classes. I hope this happens. </p>
<p>At the end of the class, the three children had a couple of minutes of free time, tossing a ball back and forth to one another. There was no other interaction at all during the class. </p>
<p>One of Riku's biggest fears is having his face underwater, but he has practiced this a bit in the tub each night here, and told me he did at home too. So, gradually, bit by bit, we hope this experience helps. His first sentence out of the water today was "That was <strong>fun</strong>!" He was pleased to know he was going to go again in three more days. Whew! </p>
<p>On the way home, Doug asked Riku if he liked doughnuts, and Riku answered that he "sort of did, if it was the kind with icing and sprinkles". So we stopped at Krispy Kreme and picked up a mini doughnut Riku chose for himself (with chocolate icing and sprinkles), two for Doug, and one for Bryn. I declined, as I would rather have chocolate. </p>
<p>I had told Riku the lesson would make him very hungry, and I guess he believed me as he ate an extra big lunch of mac' and cheese, as well as a generous plate of broccoli, and that was after the cinnamon toast he ate on the way home! </p>
<p>He was anxious to play with Kai again today, but he's at a summer camp program each afternoon until 3:45. However, I called his mom and we arranged to meet at the park at 4:15 for a short playtime. Riku and I had a leisurely stroll over there, stopping in to say hello to Lily first. She noticed Riku was taller, and thought he looked slimmer too. They were happy to see each other and shared a big hug. </p>
<p>Riku and I discovered the playground is closed for two days for cleaning and some reconstruction, so we waited for Kai at his house, and they both decided they wanted to come back here to play. They ran and laughed all the way home, hiding from me in the most obvious spots, and then just howling when I pretended to be scared when they jumped out at me. Once here, they shot some basketballs in the back garden, and had a snack. The hour and twenty minutes went by quickly, and Doug dropped Kai off at home at 5:30, on his way to his class.</p>
<p>I got Riku right into the tub, and he was singing and playing in there happily when Bryn came home. He filled daddy in on the swimming lesson, and ate another really good-sized meal tonight. I had a fresh fruit bowl sprinkled with crushed flax seed for my dinner, and Riku "snuck" a couple of strawberries during his meal. After dinner, he asked if he could have that for dessert. I don't think there are too many six year olds who would consider this a treat. Both Bryn and Doug would have turned it down, but I told Riku all of my sisters would like it too. He decided Sean would too, as we were talking today about how Sean is very healthy and takes good care of himself. </p>
<p>Riku had the donut first for dessert but decided after he ate it that he really would have liked maybe just half of it, and I have a feeling he is going to turn down the offer to stop the next time. He's just not a sweets eater ... ice cream isn't even a treat for him, and it wasn't for his cousin Bryn either. They may be the only two children I know who don't like ice cream! </p>
<p>Bryn was home for dinner and part of the evening with us, went off to visit Soo, and then spent some time with Sean and Bern after that. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep just after 8 P.M. tonight, and I am heading up now for bed at 11 o'clock, having accomplished absolutely nothing tonight, unless I count working three sudoku puzzles. Ah well, some days are just like that ... lazy lazy for some reason. Yawn! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/an_unhurried_day.html">An Unhurried Day and a Cook in the House</a></h2>
								<p>Today was a perfect day all 'round. The sun was shining and the day warm from the moment we woke up; Sutro Tower was clearly visible, which is always a good sign from Riku's point of view (it means it could be an Ocean Beach day), and we had nothing on our agenda but the Bay Area Discovery Museum in Marin County. </p>
<p>Riku had French toast for his "second" breakfast with Bryn, and drew a robot picture at the table before getting on with his day. I would like nothing more than a picture a day, but it doesn't always happen. </p>
<p>We didn't have to rush to get out of the house, and so he had time to look at some magazines while I packed up a few snacks. He also helped me make my bed this morning, smoothing out his side of it very carefully, and placing the pillows in exactly the same way I did on my side. Riku likes to be given little chores to do, and later today he helped out too.</p>
<p>Before we left, Riku asked for a bowl of pineapple and strawberries, with "sprinkles" on them, meaning the crushed flax seeds. He really really likes this, and told me he was going to ask for this at home in Japan too. </p>
<p>We spent four hours at the museum today, and it could not have been better. I didn't once have to suggest that we move on to something else, knowing we had lots of time to just meander. Of course he headed straight for the boat and found lots of other children interested in pretending they were sinking, or that they had spotted sharks and whales. </p>
<p>Riku wanted to eat our lunch outside at the picnic tables today. It's often too cool and/or windy out there, but the weather co-operated today. While I was waiting for our snacks and beverages, Riku had to wash his hands, and for the first time ever I let him go off to the restroom on his own. We had just been there, and he was fine with leaving me in line, returning shortly, and happy with his independence. </p>
<p>He ate a great lunch, and I bought him a bag of "Pirate Booty" as always for the ride home. </p>
<p>We meandered everywhere ... up to ring the bell, through the twig house maze, back to the boat, and today spent quite a bit of time in the craft area where he made a butterfly for the kitchen window. He window-painted too, as there were no other children there when we first went in. It is usually so crowded that he hadn't bothered with it the last couple of times we were there. </p>
<p>They had a wonderful exhibit in the big hall, of the lives of Chinese children, put together by the Boston Museum. There were hands-on exhibits, and buttons to push to listen in English, Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish. Riku chose the Chinese every time, and in the "language" area, repeated all the words as he heard them, except for one very long sentence. He gathered together pretend Chinese food for me in the kitchen area, and we saw several videos of the children introducing their parents, and watched them cooking & planting rice, and sitting down for a family meal. There was also a little Chinese theatre stage set up, and Riku donned a costume, wrapping it around himself so that he could appear as a scary figure alongside the two little girls all done up in the pretty costumes they had put on. This was so much fun and we spent a good deal of time in that area. </p>
<p>Once we had finished, Riku decided it was time to leave for home. Of course we stopped in at the gift shop, where he chose ten pieces of shiny "jewels" in a small velvet bag, Instead of watching the three pennies I gave him for the spinning circle spin down and into the base, he let them all go, one by one, caught them, and put those in the bag too! He sat happily in the back seat, eating his cheese popcorn, finishing off the grapes, and most of the cherries we had taken along for snacks. </p>
<p>We arrived home at 4:15 and I decided to make a cream soup with the asparagus Susan had left for us. As I snapped the first stalk, I thought Riku might enjoy helping, and I was so glad I asked. He was a big help to me, snapping all the stalks just right, then trimming off the ends for the garnish, and cutting the remaining stalks into one inch pieces. He  was very careful with the knife and I left him to it, after watching him make the first few cuts. When that was all done he got up on a chair, stirring the veggies for ten minutes, and then carefully stirring again, once the hot milk was added. He's very patient when doing this step, much to my surprise.There was only a half recipe, but Bryn, Riku, and I all had a bowl, and Riku asked for more of the steamed tops to be added to his bowl. He ate every single bite, and told me after dinner that he wants to help me with dinner every night. I shall try to make sure I make dishes that give him something to do; the world can use more men who like to cook! </p>
<p>Riku had his tub, spent some time reading in the living room, and then asked for another bowl of fruit with flax seeds. We were in bed reading Shel Silverstein at 7:45. He had a busy active day and was asleep shortly after 8, after asking me what our plans were for tomorrow. I think if Sutro Tower is visible in the morning, we might just head out for an Ocean Beach day. </p>
<p>Bryn spent the evening at home with us, working, and heading off to bed early. I'm off too! </p>
<p>Oh, nice surprise in the fridge this morning, as last night Soo gave Bryn a very large portion of a tofu and fresh vegetable dish that I was always very fond of. She is coming over next week to make some special dishes for Bryn and Riku (likely a meatball clay pot dish), and some vegetarian potstickers for us too. Lucky us! </p>

<p>Riku first snapped the asparagus at just the right place, then trimmed the asparagus tips, followed by careful chopping of the stems into one inch pieces. Once it was all chopped, he helped stir and cook it, and then came the final step... tasting. He liked it a lot! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/a_day_in_the_hood.html">A Day in the Hood</a></h2>
								<p>Potrero Hill, that is! Riku and I had hoped for an Ocean Beach day today, especially after our gorgeous day yesterday, but it was not to be. The fog didn't lift until after 3 o'clock, and Sutro Tower was hidden in clouds just an hour and a half later. So, we stayed in our own neighbourhood, which worked out well, as we did some fun and varied things today. </p>
<p>I pulled out my old copy of Shel Silverstein's book called "Uncle Shelby's ABZ Book", a very quirky, silly, and often outrageous book. It is really an adult book, but has just enough silly bits that Riku really got a kick out of it. There are some pages that are just too old for him to understand the humour, and I passed by others that would have required far too much of an explanation for him right now. Some are just inappropriate for young children, but the ones he "got" really had him laughing out loud. Doug sat with him a little later on, talking about some of the pages he had already seen and heard, and I snapped a photo of the two of them. </p>
<p>While I did the ironing this morning, and got a couple of emails written, Doug and Riku went to the library in the Mission District to pick up  a few books for Riku, eight in total. There is a book about baby spiders, Shel Silverstein's "The Missing Piece", "A World Full of Monsters" to read to me, a book called "Earthquake" by a Chinese author, another about the human body, with lots of illustrations, another to read to me, called "Sheep Blast Off!", "Baby Beluga" to read/sing to me, and the one we started reading/looking at/discussing tonight about volcanoes ... a nice varied lot of reading for him to choose from over the next week or so. </p>
<p>Riku is enjoying access to my computer and now is able to find his own way to his "favourites" site list (he was starting to do this before moving to Japan), and can easily pick and choose which one of the many choices he has open to him. Today he logged on to the Crayola site, and started filling in an online form! I gave him a pretend email address, after he asked me what his was, and he filled in our phone number, gave the name of a friend, and asked for our address.</p>
<p>He also said he was working on his blog, making Doug and I both smile, and tapped a few lines to his dad on IM too. He knows how to expand the screen now too, and finished up his computer time by making a painting using the Jackson Pollack site. Fun for him, and fun to watch him navigate his way through it all too. </p>
<p>After lunch, I dropped Doug and Riku off at the "playground at the top of the hill", while I went off to Rainbow for groceries on my own. Just over an hour later I joined them, and found Riku playing with Daisy, a little girl from the second grade one class at "Starr King", his former school. Doug said Riku was very happy to see her arrive, with her mom and siblings, and they played together until they left.It turns out there is a small reunion picnic on Saturday for old and new students in the Chinese program, so we may join in on that after Doug's class. Daisy's mom, Meg, sent me the information on this, and also said they would very much like to have Riku over to play one afternoon.  </p>
<p>"Spiderman" arrived in the mail today as expected, from Netflix, and Riku was very keen to see it. So I made a hearty snack for him, and a hot cup of tea for me along with some guacamole and crackers for my lunch. We sat together and watched the first forty-five minutes of it; Riku has such a hearty laugh and obviously was enjoying it!  He was so good about not complaining about having it interrupted so soon, but I had promised him we could cook again today, so he was looking forward to that too. </p>
<p>He sat and drew a picture of Spiderman while I got out all the ingredients for "Signal Hill Gingerbread Cake", an old favourite from years ago in Ontario. Riku was just so happy to be baking again, as over the years we have spent quite a bit of time in the kitchen baking together. He remembered just how to level off the flour and baking soda and spices with the flat of a knife, and how to crack an egg too. He did make funny references to how the batter looked, especially after he had added the molasses ... "vomit" was his chosen word, although "nasty" came up as well, when the egg was first added.  </p>
<p>Soon the cake was in the oven, and Riku was back to his drawing until dinner was ready. Bryn came in much later from work tonight, after a couple of phone meetings, but was home in time to sit with Riku at the table, listen to his stories about his day, and talk about the photos about Pompeii at length. </p>
<p>Riku is a little worried about his swimming lesson tomorrow; even though he enjoyed it on Monday, he now is concerned that he might have to jump in the water. I think he finally accepted it will be fine. Bryn gave him a little talk about not worrying about things before they happen, as often it ends up not being anything to worry about at all. It's a hard lesson to learn for sure. </p>
<p>Riku told me this morning that he didn't wake up in the night at all, did waken when the big hand was at the 9 (quarter to seven), but did what I asked him to, and turned on the light to read. I heard a small noise just five minutes later, likely him getting a book out to read, as that was what he was doing when I joined him for our morning snuggle. He just lit up when I walked in the room; what a greeting! </p>
<p>Today, as we were at the front window waiting to wave goodbye to his dad, Riku wrapped his arm around my neck, put his face close to mine and said "I love your cheeks, Nana, 'cause they are soft, and I love your neck, and your shoulders, and your back, because they are soft <strong>and</strong> warm. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep just a minute or two after 8 P.M. again tonight. </p>
<p>p.s. Riku occasionally will ask me to take a photo of him and then strike a pose. I call this "the look" as it just makes me laugh to see it. I have included one today. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/another_successful_swimming_le.html">Another Successful Swimming Lesson</a></h2>
								<p>We spent a quiet morning at home today, as Riku's swimming lesson was just after lunch, and I didn't want a tuckered-out boy going for his lesson. He started to worry about it mid-morning, with tummy aches, and complaints about not wanting to go. The morning was fun for him though, as we watched the second forty-five minute segment of "Spiderman" together, he spent some time on the Internet (having figured out how to log into the craft section of the Crayola site), and then "drew" using a new program that Doug installed for him. He now knows his way around his own "Riku's Favourites" on my desktop, so he can just go through all the various bits we have added to it over the past few years. He even dragged one into the "trash" following my instructions. </p>
<p>He helped Doug put away the large supplies of toilet paper and tissues this morning; he loves to help and be involved and I was happy to have him opening the big packages with scissors and then deliver it all to Doug in the storage room. After it was done, he decided it would be fun to cut the plastic covering into little bits, possibly hundreds of little bits. What a mess! I told him he hadn't made that big a mess since he was one year old, and pulled out all the plastic bags from my cupboard. He had a great ol' time, and had fun flinging it all up into the air when he had finished. Of course, then he got to pick it up and realized just how many pieces he had cut! </p>
<p>He drew a great picture of various monsters today, and one day I must put up an entry or two with his latest drawings. I notice he is not using colour as much as he used to, although sometimes he will go back and colour them once he has done the major drawing in black on white paper. </p>
<p>I made corn soup for lunch today, and Riku helped me break up the kernels to add to the pot. He was sorting through his books when I began the actual cooking, so he offered to help me another day. I got big compliments on the soup, though, as he told me it was really really good, and he ate every bite without any urging. He was happy to know that his dad liked the soup when he was a little boy too. </p>
<p>Once Riku is in the pool area, his fears seem to abate, or at least he has decided there is no point in talking about it! He watches the other swimmers carefully, and once his name is called he is up and on his way to the far end of the pool area. Taryn was Riku's swimming instructor today and again he lucked out, as both Doug and I felt she did a great job. I put in a request for her, and Jessica is also on his "preferred" list, as one particular teacher we saw there would just not have worked for him. </p>
<p>Riku seemed to enjoy it once more, and we were so happy to see him floating more comfortably, with his head being held, and also moving on his own for the first time that we could see. They tend to stay down at the shallow end of the pool, of course, and so it's hard to see exactly what is going on. However, this little boy came bursting out of the pool telling me "That was <strong>great</strong>! </p>
<p>The instructors make notes on their file sheet after the lesson, but there is no direct contact with them at all. However, I went to check on the name of the woman whom we don't want to teach him, and his own teacher told me that Riku had done really well today. How wonderful to hear that, as it meant he has come a long way from that one lesson before. </p>
<p>This morning he told me he wanted a Krispy Kreme doughnut after swimming today, after all, as he had decided on Monday that he didn't want any more. Then before we left he told us he didn't want one, but once we got on the road he changed his mind again. When he was getting changed after his lesson he said to me "I sure change my mind a lot. First I want a doughnut and then I don't. Then I do. Then I say I don't like swimming, and then I do, and then I don't, and now I do!" At least he knows himself and can no doubt see what is going on there with the swimming especially. I'm hoping he remembers this for next Monday, so he can happily anticipate his next class. </p>
<p>We had some errands to run, and the first stop was at Krispy Kreme for that doughnut with chocolate icing and coloured sprinkles on it. We stopped at the library for Doug, although Riku and I sat in the car chatting. I want to take Riku to one of our public swimming pools in the Mission and needed to pick up their schedule. The pool is in a large playground/soccer field complex, and Riku asked if we could stay there for a while. Doug had his book with him, and we spent an hour and a bit there, watching Riku go from one area to another. </p>
<p>I realized today just how much learning Riku does by carefully observing other children. It takes some time before he decides he can do something, and I can almost see him thinking about trying it, and then he does, carefully for certain, but going for it. His cousin Bryn was and may still be still the same way. Caillie would just go for it, as does Mirei, but not these boys. Interesting to see this process. </p>
<p>Quiet time at home for the rest of the evening. Riku went through the book of the body very very carefully, page by page, asking me to explain anything that wasn't obvious to him. We talked about autopsies, and how doctors hundreds of years ago didn't used to know for sure what was inside the body. We talked about X-rays, and bones, and skeletons, until it was tub time and then dinner. He ate a huge dinner tonight, brown rice mushroom risotto, with sides of veggies, and he chose grapes for dessert. </p>
<p>Bryn was out for the evening, and didn't come home after work today, and Doug was at his class, so Riku and I had a very quiet evening, and he was tucked into bed at 7:20 tonight, with time for many pages of Shel Silverstein's poems, and some talk about hypnotism too. Riku was asleep before 8 tonight, a tired boy after the swimming and the running around at the playground. </p>
<p>(Kelly is in Nanaimo with Gail and Tom today. She flew in this morning, they had dinner out at the "Fox and Hounds" pub where I found the wonderful hard cider when we were there, and tomorrow they are off for brunch at "Penny's Palapa." I even had a little IM chat with her, a rare occurrence!) </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/bubbles_badminton_and_a_playda.html">Bubbles, Badminton, and a Playdate</a></h2>
								<p>Riku came up into our room at 7 A.M. today, on the nose. Later I asked him when he woke, and he said "at 6:30." I asked him what he did with the extra half hour and was told "I read, like you told me too, and then I tidied up a bit." That would be Riku! </p>
<p>I had a "recipe" for super bubbles that I had cut from the paper ages ago, and this morning that was our plan. Riku measured and gently stirred the mixture together in my largest bowl, and then he, Doug, and I went out to see how it worked. It was a bit tricky as there was a breeze blowing, which immediately took the bubble away, but we made up a second batch, adding more corn syrup and that made a huge difference. Doug and Riku both managed to get large bubbles in the air, although Riku at first had much more fun breaking them than making them himself. After I had taken some photos, I tried my hand at it, with the tin can as a "wand", and managed to get some very big and long bubbles in the air. Riku was delighted with the whole process and no doubt we shall do this again. </p>
<p>Once again we were hoping for an Ocean Beach day, as we could see Sutro Tower clearly when we woke up. However, I prefer going out right after lunch, as I can get a few things done in the morning, while Riku draws, and enjoys a quiet few hours after breakfast. However, we may have to rethink this, as we have yet to get to the beach! The fog came rolling in just after noon today. </p>
<p>After lunch, Riku decided that instead of driving to Stow Lake (plan number two), he wanted to go back to the playground on the hill, mostly to see if there were any friends there. Except for one child, we were the only ones there at first, but it was fun anyway. Riku swung for a bit, and then we played badminton for a long time. He took a break to play on the climbing structures, then came over to me, lay down on the bench with his head in my lap, and his hat over his eyes for a few minutes, chatting away, and then we blew some bubbles. I had taken along two small containers and the wind just picked these tiny ones up and blew them away. Back to the badminton practice, and Riku was very pleased, as he managed to hit back the birdies three times to me! He did better than I for sure. </p>
<p>Home for a fifteen-minute break, then he and Doug walked over for an hour and a half visit with Kai at his home. They played with Lego, and Riku had a great time; he and Doug walked back home together, but once here he told me that he wishes he had his own Lego here. </p>
<p>He drew two pictures for his Japanese homework requirements after dinner. Riku has been drawing regularly in a book that I bought for him in Nanaimo, and has done lots of those already, but now we need to have him concentrate on filling up 24-plus pages for his teacher. </p>
<p>Dinner, tub, a little computer time with the drawing program, and tucked in and asleep just before 8 P.M. tonight. </p>
<p>I had a long chat with one of my doula moms while Riku was at Kai's, and we made arrangements for her to come for a visit on Monday after Riku's swimming class. I'm sure he will be delighted to have a seven-month-old little fellow to coo over. </p>

<p>The Bubble Solution we used: 1/2 cup soap, 5 cups of water, and 3 tablespoons of syrup. Stir together very gently so as to create as little foam as possible. Have fun! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/slow_lazy_saturday.html">Sociable  Saturday</a></h2>
								<p>The only plans we had for today was an afternoon outing for Riku with Mari. But of course plans change and it was a fun and busier day for him than we anticipated. </p>
<p>First thing this morning, after we had some snuggling time in our bed upstairs, Riku watched a couple of Caillou segments; he told me the other day he didn't like them anymore (wanting to watch a Japanese action movie for the second or third time), but he had a grin on his face every time I peeked in on him. He almost always has his fruit bowl upstairs while I shower, and it was lovely to see that little smile while he watches something so typically Canadian. </p>
<p>Riku did two drawings for his school homework after breakfast today, he spent a little bit of time using the new drawing program on my computer, and the morning drifted by in a very leisurely manner.</p>
<p>Bryn had sent out an email yesterday to Riku's classmates' parents from Starr King, letting them know that Riku was in town and would be going to the get-together at a playground tomorrow morning. One of the children, Skyler, Riku's "crush" from school here, isn't going tomorrow but her mom suggested a playdate for today instead. Riku was a little reluctant, and said he really wanted to play with Kai instead, so a compromise was reached. Riku and Bryn walked over to the playground near Kai's home, and left a phone message saying they would be there for an hour and a bit. And to Riku's delight, Kai was there and they spent that time together. </p>
<p>I had lunch started when they arrived home just after 11:30, so there was time for a snuggle for Riku with his dad, who had his stomach gurgles listened to while lying there together. Riku, Bryn, and I sat at the table and chatted while Riku slowly ate his lunch. Riku doesn't like to rush while he is eating and we reassured him he had lots of time before Skylar arrived. </p>
<p>This is the first playdate for these children, and I think Riku wasn't sure what they would do together, but it went very well. First they went out and blew some bubbles from the mixture we made up yesterday; they took turns using the can and the wand and both made some big bubbles and tried to catch each other's as they drifted away. </p>
<p>Then they decided they wanted to go to the playground on top of the hill, so off we went. We took the badminton rackets with us, and they spent quite a long time doing that, although it was hot; at some point they got into the shade under the playground structure. They were just sitting talking, and I managed to get a few photos of them. Riku, more and more now, wants to "pose" for the photos, and is constantly striking weird and funny poses. Skylar thought this was very funny, and she copied him on one of them, but mostly smiled at his antics; I'm sure she won his heart again with this reinforcement of his talents! </p>
<p>And just as suddenly as they wanted to go to the playground, they decided they wanted to come back to the house! It's only a five-minute drive, so back we came, and they ran around the garden until it was time for Bryn to take Skylar home.</p>
<p>Oh, I overhead an amusing conversation on the way home. Riku learned some time ago about sperm and the egg, and how the sperm that reaches the egg first is the winner. I showed him a few photos of this, and often in magazines there will be a great photo of the squiggly little guys too. He finds it totally fascinating: here are bits of the conversation. "Do you know about sperm, Skylar? There are thousands of them and they are all trying to reach the egg. This is a serious race. Whoever gets to the egg first is the winner! Did you know that? And we are the winners 'cause we are alive. The losers all die, so we are lucky. But we were the fastest! Sometimes two or three all get there at the same time, so then there is more than just one baby born." I'm not sure how much Sklyar knew, but she knows more now. I did offer one more bit of information today though, and made sure he knew the sperm come from the men and the egg is in the woman.  </p>
<p>When Bryn returned home, Mari still hadn't called, so Riku and I continued to read on the sofa, going over each item on each page of the volcano book he borrowed. I'm amazed at what he remembers and what he asks; I was reading as quickly as I could to answer his questions! Riku went to the bookcase to see if he could find "The Little Prince" but came back instead with a Waldo book. We searched for Waldo for the longest time, but finally just gave up and concentrated on all the funny things we could find on each page. </p>
<p>About 3:15, Brent, Mikela, and Quentin came over to await Mari's call, and Riku was just delighted to see Quentin. He ran to his room and brought out the big basket of small cars, Bryn brought out the smaller basket containing his own wooden cars, from when he was a little guy, and Riku decided he needed a fire station and an airport too! Quentin is a sweet little guy, very interested in everything, and watched Riku closely as they played together. At one point Riku clasped Quentin's face between his hands, so very sweet with him. </p>
<p>At 4 P.M., they all headed out to a playground together and the plan was to meet Mari there, and then after a bit they all went out for sushi, to a new place in the Mission. </p>
<p>Doug and I had dinner and worked on a difficult Sudoku puzzle; with tough ones like this one, I just sit and listen to how Doug makes decisions about where the numbers go! At 6:30, Bryn walked in saying Mari and Riku would be along in ten minutes. It took them an extra twenty minutes, and it turned out it was because Mari let Riku take a <strong>lot</strong> of photos on her cell phone; she thinks maybe a hundred of them! </p>
<p>He obviously had a great time, and in the tub told me that I would really have liked the sushi as there was no meat, just delicious soup with tofu, but not so much tofu, and "salad" "'cause salads are really good for you." I'm sure he meant there were greens in the soup. He described another dish to me as well, but used Japanese words so even though he was enthusiastic about it, and thought I would be too, I have no idea what it was. </p>
<p>He was given a few minutes to show Mari the drawing program on the computer, which he demonstrated to her very well. I am so amazed at how quickly he has learned to use all the various "tools" in this program! I also told him that Mari could read one Shel Silverstein poem to him, so that was fun for them both. It was a bit of a nonsense verse, and Riku had to help with a couple of the words, which was fun to see. </p>
<p>We said goodbye to everyone... Bryn drove Mari to a friend's home, and then he and Doug went out to a movie. Riku and I read a few more pages of poems, and he was asleep at 8:10 tonight, not bad considering we had a later tub start and more distractions for him too. But, a busy day and a relaxing tub meant he drifted off very quickly. </p>
<p>I called Gail, IM'd with Kelly who had such a great day in West Vancouver, showing Gregg all the familiar places she knew growing up, and ending with a delicious dinner out, and a walk around Robson Street before bed for her. </p>
<p>All's well in my world! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/starr_king_picnic_for_riku_and.html">Starr King Picnic for Riku ... and Movie Day!</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn and Riku left the house promptly at 10 A.M. for a summer get-together for the Mandarin students at Starr King. Riku was hoping to see more of his former classmates, but only three of them, all girls (Sasha, Daisy, and Skylar), were there, and they obviously had fun as they got home more than a half hour later than it was to have ended. </p>
<p>It was a hot sunny day out there, although it was nice and cool here in the house, so I was totally unaware of it. Kelly called from Vancouver and we had a nice long chat, a rarity these days, about all that she and Gregg had seen and were planning to see in the next two days. They drove to say hello to a former neighbour, and Kelly has plans to meet up with one of my Vancouver friends tomorrow. </p>
<p>Bryn and Riku arrived home, hot and sweaty, at 12:40. Riku had his share of sunshine and heat, as had Bryn, so we decided to go off to see "Up" together. Riku just missed out by days seeing it in March. </p>
<p>Doug had taken the bus to the Four Star Theatre to see a double feature, leaving us with the car. We drove off to the Kabuki very soon after Riku had a bite to eat, and then filled up on popcorn at the theatre. Riku and I liked it more than Bryn did; Bryn thought the old man in the movie was grumpier than he should have been, given that he was such a likeable fellow all of his life. Life can take its tolls, though, and by the end he was back to his old kind self. </p>
<p>We stopped in at a big Japanese bookstore after the movie for a very thick magazine for Riku, and spotted some mochi on a stick, as well as some sticky soy delicacies, which Riku promptly ate. He sat in front of a replica of a famous Osaka castle while eating them. </p>
<p>Riku had a nice long relaxing tub before dinner tonight, a good idea on these hot days: it cools him down enough that he enjoys his dinner more. After he got his PJs on, Riku showed me a yellow metal ring he had found with his Dad, I believe. I was telling him what one did with a ring on a wedding day, saying "With this ring, I thee wed." and slipping it on his finger. He took it off and held my hand, slipping it on my ring finger and saying "With this ring, I will love you forever." Riku has such a tender heart. </p>
<p>I made up a bowl of noodles with lots of veggies in it for his dinner, which he ate while perusing his magazine.He has been declining dessert these past few days, nixing both custard and fresh fruit. I think he is just eating a lot with dinner and then realizing that he is full. </p>
<p>I put the timer on so that Riku could have fifteen minutes on the computer with his drawing program, but surprisingly he shut if off after five minutes and came and joined me on the chesterfield. I had been sorting through any of the books in the living room that might still be of interest to Riku, and so we sat and read a half dozen he hadn't seen or heard for many months. </p>
<p>I hoped to have him in bed a half hour earlier than usual, but somehow the time disappeared,and I walked out his door just after 8 o'clock as usual.</p>
<p>Bryn was just dashing out the door to see one of Doug's afternoon movies, which he especially enjoyed. It was a Japanese film ("Departures"), and won the Oscar for "Best Foreign Language Film." Bryn suggested that I join him and less than one minute later we were in the car and off to the movies! We both enjoyed it very much, although Doug was quite weepy during parts of it, and I wasn't. We all thought the acting of the entire cast was wonderful, and it was a very interesting foreign culture story. I always have questions after a movie like this, though... </p>
<p>Home at 11 P.M. and too tired to do anything but head for bed. The movie was a nice last-minute decision, though, and I'm glad I went for it. An evening movie is a rare event for me these last couple of years! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/swimming_guests_playground.html">Swimming, Guests, and the Playground</a></h2>
								<p>Riku was awake very early this morning. I have the monitor on in my room, and heard little rustling sounds at 6:10 today. It was obvious that Riku was awake, so downstairs I went and saw his face peeking out at me, with a big smile, as I came toward him. We got a nice stack of books out, and he sat looking through them while I got his fruit bowl ready. I don't know how much longer Riku will be happy cuddling up reading, but I hope for a long time yet: it's such a wonderful way to start our day. </p>
<p>Bryn had breakfast with Riku today, and then Riku watched some rarely-viewed short-story versions of two classic Hans Christian Anderson tales. I had a quick shower and we made up the bed together as has become a habit. Riku knows exactly how to place the three pillows on the side that he makes up.</p>
<p>I had to vacuum the carpet on the main floor this morning, just briefly, as there was lots of sand, including some from the various playground excursions. Riku happened to pick up one of the sofa cushions while I was in the living room, and we decided the base of the sofa seat could use a good cleaning too. I left Riku to do that while I continued on with the laundry, and he did a very thorough job of it too. He's a great little helper. </p>
<p>We were taking Kevin's car in to be serviced this morning, so off we went to do that. It was already hot out there, and if we hadn't had swimming today, and a guest coming over later, this would have been <strong>the</strong> day, at last. Riku said later on that tomorrow we <strong>would</strong> go to Ocean Beach, even if it was foggy. We're both ready for this! </p>
<p>This was Riku's third swimming lesson today, and for the first time there was not a word of protest. And he had such a successful lesson too! He dog-paddled alone for the very first time, and I wish I had been able to catch the big proud smile on his face as he paddled toward us. The instructor had asked him to swim to the rail nearest to us, but he turned and swam even further! He floated as well, although it was hard to see if the teacher was supporting him in any spot from where we were sitting. However, Bryn had asked me to sign him up for more lessons, if they were available, and so he now has five more scheduled in the next ten days. </p>
<p>We headed right home for lunch, before one of my doula moms arrived with her seven-month-old son, Daniel. I have only seen photos of him since the day after he was born; it has been hard for us to schedule a visit, and since Natallia is starting back to college next week this was our only chance. Riku and I had some quiet time before they arrived, though, which was great, as he was ready to give his attention to the baby. He's very gentle with little ones, and was happy to keep him amused. We put Daniel in his favourite position, on his tummy, and in front of the mirror on the bottom of the hearth, so he could see himself. He's darling; looks like his mommy, and is getting ready to push himself up into a crawling position. </p>
<p>Before we parted, Natallia gave me a lovely colourful tablecloth and matching napkins from her homeland, Russia. We plan to get together in October so she can meet Mirei too. By that time Daniel will be crawling and will have cut his first teeth, too. </p>
<p>We had tea and a snack and after a while all walked over to the playground so that Riku could play with Kai. They ran around, Riku spent some time flirting with Emi, Kai's one-and-a-half-year-old sister, and he did some climbing. </p>
<p>Natallia and Daniel left before we reached the house, and I popped Riku into the tub as soon as he had looked at the two new books Bryn had ordered, from a series that Susan introduced to us called "Eye Witness Books". These two are on insects and amphibians and the minute his tub was finished he was at the table going through one page after another, with lots of questions, and lots of answers too. He had initially been sorry that his Lego hadn't arrived, but after starting to go through the first one he said "Why did I say I didn't want these books? They're <strong>fabulous</strong>, his latest favourite word. </p>
<p>Bryn surprised us by showing up just as Riku was finishing his dinner. We were looking at the insect book, and Riku and Bryn continued looking through it, and then Riku told him about his swimming lesson. He also started scratching at his arms and legs, and has some kind of an allergic reaction to something he thinks he got at the playground when running through the longish grass. He thought perhaps they were insect bites, but it looks more like a fine rash. I hope the aloe gel I put on it helps. It did seem to cool it down (his skin was quite red and hot to the touch too) as he had stopped scratching at bedtime. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep before 8 o'clock tonight, just by minutes, but I do hope he sleeps in a little later tomorrow. It's a free day for us, though, with no commitments, so here's hoping for an Ocean Beach day!  </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/two_playgrounds_for_riku_today.html">Two Playgrounds for Riku Today</a></h2>
								<p>Riku and I have an understanding ... that if he wakens before 7 A.M. he will stay in his bed downstairs until that time, and then he's allowed to come up to waken me. He usually just crawls into bed with me, and I waken before he says a word. He's been great about doing this since he arrived. I have a monitor set up, though, as often I am awake by 6:30 and when I hear him moving about in his room, I come downstairs to snuggle and read with him. This morning though he came up at 6:30! I was very surprised and he whispered to me that <strong>his</strong> read 7 o'clock. Hmmm. Odd. Less than ten minutes later though, as we lay quietly not talking, he again whispered to me that he had actually moved the hands of the clock himself, and that he was sorry he did that, and that he wouldn't do it ever again. I was so proud of him for 'fessing up, and told him so. Tonight at tuck-in time he told me he would see me at 7 o'clock tomorrow morning. </p>
<p>We had so hoped for a late morning and long afternoon at Ocean Beach today, but that fog was so thick this morning we couldn't see the tiniest hint of Sutro Tower. The fog wasn't moving either, so we decided to go to the playground on the hill again, just to get out this morning, hoping that one of his old school friends was there. No such luck, but the playground was filled with mostly babies and on to perhaps five-year-olds. He and I played a little bit of badminton, but for the most part Riku played with all the little ones. </p>
<p>One very young boy took a real shine to Riku and wanted to play badminton with him, so Riku spent the longest time with him, showing him how to try to hit the ball. At one point he was surrounded by five or six children, all waiting for a turn. </p>
<p>During the time we were there, two moms came up to me at separate times to tell me how patient and gentle Riku was with their children. He truly is, and it seems to come naturally to him too, this bond he has with them. And one of the dads there played with Riku and a few of the other children too, chasing them and making them all squeal. Riku didn't want the morning to end. </p>
<p>After a later than usual lunch at home (Riku snacked on fruit and cheese and crackers at the playground), we were off to join Susan, Amelia, and Finn at the "blue" playground at Golden Gate Park. Parking was just terrible and we had to drive for quite a bit before we lucked out with someone leaving. </p>
<p>The children all had a great time on the play structure for a long time, then played hide and seek in the "forest" area, and spent a lot of time with a fabulous "rocket launcher" that Susan had with her. It was so much fun that soon there was a whole collection of boys wanting to take turns too. Amelia and Riku gave up waiting so long for their turn again and went back to climbing. </p>
<p>Finn is just a remarkably capable little climber. Like Amelia, he has no fear at all, and like her is careful too, but I was still astounded at just how dexterous he is, and how he is able to figure out for himself how to get over and/or around any situation on the tall structure they were playing on. </p>
<p>Amelia proudly showed me how she can swing across the monkey bars, skipping every other one of them! She is amazing too, and has been from the time she was such a little girl. Her hands were sore from having done this over and over again today. </p>
<p>It was still foggy, although that playground is quite protected, as we found out when we moved through a tunnel to the music concourse for the children to sit and have their snacks. I was too cold almost instantly, but Amelia, looking just as cute as can be with a new haircut (with bangs!), and Riku were very happy to just run around with Finn until it was time to leave. </p>
<p>Riku still had his rash this morning, and even though the itching seems to have pretty much stopped, the rash itself has spread. It's a strange rash, as on his arms it is quite red and fine, covering them, and yet this morning he had actual individual bumps on the fronts and backs of his legs. Tonight there were some on his feet, and later tonight on his chest and shoulders. I called the doctor in the afternoon and he called back tonight, suggesting an antihistamine, and a visit to the office if it doesn't clear up pretty much in the next day. </p>
<p>We had a great evening together. He was in the tub as soon as we got home, and ate a big dinner while he filled a page with all the letters of the alphabet, numbers to 20, and as many of the characters on the keyboard as he remembered. We played Xs and Os too, and I taught him "Sprouts" tonight. Bryn showed up as Riku was finishing his dinner, and they had some time together too. </p>
<p>Bryn went off to buy some antihistamine for Riku, which he took just before bedtime. I hope this has disappeared by morning, but somehow I don't think it's going to. The doctor thought it sounded like a contact rash, although he really hadn't played anywhere yesterday that was more than shortly mown grass. </p>
<p>Bedtime was a little later tonight, but I am hoping he sleeps until 7 tomorrow. It's a swimming day and a busy night here tomorrow night too. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/a_day_at_home_1.html">A Day at Home, Bubbles and Balls</a></h2>
								<p>Despite our best intentions, and with the exception of Riku's swimming lesson at 12:30, we ended up spending the entire day at 1361! We even had an exceptionally lazy morning: Riku had asked before bedtime last night if he could paint, and I told him he could in the morning. The minute he came up to our room, at 7:10 today, he whispered to me, asking if he could paint right away. And I gave him the answer I often get from him when I ask him a question this trip "Of course!" We came right down and he got to it, painting a big, bright, colourful, and very simple drawing. Sure brightened up my kitchen! </p>
<p>Riku ate breakfast with his dad this morning, and they had a little relaxing time together before we went to the window to wave goodbye to Bryn. Riku decides each morning which portion of a video he is going to watch while I shower, and I usually watch a bit of it with him after I finish. Today he chose "The Wizard of Oz", the original version and Doug was just coming out of the shower as I got it started. He sat with Riku "for just a little while" but ended up watching the entire movie with him! </p>
<p>The city was covered in fog this morning and we kept looking out the window, watching the city slowly emerge. By the time we left for Riku's class the day was perfect, with sunny blue skies and no wind. </p>
<p>Riku had his first male swimming instructor today; on the way in, he told me he hoped he had Jessica today (he's had her twice), but decided once we were there and saw just two teachers, that he would like to have the man. He was very pleased when he called Riku's name, and they had a good lesson, with lots of smiles. At the very end of the class, he and Riku were blowing water at each other through tubes, and we could hear Riku laughing from the other side of the pool. </p>
<p>Today Riku said he would like a Krispy Kreme doughnut, and he finished off his sandwich before we got there. He chose the same small iced doughnuts with sprinkles and ate one of them after finishing up more lunch at home. That was when he decided that he wanted to just stay home. I was packing up snacks and water for the beach trip, but he was certain about his decision. An hour later, after I got a few little chores done, I suggested we go to the playground at the top of the hill. It was quite warm out and there is always a lovely breeze there, and lots of children too, but again he said he wanted to just stay put. </p>
<p>We were expecting Soo over tonight to cook pot stickers and a hot pot for a small crowd of people ... Brent, Michela, Quentin, and Mari ... and I asked Riku to help me tidy up a bit. There was sand in the hallway from the playground yesterday and Riku maneuvered the vacuum cleaner nicely down the hall and around the corner to get all that picked up. When I took over, he decided on his own to tidy up around his desk in the kitchen, moving his backpack to his room, and even tidying out his treasure box from under his bed. At one point I found him setting the table with placemats, but I told him we would more likely just be snacking on the food as it was made, and not sitting down all at once. </p>
<p>Once we finished up, we went into the garden to sweep up a bit. Riku had been out for a bit, blowing bubbles with the big bowl of bubble mixture I had left on the table. He was blowing huge bubbles today, and multi-bubbles too, and suggested I get the camera out and try to get a photo of some of them. I did it, too, as the mixture was thicker and lasted longer today once the bubble was off the wand. One of the things he really wanted me to capture was him with a "caught" bubble on the wand, and I did it. Whew! </p>
<p>Then, as promised, we played with a ball and "catcher" set I had bought in Nanaimo. We've been doing lots of catching and throwing, as well as playing badminton, and I can see such a big improvement each time we play. And how he loves it! He will call out "You should have gotten that one!" or say "Oh, too bad, you just missed it" at other times. It's sheer pleasure to have this time with him, as there is lots of laughing going on, and lots of give and take too. He will often run for the ball even if I miss it. </p>
<p>Bryn was home at 5 P.M. and called Soo to say he was on his way to pick her up. Oops! Miscommunication, as she had changed the day to tomorrow. Bryn had to get busy calling and emailing everyone to let them know, and cancelling his dinner at Susan and Kevin's tomorrow night. I had mentioned to Bryn that Riku has a class tomorrow again, making up for a class he was to have taken a week from Friday, when they will be away. Poor Riku! He burst into tears saying he didn't want to take lessons every day, and then burst into tears again when he learned that no one was coming over for dinner tonight either! He was really upset and it took some time to calm him down. I could tell how disappointed he was about both events. He sat on my lap for the longest time, sobbing away, until he finally settled down and decided to have his tub. </p>
<p>Oh, his rash was much improved this morning, although had not disappeared completely. I spoke with Dr. Kelly this morning, who said we could give it one more day and see if it was much improved before deciding to bring him in. He would have seen him this morning, but Riku hadn't been scratching it since the night before last. Fingers crossed that it goes away completely by tomorrow. </p>
<p>We had a lovely dinner together, as we played so many paper games ... our own version of Xs and Os, which we played yesterday, then Riku remembered that we hadn't played "Hangman" this trip, so we had a few goes at that too. I did really badly at it ... one of his words was "Dyment" and I never did guess it. Riku even gave me a chance at a second noose set-up, but to no avail. I lost my head! </p>
<p>Two funny things tonight from Riku. Just as he finished dinner, I asked him what he would like for dessert and the choices were his second tiny doughnut or some fruit. He chose the fruit saying "I don't think I should have a doughnut before bedtime. I will save it for tomorrow." His eyes lit up though when he saw my chocolate covered coconut ice cream bar, and I offered him a bite. He said that he didn't think it was a good idea to have that either, but he might have some tomorrow instead. What he wanted and got was a "big bowl of strawberries." </p>
<p>While he was finishing those up, he got down from the table and started looking through Doug's basket where he keeps his stack of reading material. I asked Riku what he was looking for and this was his answer "Oh, I think I am growing up quickly now because I read magazines, and I work on my blog."! He didn't spend much time on the computer at all today, drew perhaps for ten minutes, but he did fill out one of the forms again on the colouring site, asking me again for his email address which he carefully hunt and pecked out. It was rikudyment@gmail.com and he is getting used to typing it now. What a funny little guy he is! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/a_quiet_day_and_then_party_tim.html">A Quiet Day and Then ... Party Time!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku had his swimming lesson booked for noon today, so we spent a quiet morning at home. Bryn didn't have to go dashing off to work, so he and Riku sat at the table together eating breakfast and I joined Riku later on. He was drawing while I read the paper, and he asks the same question... "What's happening?" So we talk about wars, and fires, and good people and bad people. While I showered Riku watched the end of the "Dumbo" video, and then the rest of the morning flew by. He rediscovered his wooden box filled with lots of shells, so he cleared and cleaned that out, admiring his favourites again. He asked me to please never get rid of that box with the shells as it is very special for him, but he wants it at my house. </p>
<p>We sat and looked for Waldo together before lunch too, a very favourite pastime just now. </p>
<p>Today Riku's instructor was Taryn, and he decided that she was his favourite so far. He always finishes off with a huge smile, as he comes out of the pool, but we can often hear him chatting in the pool too. </p>
<p>I caught sight of a fish and chips shop yesterday, and so today Doug walked over and put in an order to go. We came right home, and Riku really loved the fish. He made lots of comments about how good it was, and we all enjoyed it. The fries were good but Riku was happy with just the fish, and asked if we could have that again really soon.  </p>
<p>It was too foggy again for Ocean Beach but gorgeous here, so Riku suggested a trip to the playground at the top of the hill again. It was very quiet, to our surprise, but we wanted to play badminton anyway, so that was fine. Eventually another boy showed up, and he and Riku played for a bit, but Riku really just me to hit the birdie to him, to give him a better chance of returning it. I suggested going to another playground too, where we didn't have to worry so much about hitting the ball so hard, but after the hour there, Riku was ready for something else. </p>
<p>We decided to have a gelato at the old spot on 22nd Street, and that was a hit for sure. He chose chocolate, to my surprise (not vanilla or coconut) and we sat outside checking out the big steeple on the nearby Chinese temple on the corner, and watching the world go by. We had driven along Mission Street at one point, and Riku commented about how noisy and busy it was, and he doesn't like that so much. He likes things a little more quiet, unless they are people he knows and is involved with, as proved the point later on! </p>
<p>Riku was delighted to find some mail for him waiting at home, a postcard from Auntie Kelly from Vancouver. Before getting back to his shells, he read the whole card on his own. </p>
<p>Tonight is the night that Soo came over to cook dumplings and a meatball dish for some of Bryn's friends... Sean, Judy, Bern, Brent, Mykela, and Quentin. Earlier in the day I wasn't sure if anyone was coming but Soo, but that changed thank goodness, as Riku was so disappointed last night. Bryn and Soo arrived at 6 P.M. and the others drifted in after that. Sean arrived first and Riku was so pleased to have him to himself for a bit; he showed his some whale shots he has on his "favourites" list, and that he can now access without any help. He did insist that we gather 'round to ooh and ahh over the photos. "Isn't that just <strong>gorgeous</strong>?", and "Aren't sunsets sooo beautiful?", Riku commented, also making sure to ask each of us which was our favourite photo. I liked one with a full moon and lots of blue in the sky, and Riku agreed "that is a beautiful one!" </p>
<p>Sean suggested that he and Riku sit at the table and draw, so they did that, and eventually we had six chairs around the little kitchen table, with everyone drawing. It was lots of fun and Riku was in his glory for the entire evening.He loves adult company, and is in his element. Meanwhile, Soo was busy at the counter making dozens of potstickers, none sadly were vegetarian. She brought along the meatball dish that Bryn had requested, and everyone sat at the dining room table, eating happily. Bryn dashed out for some beer, Riku joined in at the table, although he had eaten his dinner, and had his tub, before everyone arrived. </p>
<p>It was a very late night for Riku. At 9:10 I told him he had to say goodnight to everyone, and then he said "How about a picture of everyone first?" Is this my grandchild? Yes! It was such fun that he suggested it, and we got two really fabulous photos of everyone but Bryn! We should have done one before Brent, Mykela, and Quentin left too, but we will no doubt be together again before Bryn and Riku leave. </p>
<p>Riku settled down very quickly, after hugging everyone goodbye. He could hear them in the hallway, but after two Shel Silverstein poems, he was right into our bedtime routine, and he fell asleep with his arm wrapped around my neck. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/post_9.html">NOT an Ocean Beach Day!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku's swimming lesson today wasn't until 3:30, and so we had a perfect day planned for us. A quiet early morning at home, and then off we would go to Ocean Beach for some sand time and a picnic lunch. The weather seemed to be co-operating as the fog was lifting nicely from the time we woke until we left. Way back on Fulton Avenue, I could see white caps, not a good sign at all, and I was right. We pluckily made our way to the beach anyway, with sand toys and our lunch, but we had to huddle near the wall, or get too much sand blown our way, and after a not-very-comfortable few bites, we moved down a bit to play. But we only lasted about a half hour, and Riku suggested we go for a milkshake instead! </p>
<p>Even there we didn't have any luck, at least not our plan to sit and look at the beach from the cozy booths at Louis' diner. It was very busy and they have a $10 minimum spending limit on the booths when they are busy. Their "cash only" policy did us in, and so we ordered one vanilla shake to go, which Riku and I shared on our way to the lovely calm non-windy little lake just up the road a bit. We had been there twice before and Riku was happy to just walk along the pathways, counting the wildlife ... mostly ducks and squirrels today, and admiring the huge dragon flies hovering above the water. </p>
<p>I had forgotten my camera for the first time this trip, so missed some lovely shots. We were home at 2:30, time for a leisurely hearty snack for Riku before his class. Bryn had ordered a couple of Lego kits for Riku and they arrived today! It couldn't have been better timing, as he had time to get started on the plane kit before we left for his lesson.</p>
<p>Josh was his instructor again today, and they had a good time, ending the session by blowing water from the noodles on one of the other teachers. We came right home today, no stop for doughnuts, but time for searching for Waldo with Doug, a long warm tub, and then dinner and Lego building right up to bedtime at 7:20. </p>
<p>We had time for lots of stories, and yet Riku had a little trouble falling asleep tonight. I had hoped he would have an extra fifteen minutes or so, but I just told him to relax and not worry about falling asleep, and walked out the door at the usual 8 P.M. </p>
<p>I was very tired tonight, much more so than usual, but of course didn't want to give up the time to catch up on emails, and some family tree work too. I think it might have had something to do with my tasty glass of hard cider from Nanaimo too, as I was soooo relaxed. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/dracula_playdates_and_lego.html">Dracula, Playdates, Lego, and Ghosts ... Busters, That Is!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku came bouncing into our room this morning, cuddled up under the warm blankets and told me he had the <strong>best</strong> dream last night. He was a vampire and it was <strong>fun</strong>! I told him to stay away from my neck, and he thought that was the funniest thing to say. It's so easy to make Riku laugh; the sillier the better for him. He was anxious to get back to finishing off his Lego plane, so he sat at the table busy with that until every piece was in place. This kit had over 280 pieces, and he placed each one himself, following the manual with no assistance at all.  He has done bigger ones than this, he told me, but we are certainly impressed with his ability to sit with it on his own and just do it.</p>
<p>Riku has to turn in one drawing for each day of his vacation time; talk about the perfect homework assignment for this boy! Today he did two, before spending some time with me finding Waldo, praising me when I found one he hadn't seen before. It's fun sitting side by side, searching out Waldo, and his girlfriend, their dog, the "bad guy", the Wizard, and three tiny tiny bits that Riku has only twice managed to find ... me, never ... a bone, a stack of plates, and a scroll. It's almost impossible to find them, but the searching together is a treat. <br />
 <br />
Kai's father had emailed last night, asking if Riku and Kai could get together today. Riku decided he did not want to meet at Kai's playground, determined that he picked up his rash there, so they went to a different playground instead. He skipped all the way to Kai's house, chatting away happily. They spent two hours there, and Riku came home looking happy and well exercised at 12:30. </p>
<p>His swimming class today was at 1:30, so he had an hour and a bit to relax and eat lunch. He started a new Lego set, this one of three various houses. First he put together a tiny little table set for lunch, and called me in to see it. He had lunch in the dining room, while he continued working on it, right 'til the last minute. </p>
<p>Bryn came with us to the pool today, and watched Riku with Pam, a new instructor. Riku continues to smile away all through his lessons, and we all liked the way Pam was with him during his class. He is going to have her again tomorrow. We stopped for two mini doughnuts at Riku's request, and Bryn decided to treat himself to a burger at "In-and-Out Burger", an old favourite spot for take-out. </p>
<p>Riku had more Lego time at home, and about a half hour of "The Ghost Busters", a movie he had asked us to get for him. We rented it from Netflix and it arrived today, much to Riku's delight. He and Doug watched a half hour of it, before going with Bryn for a visit with Amelia, Finn, Susan, and Kevin. He had a little telephone chat with Auntie Susan beforehand too. </p>
<p>The time flew by quickly, as it no doubt did for Bryn and Riku too. They had Amici's pizza for dinner, watched part of "Scooby-Doo", played, and arrived home at 7.</p>
<p>Doug and I had a quiet dinner together; I answered emails about the family tree, and chose some photos for the blog. However, the doorbell rings, and, always, there stands Riku with a big smile for me. Life is good! </p>
<p>I saw some really sweet photos of Mirei today and yesterday; she is looking more grown up, of course, and I can't wait to see her in October. </p>
<p>Caillie arrives in just five days and we are looking forward to having her here with us for two weeks. </p>
<p> Riku had a nice deep tub, playing with his newly found monsters. As I was drying him off, he put his hands together, as if praying, and said solemnly "I wish I could dream about being a vampire again." ...  and then ended his day with a little bit more time for Lego, of course! </p>
<p>We are still reading Shel Silverstein's "Falling Up", but we are close to the end of the book. Soon time to choose our next one! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/a_laidback_lazy_sunday.html">A Laid-Back Lazy Sunday</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke at 6:30 this morning and crept downstairs, with a feeling that Riku was awake. He was, sitting in bed, covered up in his duvet, working on a book of puzzles that he got on the plane on the way here. It was pretty cute seeing him with his pencil in hand, doing the mazes and counting the various icons on the pages. He sat and worked at them a little longer, while I sat beside him, but soon we were up for his fruit bowl at the table. </p>
<p>Riku likes to dress right away, as the mornings are chilly, and I have been throwing his clothes in the dryer for two minutes so he gets warm quickly. He just wears boxer shorts and a T-shirt to bed, and there's not much fat on his little body to keep him warm. Anyway, he loves the warmth of the clothes in the morning as much as he does his two big warm towels after his bath. I won't be spoiling him like this very often, and it's something he tells me is one of his favourite things when he is at our house. </p>
<p>He was anxious to watch the rest of his movie, but had his fruit bowl, and then a slice of French toast with maple syrup, something he likes and hasn't had very often here anyway. It's filling and tasty and good for him too, and a nice change. He's a little tired of the same ol' egg in one form or another every day, and at least this way it seems like something different to him. </p>
<p>I asked him to do two drawings for school before he watched the movie, and he got right down to it. He has to put his name in Japanese on the back of each drawing and today he put his name in a scroll. Doug asked him how he learned to make scrolls and he said he just remembered that was how to do them. They say "Goda Riku".  </p>
<p>I sat beside him putting nice points on his big box of pencil crayons, and we chatted away as always. I had my breakfast and then we went up to watch "GhostBusters" together until Doug finished up his meal. I left them to watch the rest of it while I took a long hot shower. </p>
<p>Riku had his swimming lesson at 1 o'clock today, although I thought it was a half hour earlier. Bryn went off to find something for his lunch while we waited, and Riku and I played our version of tic tac toe. Doug kept busy the last ten minutes trying to get the tie back in Riku's swimsuit. He almost made it, but the swimming lesson isn't so rigourous that he was going to lose his suit anyway! He had Pam again today, and as Bryn had requested when he went in, Riku spent a few minutes without his goggles on, putting his face in the water, as he will have to do this in Japan. </p>
<p>After a half hour at home with his Lego, Riku went with Bryn to Japantown for an hour and a half, walking around and taking a look at the new big center that has just opened there. I made a hot cup of tea, did some family tree work, answered a few emails, and the time flew by. Riku had a new magazine to read, and a big plastic cloth with lots of things to look at on it, and he got right up on the table to really check it out.Bryn snapped a photo of it, as it's not something he has ever done before. </p>
<p>Doug and Bryn went out for some fruit and veggies, and I made dinner while Riku had his bath. He asked Bryn if he could eat upstairs watching a movie; Bryn told him it was up to me, and how could I possibly refuse? It's the first time we've done this since he arrived, so off the two of us went with our dinners ... a Mexican casserole I used to make many years ago when Kelly and Bryn were still living at home ... and watched "The Swan Princess." It ended right at bedtime, not ideal, but Riku was great, and was asleep as usual at 8 P.M. after finishing the last few poems in his book. Riku was pretty excited that we finished it, too, so tomorrow we will choose another for our bedtime routine. </p>
<p>Doug and Bryn had gone off to a movie ("District 9") about aliens in South Africa, and I had a very quiet evening at home. Bedtime early for me!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/a_morning_playdate_and_a_quiet.html">A Morning Playdate and a Quiet Afternoon</a></h2>
								<p>I heard Riku on the monitor at 6:40 this morning, chatting happily away to himself, and so came down and joined him in his bed. He didn't want to eat right away, but wanted to "just talk", so talk we did. He was disappointed that he didn't have a dream about being a vampire, and hoped he might tonight. </p>
<p>Somewhere, somehow, Riku has heard about heaven, and we have been discussing it now and then. However, today at breakfast he went into lots of detail about how nice it would be if it such a place really existed. The other day, after he had expressed his concern about my dying, and was talking about heaven, I told him I would meet him there. He was quick to point out that <strong>he</strong> would meet <strong>me</strong> there! </p>
<p>Today's scenario was quite elaborate. We will live together in a huge house with a big porch (this boy knows me well!), and with many rooms (one filled with Lego, one with treasures, mostly made of gold and silver). I hope there are cleaners in heaven 'cause cleaning this big place is <strong>not</strong> my idea of heaven at all! We decided wings would be fun, and we would both have "those gold rings around our heads" ... halos of course for both of us(!), we could listen to quiet music "not too loud 'cause I don't really like loud places", and on we went with our plans. </p>
<p>Riku has been wanting to have Amelia and/or Finn here for ages, but his mid-day swimming lessons, Amelia's busy summer camp and summer plans with family have made this hard to arrange. I promised him in bed last night that I would ask, and so it came to be this morning. Susan had been planning to head down the coast to the tide pools again today, as they had such fun there yesterday, but the fog was thick this morning, and it was quite cool near the water. Kevin dropped the children off, and they all had such a good time together. </p>
<p>Amelia and Riku played with the stuffed animals in the living room, doctoring them all very nicely with blankets, medicine, bandages, and cuddles. Finn, meanwhile, was building up a storm with the Tinker Toys. He's good at this, and accidentally knocked over the tallest one he made before I could get a photo of it. They went on to play outdoors for a bit, with the riding toys and bubbles, and then spent some time upstairs with the toys in our room. </p>
<p>The two older ones had to be reminded once in a while to include Finn, and they listened and did so. They were happy, though, when he got distracted with the cars and found a motorcycle amongst them, so that they could get on with their "science experiment", Riku's latest hobby.<br />
He has been making coloured water in plastic containers, waving his markers around in them until just the right colour emerges, and then freezing them. Sometimes cooking oil or bits of food, or sparkles from the craft drawer get added first. Then he finds a flat spot in the freezer and checks up on them now and then to see how they look. Breaking them up a bit at a time with a fork, and then refreezing them is part of the process too, and today Amelia was walked through it step by step. It was fun for her too, and she was going to try to do some at home. </p>
<p>The children had lunch together here, and then we were all off to our various afternoon activities. Riku had a <strong>great</strong> swimming lesson today, the best yet, with Pam again for the second time in a row. She's terrific, and he had his head underwater to the count of ten today, even though she asked him to go to three! He swam independently for a few strokes too, but I know he wouldn't do that without someone right there. It's been a big help for him, though, and I am planning on going swimming with him and Caillie at our local pool, just for some casual water play. He decided today would be a "two glazed doughnuts at the doughnut place" so we made a stop at Krispy Kreme. Doug suggested to Riku that they go to "Bob's" doughnut shop one day together, as they are his favourite local doughnuts. The two small ones are perfect for Riku right now, though, as he wouldn't eat one big one. It's surprising that he eats them at all, as sweets are not his favourite thing at all. I'm sure it's a passing phase and special because it comes as a special treat for him and his Grandpa.</p>
<p>We then all went off to Costco to pick up some fruit and a few extra things. Riku wanted to sit in the buggy, surprisingly, which was fine, as we didn't have much to get and got out faster than we had planned to. We had time for a stop at the library, and he and Doug came out with two new Shel Silverstein books, and a stack of others. One is all about pillbugs, which is great, as Riku finds lots of them in the garden and no doubt will learn even more about them now. </p>
<p>Riku and I both wanted to go to a playground, but he worked on his Lego house while I unpacked the groceries. He helped me do this, putting away the four pounds of butter in the freezer, and making room for the apples and blueberries.  While I did the rest, he decided he would make me a card, half of which he finished (the front of it, which he carefully covered so I couldn't see it until tomorrow when he does the inside).Riku spotted a deck of cards while he was working on the card, so we made up a game that gave two cards to whomever had the higher of the two as we placed them down together. It both cards matched, then we played another card and winner took all. Riku won the first game by a long shot, and then I won a game and he won the last of them. It was fun and I should pull out more card games for us.</p>
<p>By this time,  it was too late for the playground and instead we spent a half hour in the garden with the ball and "catching" mitts. I am not sure what they are called but Riku is getting better at throwing and catching and so am I! </p>
<p>We also had made plans to make a carrot cake tonight, but ran out of time and decided it would be a great early morning project instead. </p>
<p>Bryn came in just as I was leaving to run the tub, so they played for a bit, followed by Riku's bath, then dinner. I read a bit of one of the Shel Silverstein books to him, and while I tidied up after dinner, Bryn asked and answered questions about pillbugs (I bet you didn't know they can live to be five years old, but, sadly, usually don't).</p>
<p>We had decided on one last game of cards (Riku won), and then it was time for our bedtime routine. Riku was asleep at 7:55 tonight and made me promise, as always, that I would check on him at my bedtime and make sure that he was covered up. </p>
<p>Bryn was home for the evening, working in his room, and I wrote to Uncle Frank who is back online on his own computer after four month absence. It is so good to see those "Frank Massard" emails coming in again! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/a_busy_day.html">A Busy Day For All</a></h2>
								<p>What a busy day for Riku this ended up being! It started off slowly, with a long snuggle in bed, and with Grandpa finding him under the blankets, a favourite activity from when Riku was just two years old. We both hide under the cover, Doug goes off hmm-m-ming out loud about where Riku could be. Riku giggles away, but not too loudly, and then breaks in to such huge gales of laughter when Doug "discovers" him. </p>
<p>I had sent Akane an email yesterday letting her know that Riku was hoping to talk with her; it didn't work out for yesterday but when we finally came into the kitchen at 7:30, there was a message waiting from Akane on Skype. I rang through right away and Riku had a long chat with her and some time with his Uncle Masu as well. It is fun to hear him speak only in Japanese, except for the odd English word. He proudly showed off his Lego plane and showed them both the new house set too, not yet completed. </p>
<p>Akane had her hair cut yesterday, and now instead of down her back to her bottom it is about shoulder length. I just saw it briefly but it looks great on her. Riku noticed right away, and commented on it too. </p>
<p>While he was chatting, I cut the fresh pineapple up so that Riku could have it with his usual strawberries and banana as requested. He had some time with Bryn at the table, and  did his two daily drawings before we headed upstairs for him to watch Pingu, and for me to shower. </p>
<p>There is no swimming class today or tomorrow, so he and Doug went off to the Exploratorium at 11 A.M., taking along a picnic lunch with them. I expected they would be gone for perhaps two or two and a half hours, but they were away for three and a half hours! Riku spent a long time at a ball table, with the balls spinning around like the pennies do at the BADM. Funny that held his interest for so long, but he was enthusiastic about the giant bubbles too, and had fun at a sand drawing table too. </p>
<p>I had packed a picnic lunch for them, which they ate in the car before going to the library and then on to a playground downtown, which they hadn't been to before. Riku was hoping to get one or two more "Find Waldo" books at the main branch, but apparently they are in great demand. However, he has a nice stack of new books to go through. </p>
<p>I got through a huge number of emails today, and did some tidying up. The house looks fine considering how little time I am spending on it, but it was great to get a few extra things done too. I also just sat, with a hot cup of tea, and completed two Sudoku puzzles. I felt so much better about having caught up with the emails that were causing me to feel most guilty about, and even though there are lots more to do, I was very happy with what I accomplished in all. </p>
<p>I hadn't packed any fruit for Riku at lunch, not expecting them to be away for so long, so Riku sat down for a snack when they came in at 3:30, and then we got busy making that carrot cake we had planned to do yesterday. It was as much fun as always. Riku is very confident about his baking skills now, remembering how to flatten off the dry ingredients with the flat side of a knife, and cracking eggs easily, although still not liking the gooey whites on his hands. We make a good team as he does a great job at adding and stirring, which gives me time to put everything away and do some washing up. Riku is funny and makes me laugh, reminding me more and more of his cousin Bryn with the faces he pulls and the poses he puts on for me. </p>
<p>Just as we were finishing up the cake, Riku suggested we make corn soup for dinner. Hmm, no fresh corn, so he decided we should make some other kind of soup. And eat it in the dining room. A fancy dinner. And we could serve wine to Grandpa, and his Dad, and me too. When I told him that Grandpa didn't drink wine, and that his Dad might prefer beer, he decided we would all have water instead. We have a little socialite on our hands. He does love a gathering of kindred folk, does our boy! I did tell him that we would pick up some fresh corn and make it again soon. </p>
<p>Doug had picked up some breaded fish especially for Riku yesterday, and so he had that for dinner, along with some small Yukon Gold potatoes, and mixed veggies. He ate every bite of the two wedges of fish first, then the potatoes with butter, and finally the veggies. </p>
<p>Just as we were finishing up dinner, two friends of Bryn's—Renaud and Tina—arrived at the door. They live in Paris, France, and are visiting the Bay area for a bit. Both men started talking business so Riku took over entertaining Tina, suggesting they find Waldo together. She was just great with him, really looking along with Riku, and they were very successful. Riku asked for a magnifying glass at one point, to make sure they really had found Waldo's girlfriend. I left them visiting, and had tea in the kitchen, working on another puzzle. A little while later, Riku suggested they go in the dining room and look at his latest Lego project and the two of them sat there finding pieces, which Riku put together. </p>
<p>They finished off their time together with Riku showing both Tina and Renaud his prowess on the computer. He calls it his "blog" although he also tells people that it isn't really his blog. He's very happy with company, old or new, and it shows. He's just comfortable with adults in a way that many children aren't. There isn't even a moment of being hesitant with them, feeling them out. He just assumes they are all good and interesting people and goes from there. I love his social skills! </p>
<p>And it is hilarious to hear all his new English expressions as he talks to them ... "It's not easy, you know; it's hard work!" Bryn has noticed how much his English has improved, although he is sounding very much like his Nana in his expressions. It really is funny to hear it all coming out of him ... "It's just adorable!" or "Isn't that the cutest thing you ever saw?" </p>
<p>No tub tonight, as they all went off for dinner together at 7:30, but Riku was asleep at 8:15, a tired but happy boy for sure. </p>
<p>Off I go ... hoping to get a few more emails written tonight. </p>

								<p>Riku was keen to get busy making our cake after his day away from home, so we put on our aprons and got to work! I took lots of photos of him, but here are just six, showing some of the stages of our baking: cracking eggs, sifting, mixing, pouring, tasting, and spreading. We always add coconut and pineapple to our carrot cake too, and Riku can hardly wait to taste it tomorrow. We couldn't ice it tonight as we are out of icing sugar. Just as well, as there was no time in our busy evening! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/double_dates.html">Double Playdates</a></h2>
								<p>Riku had double playdates today, and he enjoyed both so much. We were out the door at 9:45, waiting in the car, so that we could follow Susan, Amelia, and Finn to the Coyote Point Museum, just past the airport. The house was very cool, with the fog hanging low over the city, but not long after the children started running around outside, off came their jackets. </p>
<p>The museum is just a wonderful spot for children, and grown-ups too. We started in the "discovery lab", a huge hit with the children, as there were lots of hands-on exhibits that kept them all busy for the longest time. There is an aviary, where we were about three feet from a very brave blue heron. The docent showed the children where other birds were as well, not so out in the open as the heron. The wildlife habitat was a hit too, with indoor and outdoor habitats containing dozens of native creatures that can't be released into the wild for one reason or another. We saw rattlesnakes, a badger ... much larger than I expected it to be(!), frogs, a porcupine, and river otters. We didn't see the coyotes today, but shall on our next trip. Upstairs was a beautiful area, called the environmental hall, with peek-a-boo windows, a place to make clay creatures, lots of informational panels, interesting enough that Amelia and Riku kept calling to each other to show what they had discovered. </p>
<p>We could have stayed on longer, exploring, but the children were hungry and so off we went to find a shady picnic area. Susan had brought along a yummy sandwich for me, and chips for all of us. Riku had his first cucumber and cream cheese sandwich, and even though he didn't think he was going to like it, he ate every bite. I packed along lots of fruit too, and the minute the children finished, they found a fabulous tree to climb. Amelia was the first one up, and after watching for a few minutes Riku clambered after her. It was the first time I had seen him climb a tree, and on the way home he confirmed that by saying "I climbed my very first tree today!" Finn tried, too, and no doubt by next year he'll be sitting beside his sister. </p>
<p>The nearby playground was great, and we spent about an hour there, so the children had plenty of running-around time. We heard there has been a second, and much larger, playground built on the grounds, so the next time we will find that one. As we were heading for the picnic tables, Riku said he would like to go back as we didn't see it all, or spend as much time on some things, and I have promised that we will go with Caillie. We didn't get to the beach or the hiking trails either. As Susan and the children were in the store, Riku rushed me upstairs and pointed out a wooded area that he wants to see the next time too. It was fun to have a new spot to explore, and thanks to Susan we had a great time doing so. </p>
<p>This morning, before leaving, I confirmed that Riku could have a playdate with Sophie, one of the children from his preschool "Little Angels". He and Sophie haven't spent much time together but get along well. She and her parents stayed at Akane's and Bryn's for two days this summer, and so the children had one long afternoon together then too. So, Susan led the way to that part of town and I dropped Riku off at 1:45. He and Sophie rang the doorbell here at 5:15, so he had a nice long playtime with her, too. </p>
<p>I ran the tub immediately, and got Riku's dinner on the table while he relaxed and played in the bath. Since he seems to be awaking just before 6:30 each morning I have decided he can use an extra half hour sleep, so tonight he was asleep at 7:30. Shall see how this goes; with the busy days ahead with Caillie, though, it will likely work out just fine. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/water_a_play_date_scooters_and.html">Water,  , Scooters, Carrots, and ... Caillie Arrives!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku had a new swimming instructor today, and he had such a fun and successful lesson. He always enjoys it, but today he was really looking forward to his time in the water. She had him do so much swimming, albeit with his water wings on, but he was more confident than I had seen him, and kept telling her to move further back, and still further. He also put his head right under the water for the first time, and swam across the pool dipping his head down, and then up, over and over again. He was so excited when he finished and so was I! </p>
<p>We were on our own today, and drove right to Susan's for a playdate with the children. They played in the house for a bit, and then we headed out with Finn on his tricycle (with a long handle, pushed by Susan), Amelia on her bicycle, with <strong>no</strong> training wheels!. and Riku trying out a scooter for the first time. Once Susan told him it was easier if his pushing foot stayed close to the foot on the board, he actually got his feet both off the ground a few times. </p>
<p>We walked/rode over to a playground I haven't been to before. All the children did lots of running around and climbing, before we made our way down a winding path to a lovely little garden area with butterflies and lots of flowers. Riku sat on a hay bale at one point, being a storyteller, which was fun to hear. I wish I had thought to record it! </p>
<p>Susan treated to ice cream on the way home. Riku always says he is not "a big fan of ice cream" but he ate about half of his chocolate cookie crumb cone before handing it over to me. Before saying goodbye, we went into the tiny back yard at Susan's, and the children picked some tiny tiny carrots. Riku was over the moon with permission to take a dozen of them with us. </p>
<p> We were home about 4:30, and he immediately went into the bathroom, filled the sink with water, put out a clean facecloth beside the sink, and washed and nipped the ends off. He suggested we have them for dinner, which we did. </p>
<p>We were in time to hear from Doug that Caillie was an hour late leaving Toronto, due to the worst storm Kelly can ever remember! Later we learned that a tornado had touched down in a couple of places near Toronto, so we were lucky that Caillie was able to get out when she did. </p>
<p>Riku and I had the evening at home together, as Doug was at his class and Bryn was over with Kevin for dinner and bedtime, while Susan went out to a movie and dinner with friends, a rare event these days.</p>
<p>It wasn't a quiet evening, though, as Riku had me laughing so hard, and I had him laughing too. He was in just such a funny mood ... singing a Japanese song, but just one line, loudly and with a very <strong>deep</strong> voice, and then trying to teach it to me, funnier still! </p>
<p>Our dinner was a long leisurely one, thanks to all the fun we were having, and I got rave reviews about the breaded fish, the sweet potatoes, and of course his lightly steamed carrots, which he pronounced "delicious"! </p>
<p>We added another "room" to our house in heaven, one filled with dogs and cats, all friendly. I'm sure this topic won't continue for long, but he certainly is thinking about it a lot right now, and it's fun to see what new things he comes up with. He phoned Bryn to say goodnight to him, and was enthusiastic and described his day in such glowing terms: riding the scooter, doing so well at his swimming class, and of course anticipating Caillie's visit tomorrow. And Bryn got to hear about the fish he had enjoyed, and how he would like to have that on his birthday too one day.</p>
<p>I had hoped to have him asleep at 7:30, as I have a feeling he will be up bright and early tomorrow, and Riku really rushed through his nightly routine ... teeth, bathroom, pulling down his duvet, and arranging the pillows so that we were at least in bed at that time. He was telling me to "be quick, Nana; we can do it. I know we can!" and then was happily sitting in the middle of his bed just as the hand on the clock reached that six on the bottom! We finished up the poems in the new Shel Silverstein book, which also pleased him, and he was asleep at 7:55. </p>
<p>I was pretty tired, from the fresh air and exercise I guess, so sat and read for a bit, and then filled in the time before picking Caillie up by adding some photos to the family tree on Doug's side from a fellow who has added them to his site. </p>
<p>I went to the airport for Caillie, leaving at 10:20 for her 10:45 arrival time, but had to wait a half hour before she came from a different direction than usual with a United gal who brought her to me. That first sight of her was astounding as she is taller than I am now! Later Kelly told me to take a look at the size of her shoes ... size 10! Kelly is sure she is going to be taller than her before long. </p>
<p>She is just lovely and looked perky and cheerful with her big smile and warm hug. She chatted all the way home about the friendly woman she met on the plane, about being hungry in Chicago, during her hour and a half wait there, but being told she would get something to eat on her next flight, which of course she did not ... and lots of other details ... the movie she sort of watched, how many chapters she read in her book, etc.  </p>
<p>So, she got ready for bed, I made her toast with cheese, and off she went to sleep. </p>
<p>It was 1 P.M. when I turned out my light ... where the time went, I have no idea but I did read longer than usual, for some reason. Lovely to go to bed with two of my grandchildren here! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/a_long_long_day.html">The State Fair Exodus, and a Long Long Day ...</a></h2>
								<p>Today started out much too early! On the chance that Riku might awaken earlier than ideal, I decided to slip downstairs when I awoke at 5:20, and crawled in with him. He will often sleep longer with someone in with him, and I thought today would be a good day for that to happen. As I crept down the stairs I could see the light on in his room! He told me he had turned it on to see what time it was, because he wondered if it was time to see Caillie! So, we turned out the light, lay down, I stroked his back, yawned big yawns, breathed heavily, feigning sleep, but it was to no avail. He was so good about lying there quietly, but it was obvious he wasn't going to get back to sleep. I drifted off at one point, and woke to find him out of bed, "tidying up my books" he told me, and then proceeded to carefully make up the bed with me in it! </p>
<p>So, of course we got up, and he did his two drawings for school while eating his fruit bowl. We went upstairs and cuddled in my bed, watching a few Pingu episodes, I showered, and at 8:30 I woke Caillie up quietly. She stretched a big stretch, and then reached out to give Riku a big hug. He was thrilled to bits, of course, and I don't think he stopped smiling all morning!  </p>
<p>Bryn had stayed overnight at Kevin's and Susan's, and phoned to let me know that he, Kevin, and the children were coming over for breakfast, while Susan packed up for a two-day trip to Sacramento. She, Kevin, and the children, plus Bryn and Riku are heading east for the State Fair, which starts tomorrow. </p>
<p>It was one busy household for a couple of hours, with four children buzzing around, playing upstairs, downstairs, outside, and sitting at the table eating/drawing and chatting to each other, and the adults. Bryn and Doug went off to pick up a rental car, while Kevin sat building Lego with Finn. They had hoped to leave at 10 A.M., but it was almost 11:30 when we went out to wave goodbye to them. </p>
<p>Caillie and I sat down to read in the living room for a while, talking about what to do today. I didn't have much energy at all, and neither did she, so she decided that lunch at "Barney's", one of the restaurants on her list, would be perfect. Doug was off having lunch with a friend, so Caillie and I drove to Noe Valley and parked up a block from 24th on a steep hilly street. </p>
<p>Lunch was delicious, as always, although I am just not used to big meals anymore, so the tofu burger — the "plain" one at that, no barbecue sauce, or avocado — and half the order of fries filled me up so much that I had a fruit bowl for dinner. Caillie enjoyed hers as she always does, as well as a chocolate milkshake. </p>
<p>We were full, and tired, and it was <strong>hot</strong> as we climbed up the hill to the car. Caillie had me in stitches, making up excuses as to why we should keep stopping, pretending to admire the view behind us every few steps. I was so tired that I forgot my camera, a very unusual thing for me ... so no photos of the first thing on Caillie's to-do list. I would normally have taken a photo of her with her veggie burger and shake, and perhaps one of her standing outside the restaurant. </p>
<p>It was certainly an Ocean Beach day, and we were both tempted to head out that way, but we hadn't thought of it ahead of time, didn't have our books with us, and of course I didn't have my camera ... and it was hot too! We dragged ourselves home and up the stairs and there we stayed put, the entire afternoon and evening. </p>
<p>Caillie curled up in the corner chair in the living room, covered with a blanket, and I stretched out on the sofa, reading too, until I drifted off into a deep sleep for about a half hour. Caillie had discovered my crafts drawer, with some special papers and fun things I had been saving for her  and the children, so she was happy working away on that for a bit. </p>
<p>Caillie also spent some time examining an American penny, which she told me had a picture of a man reading ... a novel? a comic book? the paper? ... and he was drinking a cup of something ... a Coke!, coffee perhaps? Sitting on a log?, a dock? and on she went with all sorts of possibilities. One of the things she did when we first got home was borrow a magnifying glass and fill me in on what was really going on with Abraham Lincoln. He is sitting on a log, reading (but of course no idea what) and did indeed have a cup of something beside him, but no further clues were discovered. What a funny girl she is! </p>
<p>Eventually we roused ourselves enough to play cards, followed by dinner at home, more cards, and tea for two. </p>
<p>Bryn called and told us that Riku had slept for the first hour of the trip, until they stopped for lunch in Vacaville, and then called later to tell us they had just spent two hours in the hotel pool, and had lots of fun. I spoke briefly to Riku too, and he sounded happy to be there. How nice for him to get away with his daddy. They're sharing a hotel room, just the two of them, and I think they will both have a great time on this trip. </p>
<p>Caillie and I finished up our day with a final game of Aces, and then she headed for bed at 10:30. It's wonderful having Caillie here with me! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/a_quiet_saturday_1.html">A Quiet Saturday</a></h2>
								<p>Caillie only slept until 8:30 this morning, much to my surprise. Partly as a result, I'm sure, of her early rising and my too short night as well, we had another lazy day again, which seemed to suit us both. Caillie and I had a leisurely breakfast, played cards, took long showers, and played cards again, although she has beat me all but one game so far!  </p>
<p>Our big plan for the day was a movie with Doug after lunch at home; we all thoroughly enjoyed "Julie and Julia", munching away on our refillable container of popcorn ... one and a half of them for $6.50. Yum! I always feel it's a good deal, as I never want anything more to eat except for a fruit bowl for the rest of the day. </p>
<p>A quick trip to Costco was next, for another pineapple, and more fruit, but it was very crowded and it took much longer than we expected it to. It was close enough to dinner time that we drove to El Toro to pick up the veggie burrito that Caillie has on her list of things to eat. She loves to sit and watch a movie here at home while eating it, as she and Bryn did last year, so she and I watched "The Sound of Music". Caillie was fading fast, though and so we stopped just a little more than halfway through it, and shall finish up another night. It has been a long time since I watched it, and I thoroughly enjoyed Caillie singing along to all of the songs, and even acting out some of it. She had been to a drama camp this summer, and played the part of one of the nuns, so she had it all down pat. What a lovely voice this child has! I must record her. </p>
<p>We did lots of reading and card playing and chatting today, but tomorrow we hope to have more energy and do something on Caillie's list. It just wasn't a beach day at all, with heavy fog covering the city, so different from the heat and sun we had yesterday (!) and we were fine with just staying put. </p>
<p>I got a message from Bryn at the end of the day, letting us know that Riku was asleep ... at 10:30 P.M. I know the plan for the fair, which started today, was to head off in the morning, go back to the hotel for a nap and a swim, and then be at the fair in the evening too, so I imagine all went as planned. Can't wait to hear all about it! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/not_a_quiet_sunday.html">Not a Quiet Sunday!</a></h2>
								<p>I hadn't realized that Bryn and Riku were coming back from Sacramento so early today. We had made plans to have lunch at "Fresh Choice", a big California buffet that all the older grandchildren like, and of course it's on Caillie's list. </p>
<p>We were going to leave at 11:30, so I especially was having a very relaxed morning, still in my dressing gown when the doorbell rang, as only Riku rings it, and up he came, bursting with so many stories, and carrying a container with two goldfish swimming about. Bryn had to have the rental car back at 11 A.M., so off he dashed, with Doug following not too much later to pick him up. We did get to hear that Riku had won a fish and the kind vendor let Amelia have one too. Riku is going to keep them here, until he leaves for Japan, at which point Amelia will have them at home. Amelia's fish is "Sparkley" and Riku named his "Bill". </p>
<p>Bryn and Susan assumed that neither of the children would be able to toss the ball that would win them a goldfish, and someone Riku got it on his first throw, much to Bryn's chagrin. Live creatures are not on Bryn's list of desirable prizes. We have our fingers crossed that they live longer than the last ones Riku brought home from Chinatown; I think that was two days! </p>
<p>Riku had eaten breakfast with Bryn, Susan, Kevin, and the children before coming home, but he had some fruit, and we heard all about the hotel, and all the swimming they did, and how he won a tiny blue bear, and a larger stuffed turtle too. What an excited boy he was; he told me that he wants to go next year, but wants me to go too. I would love it, says Riku, and I'm sure he's right. Bryn really liked the hotel too, and Riku enjoyed it all: the fair, the hotel room with his Daddy, and the swimming they did. </p>
<p>Riku was happy to discover that Caillie had brought two copies of "Finding Waldo" with her from home, and the two of them sat together on the sofa searching him and his cohorts out. Caillie has always been great at spotting these tiny characters, and Riku is as well, so they were finding them faster than Doug, Bryn, or I can! </p>
<p>As soon as the men were back with the car, Caillie, Riku, and I drove up to our local "playground on the hill". I tried hard to convince Riku to go to Golden Gate Park, or a new playground, but he was adamant that we not drive too far, which makes sense, given that he spent two hours getting home. That playground was crowded with lots of much younger children than is usual during the week, and it was really too windy and too crowded for Riku to play badminton with Caillie, which is what he really wanted to do. After a bit of climbing first, he and Caillie sat instead in the sandbox, something he rarely does at playgrounds anymore. It really was just too crowded for them to move around very fast.</p>
<p>Because of that, I did talk him into going to the Jackson Square playground, just a few blocks away, in case some of the children from school were there. He agreed, and we lucked out, as Skylar was there. Riku was quite shy about going over to play with her, but eventually they connected, and did some running around with Caillie, and even sat under the play equipment talking for a little while. </p>
<p>There was a great spot there for badminton, and even though the wind was blowing, Riku played enough that he was happy to put it aside and start running again. After Skylar left, another six-year-old girl asked Caillie to help her on one of the sliders, and soon all three of the children were dashing madly about. </p>
<p>Caillie was just wonderful, chasing them, and playing catch for well over an hour — how they loved it! They stopped for lots of drinks of water, used me for "base" to take a breath, and went right back to it. It was just the best thing in the world for Riku and Caillie, as they both got all that fresh air and exercise, and worked up a great appetite! </p>
<p>He went right into the tub when he got home, and I made big bowls of "chicken" noodle and veggie soup for dinner. There was just enough time for them to do some drawing together before they ate, while I iced the carrot cake for dessert;  it was a hit, so full tummies all 'round. </p>
<p>Caillie read Riku his bedtime story tonight, while I cleared up the kitchen. I snuck in to take a peek... sooo sweeet! I got in my final snuggle of the day, and he was quickly asleep at 7:30 tonight, and Caillie and I had tea, played cards (yes, she won again!), and she read while I got in some computer time. Caillie was in bed reading at 9:30 though, with lights out at 10 P.M. I was up to bed early too, for a nice change.</p>
<p>P.S. Beth emailed news with photos of her new grandson, EJ and Mel's beautiful big baby boy, Tristin Matthew, born at 2:01 this afternoon in Ontario, weighing in at a hefty 9 pounds, 7 ounces! So, I have another great-nephew in the world tonight. Happy news! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/funeral_beaches_magicians.html">A Funeral, Two Beaches, and Two Magicians</a></h2>
								<p>'twas a lovely day today, even though it started off on a sad note. Sparkley and Bill, the two goldfish from Sacramento, passed on to the great ocean in the sky during the night. One wasn't looking good at all when we went to bed last night, so I had changed the water and separated them into two different bowls, but it didn't help. We had a little funeral service, à la "The Tenth Good Thing about Barney" (a Judith Viorst book my children loved as children). Caillie, Riku, and I all thought of something kind or good to say about the fish, and then gently slipped them, one at a time, into the toilet. We had a second ceremony for the second one, trying to come up with different things to say as we let this one go on his/her way. </p>
<p>The rest of the day was much happier, as Caillie, Riku, and I had a picnic lunch at a rocky little beach, somewhat sheltered from the wind, tucked in front of a big rock. We were at a beach not too far from Riku's swimming lesson and perhaps we will go again on Wednesday, after his final swimming lesson. As the wind picked up, a local told us that just five or six minutes down the highway was a large sandy beach; the sun was likely out there, as the fog was lifting, and it's usually warmer. </p>
<p>So we gathered up our blankets and picnic boxes, and drove off to a beach further south. We had good directions, as there was a Taco Bell at the front of the huge parking lot. Another fellow told us the locals call it Taco Bell beach, and that stuck well enough that now I can't remember the actual name for it. It was still windy, but we agreed for Riku's sake that we would stay for fifteen minutes, and ended up enjoying it for more than an hour and a half. </p>
<p>Caillie and Riku drew their names in the sand, and we sat and watched the high waves and the surfers. As always, Riku was as happy as a clam sitting and lying in the sand, digging holes, and filling them in again. We all had such a great time, as there was lots to see, including a large flock of pelicans that seemed happy to be at this particular beach too. </p>
<p>On the way back to the car we stopped in for a snack, a cheese and bean burrito for Riku, and a seven layer burrito for Caillie. I had ordered one earlier, as I hadn't packed myself a sandwich, not intending to be out long enough to be hungry after my big breakfast. </p>
<p>Riku got into a warm tub as soon as we got home, Doug went off to the library, and Caillie learned some new card tricks on the computer. She has been showing me some wonderful card tricks, one that she learned when she was just four years old, and now with a renewed interest in learning more, I am seeing lots more. </p>
<p>I read Riku a book Doug picked up this afternoon, called "Monster Goose", a parody of the "Mother Goose" verses, and even though Riku initially did not like the illustrations, by the end of the book he quite enjoyed the way they were done. He was asleep at 7:55, and Caillie was ready to show Doug her card tricks once he had eaten. He gave her a few tips, and showed her a couple more, promising to teach her the best one before she leaves. </p>
<p>Card time followed, but both Hans and Kelly called to chat in between, so I did a little tidying up and was ready when she finished up. She showed me one last trick (she's good at them too!), and went off to read, while I went through photos for the blog, and wrote up the last one. Bedtime late for me again, but with lots done too! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/panyo_fresh_choice_and_linda_m.html">"Ponyo", "Fresh Choice", and Linda Mar</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke at 5:50 this morning, and decided to sneak downstairs and crawl into bed with Riku. Often when he has someone in with him, he will sleep longer, but it seems now his body is used to waking at 6:30, as even though I was dozing quietly beside him, he wakened at his usual time. That was just fine, though, as Doug had picked up five Judith Viorst books from the library last night, and we snuggled in bed reading all of them. It was lovely, as we haven't done this many books in the morning for a long time. He liked each and every one of them, and even though he thought he wasn't going to like "The Tenth Good Thing about Barney" (the few and small illustrations were all in black and white), he ended up loving the story, as I knew he would. It had all of his favourite elements in it: a great story, some sad parts, some happy parts, perfect illustrations (once he knew the story), and lots to talk about afterward too. </p>
<p>Bryn sat at the table with Riku for breakfast, and the two of them did some drawing together. Riku has been very good about drawing his two pictures for school each morning before getting on with his day. Caillie is pleased to sit and draw alongside Riku as well, which makes him very happy.</p>
<p>Caillie slept later today than she has since arriving, and came stumbling out of her room at 10 o'clock. I should have wakened her, as we had an early start today, but she was a trouper and even managed to get a shower and eat a quick breakfast before we left the house at 10:40! </p>
<p>We've all been looking forward to seeing this new Japanese film, called Ponyo, and had decided to combine it with lunch out as well. Panyo was delightful, and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. Riku sat on the edge of his chair for about 80% of the movie, and Doug was either nudging me, or me him, as we watched Riku's face lit up while he watched it. He and Caillie both loved the underwater scenes, and the characters, especially Ponyo, were just perfect. </p>
<p>Ten minutes after the movie ended, we were lined up with trays at the ready, for lunch at Fresh Choice, on Caillie's list. She enjoyed it as much as always, and ate three of her favourite corn muffins (they're mine too, and I believe Kelly's as well), as well as lots of good fresh food. Riku chose an assortment of vegetables for his plate, ate every bite of it, and liked a chocolate brownie muffin, much to my surprise. Caillie and Doug both love the soft serve ice cream with caramel sauce, and Riku found cherry jello, topping it off with toasted coconut sprinkles. I always eat such a huge assorted salad plus a baked potato with all the fixings, and so never want dinner that evening. </p>
<p>Caillie, Riku, and I were taking our time finishing up, and taking lots of photos of each other too. Caillie took a few of Riku and me, a rare event, and one or two turned out quite well. Riku really hammed it up for some of them, which kept us all laughing. </p>
<p>We were not all that far from the beach ("Linda Mar") that we went to yesterday, so drove a little further down the coast, and spent an hour there. It was a little windier than yesterday, though, so Caillie bundled herself up in two blankets, protecting herself from the wind, while Riku did his usual scouring of the beach, looking for anything of interest. He's quite happy to wander off on his own, or settle down a little further along from the rest of us, having some quiet time, lying in the sand, and poking about with a stick. I joined him after a while and we went looking together. He found two heart-shaped rocks, and I brought the little one home for myself, at his request; Doug built a little stone structure, which I liked a lot. </p>
<p>Usual evening ... Doug went off to his class, Riku had a long tub time, and he and Caillie started watching "Chicken Run", which arrived from Netflix in the mail today. I made vegetable fried rice for dinner tonight, and allowed them to eat it in front of the TV for a special treat. </p>
<p>After the video was half over, I brought them down to do some drawing at the table, and Bryn showed up just at that point, spending the evening at home. Before bedtime, Riku and Caillie sat at the computer so that she could show him more of the options he has with the drawing program he is so fond of right now. It was fun to see the two of them doing this, as she is patient and he learns quickly. </p>
<p>Caillie was thrilled that Bryn was home tonight,  as she was hoping we would have a chance to play "Spades" with him, which we did. I selected some photos for my blog entry, but was too tired to do anything more than that. I went up to bed at 10:30, but wish I had had the energy to answer a few emails.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/badm_day.html">BADM Day with Auntie Susan and Finn</a></h2>
								<p>Riku decided he would like one more day at the Bay Area Discovery Museum, so today was the day. Susan emailed in the early morning, wondering if we might be interested in going, as she was taking Finn. Riku and Caillie both were delighted to hear that we would meet up with them there. </p>
<p>Before leaving, though, Riku and I watched the last part of "Chicken Run". Riku got lots of laughs out of the happy ending and how it came about, and I enjoyed watching it with him. He and Caillie drew at the table while I packed up a big lunch with snacks, as we would be off to swimming not long after we got home. </p>
<p>Riku's left leg was bothering him, especially when sitting in the car. He asked if it was growing pains, as he can't remember hurting it, and I told him it could be, as his Daddy used to get them in his legs too when he was that age. He was limping on it for part of the time, and so we started our day at the painting and activity room painting with Finn. </p>
<p>It loosened up enough that he ended up having lots of fun at the playground too. Finn did whatever activity Riku suggested — on the boat, into the cave, digging in the gravel pit, climbing the hill to ring the bell — but they spent a huge amount of time in the twig house, playing hide and seek. Auntie Susan joined Caillie in the finding too, and I got to take lots of fun photos of the four of them running and hiding. Finn ran and laughed and hid along with them all, squealing when he got found. </p>
<p>We had stopped for lunch at 11:30, and since it was fairly windy and the fog hadn't quite lifted, Riku found a table for us inside the small lunch room. Everyone ate well (we were all hungry),  and Susan and I enjoyed our hot drinks along with our lunches. </p>
<p>Finn and Susan left first, for Finn's nap, and then we left reluctantly at 1:30, with a promise to stop in at the gift shop. Caillie bought a tiny box of tiny shells for a friend, and I bought Riku a box of the same shells, and five golden coins for his treasure box at home. </p>
<p>Riku had a swimming lesson at 3 o'clock today, and so there was time for just a little snack and a bit of time at home before leaving for Pacifica. Unfortunately, the instructor Riku had liked so much, and had done so well with last week, called in sick and Riku had a new teacher. He was spending a lot of time in the corner with her, which surprised us, as he had been swimming across the pool last week with his face underwater for much of it. This gal had him sitting a little too far back on the side of the pool at one point, and we could see that he didn't want her pulling him into the water.</p>
<p> It was the first lesson when he wasn't grinning and laughing and enjoying it all, and about fifteen minutes into the lesson, he was crying! Of course it was very upsetting for all of us, and I asked at the desk if I should take him out. I was told that it would be best to let him finish the lesson, but it sure was tough to sit there! The last eight minutes or so, he was still looking sad, but enjoyed the last few minutes of throwing the ball back and forth to his teacher. When I went to him with his towel once he was finished the lesson, though, he burst into tears again. </p>
<p>We talked while I toweled him off and dressed him, and by the time we got to the car he was feeling better. The biggest issue for him was that the teacher told him she wouldn't let go of him in the water, and she did. He just didn't trust her after that, and it all went downhill from there. </p>
<p>Krispy Kreme doughnuts are on Caillie's to-do list, and this was Riku's last day to get them, so off we went for that special treat. Riku stayed in the car with me for the first time, and Caillie and Doug went in for two big doughnuts for each of them, and Riku's two favourite glazed tiny ones. </p>
<p>There had been some discussion in the morning about Riku spending some time over these last three days with three friends from school. We set up something via phone messages for today, after the class, and I wasn't sad when it didn't work out, as Riku needed some time with Caillie at home. They watched part of the chipmunk movie Riku had asked for from Netflix, we had a nice dinner together downstairs, and both did a drawing as well. Caillie drew a fantastical fish with lots of colours.  </p>
<p>I told Riku I wanted him to have just a five-minute tub to get the chlorine off his skin. He agreed, but then called me into the bathroom and asked me to watch him put his face under the water. I counted as he held his breath to the count of 21(!), and then 27. He was so very pleased with himself, as well he should be, and I called Doug in to see this too. This final time he went to the count of 31! We were so pleased and so proud of him, as he obviously did not lose his faith in himself despite the bad lesson. He was spluttering, and didn't use the "safe cloth" to wipe his eyes, but just blinked a lot and tossed the hair back from his forehead.Doug explained to him that he could exhale while still under water, and I taped him, as he wanted to know if we could see the bubbles he thus made. <br />
. <br />
While Riku was bathing, Caillie went into her room with my camera set to video, to record a song she had written today. I listened through the closed door for a few minutes, and was once again astounded at her amazing voice! I'm hoping she finishes her song off before she leaves, so we can capture one full version. She was having trouble remembering the tune, and of course I was of no help to her at all. </p>
<p>Riku wanted Caillie to sit with him in bed, going through a catalogue of Hallowe'en costumes, and then I went in and read "Just in Case" to him again. </p>
<p>Bryn came in just as we were finishing up dinner, and after he and Doug came back from a Rainbow run (while I was tucking Riku in), Bryn had a game of Spades with us. </p>
<p>He went out for the evening, so Caillie and I had our usual game of Aces, which she won once again! She went off to bed at 10 to read, and I spent a half hour on the computer, before heading up to bed. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/a_full_fun_day.html">A Full Fun Day!</a></h2>
								<p>I had just enough time to read a story to Riku in bed this morning, while he ate his fruit, before he and Bryn left at 7:20 for breakfast at Jim's Restaurant with Mari. Riku loves hash browns and has been eating them since he was a little guy at this "greasy spoon" on Mission Street. Mari came back to the house for a minute for final goodbyes, and then she and Bryn headed off to walk to the bus stop. </p>
<p>Today is the day we had set aside for a long leisurely visit to the Coyote Point Museum. Riku had enjoyed it all so much last week, when we were there with Susan and the children, and we decided Caillie and Doug would like it too. I packed up a big picnic lunch and we were off. There really is so much to do and see there, and we all had a great time. Caillie and Riku did all the hands-on fun parts first, with the vortex and flying foam parts and more, and then strolled around the large area upstairs with so many interesting displays. Riku and Caillie lingered over these, calling to each other to come to see what they had found. </p>
<p>The animal section was next and Riku couldn't wait to show Doug and Caillie the huge yellow banana slug he discovered last week. We did manage to spot the coyote this time, although he was sleeping, much to Riku's disappointment. There was lots to see, though ... otters at feeding time, snakes, frogs, butterflies, birds, sleeping porcupines and badgers. </p>
<p>Right at noon, Riku announced he was hungry and wanted to eat right then! So we went back to the same picnic area as last time, mostly so that Riku and Caillie could climb the same tree he climbed last week. Everyone was hungry and we enjoyed our lunches first, and then Riku and Caillie did some climbing. There was still more to see inside the museum, though, so back we went, and Riku spotted the coyote, wide awake and standing up looking right out at us! We were all very excited, and managed to get some good photos of him. </p>
<p>We had heard there was a big new playground on the grounds, so we drove toward the entry gate, and discovered "Magic Kingdom", a lovely top-notch playground with a huge enclosed twisty slide, built into a massive play structure. There were also swings, and regular slides, and <br />
"creatures" to climb on and in. It was too hot for Doug and me, but Caillie and Riku had a great time and Riku particularly did not want to leave.</p>
<p>There was a beach nearby and that appealed to me, so we walked toward the water, through a huge flock of Canada Geese (Riku now knows how big and green their BMs are!), but realized we couldn't get to the beach without walking too far in the heat. Riku begged for more time at the playground, Doug and I found a shady tree just outside the play area, and eventually it was time to leave for home, and a playdate with Ian for Riku. </p>
<p>Caillie finished her book yesterday, so she and Doug went to the library on 24th Street, coming home with two new books for her to read. I'm sure she won't get through both of them, but it doesn't hurt to have a spare. Later in the evening she read bits of one to Kelly, and it sounded like a perfect book for her. </p>
<p>Ian's parents picked Riku up at 4:20 and dropped him back home, after more playground time at a local spot. They had a great time together, and Bryn arrived home just in time to have a chat with Wendy, Ian's mom, before saying goodbye. </p>
<p>I popped Riku right into the tub, and finished off making a dinner I knew Riku and Caillie would enjoy ... fresh corn chowder, with two pieces of Riku's favourite fish fillets, and sides of veggies for them both. I also made a lemon pudding cake, an old favourite from when Kelly and Bryn were little. Caillie liked it very much, but Riku not so much. Instead he had a bowl of fresh pineapple, and we saved a dish of the pudding for Bryn, who liked it very much. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep at 7:45 tonight, leaving Caillie and me time for two games of cards, before she went off with her new book to read while I got in some time on the computer.  </p>
<p>Hot hot night here! We have the fan going in our bedroom for the first time this month. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/xxx_finally_a_gorgeous_ocean_b.html">Finally, a Gorgeous Ocean Beach Day, and a Reunion for Riku</a></h2>
								<p>Even though we have been to Linda Mar beach twice, and Riku and I had made an attempt for a picnic at Ocean Beach a couple of weeks ago, we just have not had that perfect day there we all love so much. After our very hot day yesterday, and night too(!) — very unusual here, I had a feeling today was the day. And it was! Caillie and Riku watched a bit of Cinderella this morning, while eating part of their breakfast in front of the TV, and I packed up our lunches and snacks for our day. </p>
<p>Amelia was home from school, not feeling well, so we made arrangements to meet there. Traffic was slow, I had to stop for gas, there was construction after that to wind through, but finally there we were! It was just the perfect day, with lots of sun, cooler air at the water, and no wind, always the big hurdle with this beach. Caillie lay on the blanket on her own, while Susan, Finn, Riku, Amelia, and I wandered down the beach. Amelia had a nice big bucket full of shells already, and she helped Riku add to his bucket. Finn meandered along as well, enjoying himself, and we headed back to the central part of the beach after Susan stepped on a bee, and got badly stung. </p>
<p>We had our lunch, after which Caillie joined the children down at the water's edge. Susan had brought along a couple of water guns, so they were in use, although when they are filled from the edge of the water, they are also filled with sand. Caillie got really soaked, but was a very good sport about it, even if she was the favourite target. I took lots of photos, of course, as beach photos with the children are among my favourites. </p>
<p>Susan, Amelia, and Finn went back to the far end of the beach for a walk and exploration, giving Caillie and Riku some time alone in the water ... and for more photos of the two of them. We're down to our last day with Riku. </p>
<p>We got home just in time to have a quick drink, splash our faces, and go off to Starr King, (Riku's school here until this past March), to meet up with teachers and former classmates. Caillie stayed home on her own to shower off the salt water. </p>
<p>Doug dropped Riku and me off at the school, and he had such a lovely reunion. We first went to see his grade one teacher, Ms. Tong, and happily gave her as big a hug as he got from her, along with her lovely big smile.</p>
<p>Leaving her to getting her class ready for dismissal, we walked down the hall and spotted some of the children from his class last year, now in grade two. The teacher didn't know Riku, but had been told by the principal that we would be stopping in. His old classmates gathered 'round him, giving him hugs, holding his hands, and asking him lots of questions.</p>
<p>As we were walking down the opposite end of the hall, on our way outside, I noticed some other classmates, with a new teacher as well, and even though Riku was a little shy about going back to stand in the door of that room, he did, and got another chorus of "Hi Riku!". I am sorry I didn't get photos of these children too, but the teacher didn't seem quite so user-friendly. </p>
<p>Some parents of these former classmates spotted us as we walked downstairs to the courtyard, and stopped to say hello to Riku too, patting him on the head, and asking a few questions. Riku is quite shy about these situations until they are underway, and then he is just fine with it all and happy.</p>
<p>Outside we spotted Ms. To, his kindergarten teacher coming out with her class, and Riku went running up to her with no hesitation at all. She was obviously just as pleased to see him and enveloped him in a huge hug, and a big smile.</p>
<p>Once the children had been collected by their parents, Ms. Chang, his English teacher in kindergarten, came running up to embrace him in a, yes, big hug!  At one point all three teachers were there, asking him lots of questions, patting him, hugging him again, and all of them told him how much they missed him, and how tall he was! It was adorable, and it was just great that he was here in the city just as school was back in session, to see these familiar faces.</p>
<p>Riku and I walked home down our familiar route. He stopped to give "his" little round tree a hug, and to comment that it needed some water. Then we walked down the 132 steps we had walked down so many times before, holding hands and counting as we we did so. It was so hot, and it seemed a perfect time for Caillie and him to finish watching their movie, with the fan blowing on them, while I got dinner ready. </p>
<p>About three weeks ago, Riku had asked if we could have "that dinner where you put the bread in the hot cheese on a stick" ... cheese fondue! I had no memory of Riku enjoying it so much; we always have it on Christmas Day, so he had tucked that away in his mind until now. So, we decided we would have it the last night of his stay here, with Caillie. Bryn was joining us as well, so it was perfect. Caillie said she wasn't crazy about it, but would try again (Kelly and Gregg now serve it on Christmas Eve or up in the Manitoulin sometime during their stay there). She liked it and had it for dinner, instead of something else, so I was very pleased about this. It really is a family traditional meal for us. </p>
<p>The evening was our usual one, with Riku tubbed first, then time with Caillie, on the computer tonight with the drawing program, and then two books before tuck-in at 8 P.M.. Doug and Bryn had gone off to a movie, Caillie and I had two games of cards with our tea, and then had some quiet time on our own for the last bit of the evening. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/sayonara_to_bryn_and_riku.html">Sayonara to Bryn and Riku, and a Touristy Day for Caillie and Me</a></h2>
								<p>Riku called out during the night, and even though I was sure he would fall back to sleep on his own, I decided to have a few hours with him, and perhaps have him sleep in a little later this morning as well. It worked, as he awoke at 7:10, and was very happy to find me there, waiting to read to him. He ate his fruit bowl while we snuggled and read, for the last time in too long. </p>
<p>We had heard about a "science" experiment for children, using Mountain Dew soda, baking soda, and peroxide, and decided today was the day to try it out. It was supposed to turn a fluorescent green in the dark when mixed together, but to our disappointment, nothing at all happened. It turned out to be a hoax, as Doug learned, but the failed experiment made Riku decide to try some others. So, out came the vinegar, the baking soda, some cinnamon, a little oil, and a few other last minute ideas... green fluid made from mixing one of his marking pens in water, and a funnel. This kept Riku busy for the longest time, and it was lots of fun to watch him being so serious about it all. </p>
<p>Packing was well underway not long after Bryn woke, as I had most of Riku's belongings on the sofa, and some of Bryn's too. He got busy filling their two suitcases, and had most of it done when an old friend from Vancouver, Mark Henderson, stopped by with his girlfriend Meridith, to have breakfast with Bryn. They arrived in town just last night, so it was to be a very quick visit, unfortunately. </p>
<p>Caillie slept in quite late too, but was up and showered by the time that they all arrived back at the house. Meridith was very sweet with Riku, sitting on the floor going through his tin box of insects and snakes, and talking to him about them all ... which were their favourites, which would make a better pet, etc. It was great to see Mark again and to meet Meridith. Riku showed them his art work, stored on Doug's computer, and the time went by quickly. They left after we took what has become our traditional "photo with guests", and Riku gets right into his usual position on the top of the sofa. </p>
<p>Riku and Caillie had time to watch two short episodes of "Casper", and Riku had the third part of his breakfast upstairs. I packed up his snacks and a sandwich for the plane, Bryn lightened Riku's very heavy backpack to make room for them, and to make that pack lighter too! </p>
<p>I was feeling very sad as I realized that, with every thing we did, it was going to be the last time, for a long time. Riku told me not to get rid of any more toys as he will be back, and I got lots of impulsive extra hugs and kisses too. In the night, when he was lying there, he said very quietly, "I don't want to go home." I don't think he was saying it to me, but this morning he was very excited at the prospect of seeing Mirei and his mommy. That made me feel much better! He said Mirei would be very glad to have him home again, as she really likes the cat game he plays with her; he is the cat, and Mirei is his "mommy". </p>
<p>So, of course the time came too quickly to leave the house. Caillie and I sat with him in the back seat. Riku pointed out the hill that he didn't climb with his daddy this trip; it was on his list, and so I promised it would be on the list for next summer. We chatted all the way to the airport, just a ten minute drive, so not long at all, and said our goodbyes at the curb. He's very excited about this trip alone with his Dad, watching movies, and being on their way home. </p>
<p>It was a hot day again, so I was ready to just sit and put my feet up when we got home. Caillie worked on the last of three letters to a friend, and we went off to mail that for today's pickup. Not much later, we had decided to do Ghiradelli Square, for a hot fudge sundae, as well as walk to Pier 39 to see the sea lions. </p>
<p>First came the hot fudge sundae! We shared it, though Caillie could have eaten a whole one on her own, so I put down my spoon and let her finish it off. The whole area was just packed and we were dodging folks all the way to Pier 39. </p>
<p>There were more sea lions today than I have ever seen before, and the stench was pretty awful. We didn't linger, but wandered about window shopping; Caillie went into a couple of stores, and we enjoyed the much cooler air in this part of the city. </p>
<p>Caillie was pretty tuckered out from a too late bedtime last night, and was happy to head home after the long walk back to the Square. </p>
<p>A plain cheese pizza from Amici's was on Caillie's list too, and so Doug and I placed our order, and went to pick it up, while Caillie had some computer time on her own here. The pizza was delicious, and she and I had two games of cards after we finished, as well as our tea. Caillie is drinking herbal tea, which is great, as I seldom use it and she is enjoying it so much. </p>
<p>Bed early for Caillie tonight; she read until 9:30, I wrote just a few emails ... I'm so far behind now, I can't begin to catch up, and chose my blog photos too. </p>
<p>I'm tired, emotionally and physically, and am going off to bed to read my wonderful hard-to-put-down book "Too Many Men"; it's not a light and easy book, but a page turner for certain, and I am reading much later than I should be these nights! </p>
<p>I hope Riku is sleeping soundly on the plane, along with his Dad. They've been flying now for nine hours and must be getting close to Korea, where they will wait for their connection to Osaka. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/another_day_being_tourists.html">Another Day Being Tourists</a></h2>
								<p>The plan for today, after our two gorgeous days of hot, clear weather, was to walk the Golden Gate Bridge with Caillie, something we do each time she is here. It's on her list!  :) However, living on the west coast means that the weather changes constantly and quickly and so we woke to low-hanging fog today, and it was still hanging about at noon. </p>
<p>So we had a lazy morning at home, all of us happy not to be dashing out immediately. Caillie has been busy with my craft drawer since she arrived, making colourful cards, writing letters to a friend, and to Gregg's mom, but also just poking about with all the paper, stickers, and soft wires, and lots of glue and tape too! She sat at the table as busy as could be, while I got at the laundry, got a couple of emails out, and cleared things away. </p>
<p>When it was clear that we weren't going to walk the bridge, which is not fun at all when it's covered with fog (cold and with no view), we changed plans, and decided to go to see Andy Goldsworthy's "The Spire", and decide from there what to do next. Caillie saw "Fault Line" last year so she has two of Goldsworthy's pieces under her belt now. She keeps a tiny journal she started when she was just three years old, on her trip to visit us in England, and has kept it up each trip with us since. </p>
<p>Doug suggested we go to the Pet Cemetery in the Presidio.. At first Caillie wasn't sure about this, but she enjoyed it very much. It's very touching as there are sweet dedications to beloved pets, just tiny and not elaborate, but heart-felt for sure, to the pets of soldiers and officers at the base, dating mostly from WW1 and WWII. The site is in pretty sad condition; the Boy Scouts used to take care of it, but haven't for a few years, and now just recently many trees have been cut down to make room for bridge repairs, and it all looks quite neglected. We wandered about reading out the inscriptions on the markers to each other, and looking at the photos of some of the pets. </p>
<p>From there we went to the Palace of Fine Arts, as Caillie had not been there before. It's a lovely spot, with lots of photo opportunities, so we spent perhaps a half hour there just wandering about. I hope to do this with Kelly, Gregg, and the four children when they come in March. </p>
<p>Chinatown is also on Caillie's to-do list, and so we had Doug drop us off a block from the "dragon gate" that officially marks this area. We had such a good time, laughing our way up one side of the street and down the other, warning each other not to look at the hanging barbecued ducks in the windows. Ugh! Our plan had been to have lunch in Chinatown, and we checked out a few menus, but nothing really appealed to us. It might have had something to do with those dead ducks. We went in and out of a few stores, as Caillie thought she might find something fun to take home as a souvenir, but nothing clicked, and we were ready for lunch. </p>
<p>Caillie had a yen for sushi, and if we had had more time, we would have taken a bus to Japantown, but instead walked to the big shopping centre at the cable car turnaround point on Market Street. There was only one very expensive sushi restaurant there, so we walked over to Macy's, checked out their food area, and hit the jackpot! Caillie ordered two plates, one a California roll and one cucumber. There were twelve pieces in all and she enjoyed every bite of  it. I had my favourite Boudin sourdough roll filled with tuna salad; it has been many months since I've had one, and it was delicious. </p>
<p>We lucked out by catching a bus within three minutes of standing at the bus stop at Union Square, transferred to the #19 bus to Potrero Hill within five minutes, and got home about 6 P.M. I was tired and ready for a hot cup of tea, but also had lots to do, and managed to do both. Caillie is trying hard to finish up a library book, and she spent some time on the computer too. Our evenings fly by quickly! </p>
<p>An hour and a half later, Doug and I drove to El Toro to pick up a burrito for Caillie's dinner. We made another stop at Taqueria Can-Cún on Mission Street to pick one up for Doug (he is no longer an El Toro fan), and I had some fruit for dinner, still full from my late lunch. Caillie and I went upstairs to watch a movie she had Doug rent for us from Netflix, an oldie called "Bringing up Baby", with Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant. It was just delightful; I think she had seen it a few years ago with either her dad or mom, and thought I would enjoy it too. I did, although we stopped it at 9 o'clock so that Caillie could get to bed, read, and have her light out by 9:30. </p>
<p>I am just starting to panic at all that needs doing before leaving for Toronto on Wednesday. We're off to Santa Cruz tomorrow, and that gives me one day to organize the packing, trying not to forget all the extras I want to take with me, getting through as many emails as I can, as I may not have a computer for a month, and a dozen other little jobs that must be done before we leave. Bed too late at midnight, and I read too long after that too! Who <strong>do</strong> I see about getting more hours in my day?</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/08/xxx_santa_cruz.html">Santa Cruz!</a></h2>
								<p>We were hoping to do Santa Cruz with both Caillie and Riku, but the timing just didn't work out (Riku had swimming lessons booked, and friends to see), so yesterday we set off with Caillie for one of the last items on her to-do list.</p>
<p>Doug and I had two errands to do first. Doug had an appointment at 9 A.M. and, as a result, is now signed up for Medicare, which means he will have health insurance coverage here as of October! Yahoo! I went to get a much needed hair cut but learned that my gal doesn't start work on Mondays until noon, so that has to wait until tomorrow, my last day at home for a month. </p>
<p>The day was perfect for our trip south, not too hot, and not too cool, but just right! We stopped, as has now become our tradition, in Capitola, a tiny town just outside Santa Cruz, for lunch at "Dharma's", a vegetarian restaurant. Caillie knew without looking at the menu that she would be having her favourite burrito there, I had a wonderful white bean and basil soup, a huge and delicious side salad, and a serving of brown rice. It was all delicious. Doug had a breakfast burrito, one of his favourite dishes at this spot. </p>
<p>We spent a lovely couple of hours there, first walking out to the end of the wharf to check out the view and the sea lions. There were a few in the usual spot under the wharf, but today we saw lots of them along the south side of the wharf as well. And, much to our delight, found some very laid back sea lions basking and rocking gently in someone's catamaran! </p>
<p>Caillie was only interested in doing the big roller coaster ride, as she and her family will be here during March break next year. She decided she would rather go on the other rides with them, and so she and her grandfather went on two roller coaster rides together. They were both disappointed in the first one, but had a great time, as always, on the one that gives them a long classic high ride, rather than the quick bends and shorter dips on the first ride. I prefer neither! </p>
<p>We bought some salt water taffy too, as that was the second thing Caillie wanted in Santa Cruz. It's now available at Pier 39, but she waited until she could get it where she always has. I noticed the open bag beside her bed while she was reading tonight. </p>
<p>After arriving home, we had a quick dinner made up of things in the fridge that won't keep, and then Caillie and I went upstairs to eat while watching the end of "Bringing up Baby". It ended happily, of course, with the protaganists in love. I have suggested to Doug that he watch it on his own before sending it back to Netflix. Such fun to see Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant oh-so-many years ago. </p>
<p>I had to do a Creative Memories order to buy extra sheets for my albums ... the company is changing the size of their albums(!), and so Caillie, with pen and paper in hand, went with me from spot to spot, helping me count how many pages and protectors I need for them all. It was a biggish job and went much faster with my secretary close by. </p>
<p>Bryn wrote to let me know that Riku had awakened happily at 7:30 this morning, despite awaking a few times during the night. He walked to school on his own, and when Bryn showed up a little later on, after biking there with extra school supplies for Riku, he was happily engaged in conversation with his classmates. Mirei starts back at her French Immersion program tomorrow, although is protesting, saying she would rather go to the Japanese preschool program she attended for a session this summer. </p>
<p>She and Riku are happy to be back in each other's company, and she is making them all laugh with a new trick ... turning her tongue upside down and then sticking it out! What a girl! In just one month and three days I will have her with me for a couple of weeks. </p>
<p>The evening passed too quickly as always, and I went off to bed at 11 P.M. tonight. All the fresh air and walking today made me too tired to stay up too late. Just as well ... tomorrow will be a very busy day, packing up for a month away. </p>
