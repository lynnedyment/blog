								<h2>The State Fair Exodus, and a Long Long Day ...</h2>
								<p>Today started out much too early! On the chance that Riku might awaken earlier than ideal, I decided to slip downstairs when I awoke at 5:20, and crawled in with him. He will often sleep longer with someone in with him, and I thought today would be a good day for that to happen. As I crept down the stairs I could see the light on in his room! He told me he had turned it on to see what time it was, because he wondered if it was time to see Caillie! So, we turned out the light, lay down, I stroked his back, yawned big yawns, breathed heavily, feigning sleep, but it was to no avail. He was so good about lying there quietly, but it was obvious he wasn't going to get back to sleep. I drifted off at one point, and woke to find him out of bed, "tidying up my books" he told me, and then proceeded to carefully make up the bed with me in it! </p>
<p>So, of course we got up, and he did his two drawings for school while eating his fruit bowl. We went upstairs and cuddled in my bed, watching a few Pingu episodes, I showered, and at 8:30 I woke Caillie up quietly. She stretched a big stretch, and then reached out to give Riku a big hug. He was thrilled to bits, of course, and I don't think he stopped smiling all morning!  </p>
<p>Bryn had stayed overnight at Kevin's and Susan's, and phoned to let me know that he, Kevin, and the children were coming over for breakfast, while Susan packed up for a two-day trip to Sacramento. She, Kevin, and the children, plus Bryn and Riku are heading east for the State Fair, which starts tomorrow. </p>
<p>It was one busy household for a couple of hours, with four children buzzing around, playing upstairs, downstairs, outside, and sitting at the table eating/drawing and chatting to each other, and the adults. Bryn and Doug went off to pick up a rental car, while Kevin sat building Lego with Finn. They had hoped to leave at 10 A.M., but it was almost 11:30 when we went out to wave goodbye to them. </p>
<p>Caillie and I sat down to read in the living room for a while, talking about what to do today. I didn't have much energy at all, and neither did she, so she decided that lunch at "Barney's", one of the restaurants on her list, would be perfect. Doug was off having lunch with a friend, so Caillie and I drove to Noe Valley and parked up a block from 24th on a steep hilly street. </p>
<p>Lunch was delicious, as always, although I am just not used to big meals anymore, so the tofu burger — the "plain" one at that, no barbecue sauce, or avocado — and half the order of fries filled me up so much that I had a fruit bowl for dinner. Caillie enjoyed hers as she always does, as well as a chocolate milkshake. </p>
<p>We were full, and tired, and it was <strong>hot</strong> as we climbed up the hill to the car. Caillie had me in stitches, making up excuses as to why we should keep stopping, pretending to admire the view behind us every few steps. I was so tired that I forgot my camera, a very unusual thing for me ... so no photos of the first thing on Caillie's to-do list. I would normally have taken a photo of her with her veggie burger and shake, and perhaps one of her standing outside the restaurant. </p>
<p>It was certainly an Ocean Beach day, and we were both tempted to head out that way, but we hadn't thought of it ahead of time, didn't have our books with us, and of course I didn't have my camera ... and it was hot too! We dragged ourselves home and up the stairs and there we stayed put, the entire afternoon and evening. </p>
<p>Caillie curled up in the corner chair in the living room, covered with a blanket, and I stretched out on the sofa, reading too, until I drifted off into a deep sleep for about a half hour. Caillie had discovered my crafts drawer, with some special papers and fun things I had been saving for her  and the children, so she was happy working away on that for a bit. </p>
<p>Caillie also spent some time examining an American penny, which she told me had a picture of a man reading ... a novel? a comic book? the paper? ... and he was drinking a cup of something ... a Coke!, coffee perhaps? Sitting on a log?, a dock? and on she went with all sorts of possibilities. One of the things she did when we first got home was borrow a magnifying glass and fill me in on what was really going on with Abraham Lincoln. He is sitting on a log, reading (but of course no idea what) and did indeed have a cup of something beside him, but no further clues were discovered. What a funny girl she is! </p>
<p>Eventually we roused ourselves enough to play cards, followed by dinner at home, more cards, and tea for two. </p>
<p>Bryn called and told us that Riku had slept for the first hour of the trip, until they stopped for lunch in Vacaville, and then called later to tell us they had just spent two hours in the hotel pool, and had lots of fun. I spoke briefly to Riku too, and he sounded happy to be there. How nice for him to get away with his daddy. They're sharing a hotel room, just the two of them, and I think they will both have a great time on this trip. </p>
<p>Caillie and I finished up our day with a final game of Aces, and then she headed for bed at 10:30. It's wonderful having Caillie here with me! </p>
