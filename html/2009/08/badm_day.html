								<h2>BADM Day with Auntie Susan and Finn</h2>
								<p>Riku decided he would like one more day at the Bay Area Discovery Museum, so today was the day. Susan emailed in the early morning, wondering if we might be interested in going, as she was taking Finn. Riku and Caillie both were delighted to hear that we would meet up with them there. </p>
<p>Before leaving, though, Riku and I watched the last part of "Chicken Run". Riku got lots of laughs out of the happy ending and how it came about, and I enjoyed watching it with him. He and Caillie drew at the table while I packed up a big lunch with snacks, as we would be off to swimming not long after we got home. </p>
<p>Riku's left leg was bothering him, especially when sitting in the car. He asked if it was growing pains, as he can't remember hurting it, and I told him it could be, as his Daddy used to get them in his legs too when he was that age. He was limping on it for part of the time, and so we started our day at the painting and activity room painting with Finn. </p>
<p>It loosened up enough that he ended up having lots of fun at the playground too. Finn did whatever activity Riku suggested — on the boat, into the cave, digging in the gravel pit, climbing the hill to ring the bell — but they spent a huge amount of time in the twig house, playing hide and seek. Auntie Susan joined Caillie in the finding too, and I got to take lots of fun photos of the four of them running and hiding. Finn ran and laughed and hid along with them all, squealing when he got found. </p>
<p>We had stopped for lunch at 11:30, and since it was fairly windy and the fog hadn't quite lifted, Riku found a table for us inside the small lunch room. Everyone ate well (we were all hungry),  and Susan and I enjoyed our hot drinks along with our lunches. </p>
<p>Finn and Susan left first, for Finn's nap, and then we left reluctantly at 1:30, with a promise to stop in at the gift shop. Caillie bought a tiny box of tiny shells for a friend, and I bought Riku a box of the same shells, and five golden coins for his treasure box at home. </p>
<p>Riku had a swimming lesson at 3 o'clock today, and so there was time for just a little snack and a bit of time at home before leaving for Pacifica. Unfortunately, the instructor Riku had liked so much, and had done so well with last week, called in sick and Riku had a new teacher. He was spending a lot of time in the corner with her, which surprised us, as he had been swimming across the pool last week with his face underwater for much of it. This gal had him sitting a little too far back on the side of the pool at one point, and we could see that he didn't want her pulling him into the water.</p>
<p> It was the first lesson when he wasn't grinning and laughing and enjoying it all, and about fifteen minutes into the lesson, he was crying! Of course it was very upsetting for all of us, and I asked at the desk if I should take him out. I was told that it would be best to let him finish the lesson, but it sure was tough to sit there! The last eight minutes or so, he was still looking sad, but enjoyed the last few minutes of throwing the ball back and forth to his teacher. When I went to him with his towel once he was finished the lesson, though, he burst into tears again. </p>
<p>We talked while I toweled him off and dressed him, and by the time we got to the car he was feeling better. The biggest issue for him was that the teacher told him she wouldn't let go of him in the water, and she did. He just didn't trust her after that, and it all went downhill from there. </p>
<p>Krispy Kreme doughnuts are on Caillie's to-do list, and this was Riku's last day to get them, so off we went for that special treat. Riku stayed in the car with me for the first time, and Caillie and Doug went in for two big doughnuts for each of them, and Riku's two favourite glazed tiny ones. </p>
<p>There had been some discussion in the morning about Riku spending some time over these last three days with three friends from school. We set up something via phone messages for today, after the class, and I wasn't sad when it didn't work out, as Riku needed some time with Caillie at home. They watched part of the chipmunk movie Riku had asked for from Netflix, we had a nice dinner together downstairs, and both did a drawing as well. Caillie drew a fantastical fish with lots of colours.  </p>
<p>I told Riku I wanted him to have just a five-minute tub to get the chlorine off his skin. He agreed, but then called me into the bathroom and asked me to watch him put his face under the water. I counted as he held his breath to the count of 21(!), and then 27. He was so very pleased with himself, as well he should be, and I called Doug in to see this too. This final time he went to the count of 31! We were so pleased and so proud of him, as he obviously did not lose his faith in himself despite the bad lesson. He was spluttering, and didn't use the "safe cloth" to wipe his eyes, but just blinked a lot and tossed the hair back from his forehead.Doug explained to him that he could exhale while still under water, and I taped him, as he wanted to know if we could see the bubbles he thus made. <br />
. <br />
While Riku was bathing, Caillie went into her room with my camera set to video, to record a song she had written today. I listened through the closed door for a few minutes, and was once again astounded at her amazing voice! I'm hoping she finishes her song off before she leaves, so we can capture one full version. She was having trouble remembering the tune, and of course I was of no help to her at all. </p>
<p>Riku wanted Caillie to sit with him in bed, going through a catalogue of Hallowe'en costumes, and then I went in and read "Just in Case" to him again. </p>
<p>Bryn came in just as we were finishing up dinner, and after he and Doug came back from a Rainbow run (while I was tucking Riku in), Bryn had a game of Spades with us. </p>
<p>He went out for the evening, so Caillie and I had our usual game of Aces, which she won once again! She went off to bed at 10 to read, and I spent a half hour on the computer, before heading up to bed. </p>
