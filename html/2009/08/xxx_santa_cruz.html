								<h2>Santa Cruz!</h2>
								<p>We were hoping to do Santa Cruz with both Caillie and Riku, but the timing just didn't work out (Riku had swimming lessons booked, and friends to see), so yesterday we set off with Caillie for one of the last items on her to-do list.</p>
<p>Doug and I had two errands to do first. Doug had an appointment at 9 A.M. and, as a result, is now signed up for Medicare, which means he will have health insurance coverage here as of October! Yahoo! I went to get a much needed hair cut but learned that my gal doesn't start work on Mondays until noon, so that has to wait until tomorrow, my last day at home for a month. </p>
<p>The day was perfect for our trip south, not too hot, and not too cool, but just right! We stopped, as has now become our tradition, in Capitola, a tiny town just outside Santa Cruz, for lunch at "Dharma's", a vegetarian restaurant. Caillie knew without looking at the menu that she would be having her favourite burrito there, I had a wonderful white bean and basil soup, a huge and delicious side salad, and a serving of brown rice. It was all delicious. Doug had a breakfast burrito, one of his favourite dishes at this spot. </p>
<p>We spent a lovely couple of hours there, first walking out to the end of the wharf to check out the view and the sea lions. There were a few in the usual spot under the wharf, but today we saw lots of them along the south side of the wharf as well. And, much to our delight, found some very laid back sea lions basking and rocking gently in someone's catamaran! </p>
<p>Caillie was only interested in doing the big roller coaster ride, as she and her family will be here during March break next year. She decided she would rather go on the other rides with them, and so she and her grandfather went on two roller coaster rides together. They were both disappointed in the first one, but had a great time, as always, on the one that gives them a long classic high ride, rather than the quick bends and shorter dips on the first ride. I prefer neither! </p>
<p>We bought some salt water taffy too, as that was the second thing Caillie wanted in Santa Cruz. It's now available at Pier 39, but she waited until she could get it where she always has. I noticed the open bag beside her bed while she was reading tonight. </p>
<p>After arriving home, we had a quick dinner made up of things in the fridge that won't keep, and then Caillie and I went upstairs to eat while watching the end of "Bringing up Baby". It ended happily, of course, with the protaganists in love. I have suggested to Doug that he watch it on his own before sending it back to Netflix. Such fun to see Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant oh-so-many years ago. </p>
<p>I had to do a Creative Memories order to buy extra sheets for my albums ... the company is changing the size of their albums(!), and so Caillie, with pen and paper in hand, went with me from spot to spot, helping me count how many pages and protectors I need for them all. It was a biggish job and went much faster with my secretary close by. </p>
<p>Bryn wrote to let me know that Riku had awakened happily at 7:30 this morning, despite awaking a few times during the night. He walked to school on his own, and when Bryn showed up a little later on, after biking there with extra school supplies for Riku, he was happily engaged in conversation with his classmates. Mirei starts back at her French Immersion program tomorrow, although is protesting, saying she would rather go to the Japanese preschool program she attended for a session this summer. </p>
<p>She and Riku are happy to be back in each other's company, and she is making them all laugh with a new trick ... turning her tongue upside down and then sticking it out! What a girl! In just one month and three days I will have her with me for a couple of weeks. </p>
<p>The evening passed too quickly as always, and I went off to bed at 11 P.M. tonight. All the fresh air and walking today made me too tired to stay up too late. Just as well ... tomorrow will be a very busy day, packing up for a month away. </p>
