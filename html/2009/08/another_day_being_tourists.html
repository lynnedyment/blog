								<h2>Another Day Being Tourists</h2>
								<p>The plan for today, after our two gorgeous days of hot, clear weather, was to walk the Golden Gate Bridge with Caillie, something we do each time she is here. It's on her list!  :) However, living on the west coast means that the weather changes constantly and quickly and so we woke to low-hanging fog today, and it was still hanging about at noon. </p>
<p>So we had a lazy morning at home, all of us happy not to be dashing out immediately. Caillie has been busy with my craft drawer since she arrived, making colourful cards, writing letters to a friend, and to Gregg's mom, but also just poking about with all the paper, stickers, and soft wires, and lots of glue and tape too! She sat at the table as busy as could be, while I got at the laundry, got a couple of emails out, and cleared things away. </p>
<p>When it was clear that we weren't going to walk the bridge, which is not fun at all when it's covered with fog (cold and with no view), we changed plans, and decided to go to see Andy Goldsworthy's "The Spire", and decide from there what to do next. Caillie saw "Fault Line" last year so she has two of Goldsworthy's pieces under her belt now. She keeps a tiny journal she started when she was just three years old, on her trip to visit us in England, and has kept it up each trip with us since. </p>
<p>Doug suggested we go to the Pet Cemetery in the Presidio.. At first Caillie wasn't sure about this, but she enjoyed it very much. It's very touching as there are sweet dedications to beloved pets, just tiny and not elaborate, but heart-felt for sure, to the pets of soldiers and officers at the base, dating mostly from WW1 and WWII. The site is in pretty sad condition; the Boy Scouts used to take care of it, but haven't for a few years, and now just recently many trees have been cut down to make room for bridge repairs, and it all looks quite neglected. We wandered about reading out the inscriptions on the markers to each other, and looking at the photos of some of the pets. </p>
<p>From there we went to the Palace of Fine Arts, as Caillie had not been there before. It's a lovely spot, with lots of photo opportunities, so we spent perhaps a half hour there just wandering about. I hope to do this with Kelly, Gregg, and the four children when they come in March. </p>
<p>Chinatown is also on Caillie's to-do list, and so we had Doug drop us off a block from the "dragon gate" that officially marks this area. We had such a good time, laughing our way up one side of the street and down the other, warning each other not to look at the hanging barbecued ducks in the windows. Ugh! Our plan had been to have lunch in Chinatown, and we checked out a few menus, but nothing really appealed to us. It might have had something to do with those dead ducks. We went in and out of a few stores, as Caillie thought she might find something fun to take home as a souvenir, but nothing clicked, and we were ready for lunch. </p>
<p>Caillie had a yen for sushi, and if we had had more time, we would have taken a bus to Japantown, but instead walked to the big shopping centre at the cable car turnaround point on Market Street. There was only one very expensive sushi restaurant there, so we walked over to Macy's, checked out their food area, and hit the jackpot! Caillie ordered two plates, one a California roll and one cucumber. There were twelve pieces in all and she enjoyed every bite of  it. I had my favourite Boudin sourdough roll filled with tuna salad; it has been many months since I've had one, and it was delicious. </p>
<p>We lucked out by catching a bus within three minutes of standing at the bus stop at Union Square, transferred to the #19 bus to Potrero Hill within five minutes, and got home about 6 P.M. I was tired and ready for a hot cup of tea, but also had lots to do, and managed to do both. Caillie is trying hard to finish up a library book, and she spent some time on the computer too. Our evenings fly by quickly! </p>
<p>An hour and a half later, Doug and I drove to El Toro to pick up a burrito for Caillie's dinner. We made another stop at Taqueria Can-CÃºn on Mission Street to pick one up for Doug (he is no longer an El Toro fan), and I had some fruit for dinner, still full from my late lunch. Caillie and I went upstairs to watch a movie she had Doug rent for us from Netflix, an oldie called "Bringing up Baby", with Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant. It was just delightful; I think she had seen it a few years ago with either her dad or mom, and thought I would enjoy it too. I did, although we stopped it at 9 o'clock so that Caillie could get to bed, read, and have her light out by 9:30. </p>
<p>I am just starting to panic at all that needs doing before leaving for Toronto on Wednesday. We're off to Santa Cruz tomorrow, and that gives me one day to organize the packing, trying not to forget all the extras I want to take with me, getting through as many emails as I can, as I may not have a computer for a month, and a dozen other little jobs that must be done before we leave. Bed too late at midnight, and I read too long after that too! Who <strong>do</strong> I see about getting more hours in my day?</p>
