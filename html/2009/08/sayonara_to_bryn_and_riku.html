								<h2>Sayonara to Bryn and Riku, and a Touristy Day for Caillie and Me</h2>
								<p>Riku called out during the night, and even though I was sure he would fall back to sleep on his own, I decided to have a few hours with him, and perhaps have him sleep in a little later this morning as well. It worked, as he awoke at 7:10, and was very happy to find me there, waiting to read to him. He ate his fruit bowl while we snuggled and read, for the last time in too long. </p>
<p>We had heard about a "science" experiment for children, using Mountain Dew soda, baking soda, and peroxide, and decided today was the day to try it out. It was supposed to turn a fluorescent green in the dark when mixed together, but to our disappointment, nothing at all happened. It turned out to be a hoax, as Doug learned, but the failed experiment made Riku decide to try some others. So, out came the vinegar, the baking soda, some cinnamon, a little oil, and a few other last minute ideas... green fluid made from mixing one of his marking pens in water, and a funnel. This kept Riku busy for the longest time, and it was lots of fun to watch him being so serious about it all. </p>
<p>Packing was well underway not long after Bryn woke, as I had most of Riku's belongings on the sofa, and some of Bryn's too. He got busy filling their two suitcases, and had most of it done when an old friend from Vancouver, Mark Henderson, stopped by with his girlfriend Meridith, to have breakfast with Bryn. They arrived in town just last night, so it was to be a very quick visit, unfortunately. </p>
<p>Caillie slept in quite late too, but was up and showered by the time that they all arrived back at the house. Meridith was very sweet with Riku, sitting on the floor going through his tin box of insects and snakes, and talking to him about them all ... which were their favourites, which would make a better pet, etc. It was great to see Mark again and to meet Meridith. Riku showed them his art work, stored on Doug's computer, and the time went by quickly. They left after we took what has become our traditional "photo with guests", and Riku gets right into his usual position on the top of the sofa. </p>
<p>Riku and Caillie had time to watch two short episodes of "Casper", and Riku had the third part of his breakfast upstairs. I packed up his snacks and a sandwich for the plane, Bryn lightened Riku's very heavy backpack to make room for them, and to make that pack lighter too! </p>
<p>I was feeling very sad as I realized that, with every thing we did, it was going to be the last time, for a long time. Riku told me not to get rid of any more toys as he will be back, and I got lots of impulsive extra hugs and kisses too. In the night, when he was lying there, he said very quietly, "I don't want to go home." I don't think he was saying it to me, but this morning he was very excited at the prospect of seeing Mirei and his mommy. That made me feel much better! He said Mirei would be very glad to have him home again, as she really likes the cat game he plays with her; he is the cat, and Mirei is his "mommy". </p>
<p>So, of course the time came too quickly to leave the house. Caillie and I sat with him in the back seat. Riku pointed out the hill that he didn't climb with his daddy this trip; it was on his list, and so I promised it would be on the list for next summer. We chatted all the way to the airport, just a ten minute drive, so not long at all, and said our goodbyes at the curb. He's very excited about this trip alone with his Dad, watching movies, and being on their way home. </p>
<p>It was a hot day again, so I was ready to just sit and put my feet up when we got home. Caillie worked on the last of three letters to a friend, and we went off to mail that for today's pickup. Not much later, we had decided to do Ghiradelli Square, for a hot fudge sundae, as well as walk to Pier 39 to see the sea lions. </p>
<p>First came the hot fudge sundae! We shared it, though Caillie could have eaten a whole one on her own, so I put down my spoon and let her finish it off. The whole area was just packed and we were dodging folks all the way to Pier 39. </p>
<p>There were more sea lions today than I have ever seen before, and the stench was pretty awful. We didn't linger, but wandered about window shopping; Caillie went into a couple of stores, and we enjoyed the much cooler air in this part of the city. </p>
<p>Caillie was pretty tuckered out from a too late bedtime last night, and was happy to head home after the long walk back to the Square. </p>
<p>A plain cheese pizza from Amici's was on Caillie's list too, and so Doug and I placed our order, and went to pick it up, while Caillie had some computer time on her own here. The pizza was delicious, and she and I had two games of cards after we finished, as well as our tea. Caillie is drinking herbal tea, which is great, as I seldom use it and she is enjoying it so much. </p>
<p>Bed early for Caillie tonight; she read until 9:30, I wrote just a few emails ... I'm so far behind now, I can't begin to catch up, and chose my blog photos too. </p>
<p>I'm tired, emotionally and physically, and am going off to bed to read my wonderful hard-to-put-down book "Too Many Men"; it's not a light and easy book, but a page turner for certain, and I am reading much later than I should be these nights! </p>
<p>I hope Riku is sleeping soundly on the plane, along with his Dad. They've been flying now for nine hours and must be getting close to Korea, where they will wait for their connection to Osaka. </p>
