								<h2>A Quiet Saturday</h2>
								<p>Caillie only slept until 8:30 this morning, much to my surprise. Partly as a result, I'm sure, of her early rising and my too short night as well, we had another lazy day again, which seemed to suit us both. Caillie and I had a leisurely breakfast, played cards, took long showers, and played cards again, although she has beat me all but one game so far!  </p>
<p>Our big plan for the day was a movie with Doug after lunch at home; we all thoroughly enjoyed "Julie and Julia", munching away on our refillable container of popcorn ... one and a half of them for $6.50. Yum! I always feel it's a good deal, as I never want anything more to eat except for a fruit bowl for the rest of the day. </p>
<p>A quick trip to Costco was next, for another pineapple, and more fruit, but it was very crowded and it took much longer than we expected it to. It was close enough to dinner time that we drove to El Toro to pick up the veggie burrito that Caillie has on her list of things to eat. She loves to sit and watch a movie here at home while eating it, as she and Bryn did last year, so she and I watched "The Sound of Music". Caillie was fading fast, though and so we stopped just a little more than halfway through it, and shall finish up another night. It has been a long time since I watched it, and I thoroughly enjoyed Caillie singing along to all of the songs, and even acting out some of it. She had been to a drama camp this summer, and played the part of one of the nuns, so she had it all down pat. What a lovely voice this child has! I must record her. </p>
<p>We did lots of reading and card playing and chatting today, but tomorrow we hope to have more energy and do something on Caillie's list. It just wasn't a beach day at all, with heavy fog covering the city, so different from the heat and sun we had yesterday (!) and we were fine with just staying put. </p>
<p>I got a message from Bryn at the end of the day, letting us know that Riku was asleep ... at 10:30 P.M. I know the plan for the fair, which started today, was to head off in the morning, go back to the hotel for a nap and a swim, and then be at the fair in the evening too, so I imagine all went as planned. Can't wait to hear all about it! </p>
