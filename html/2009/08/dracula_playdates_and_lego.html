								<h2>Dracula, Playdates, Lego, and Ghosts ... Busters, That Is!</h2>
								<p>Riku came bouncing into our room this morning, cuddled up under the warm blankets and told me he had the <strong>best</strong> dream last night. He was a vampire and it was <strong>fun</strong>! I told him to stay away from my neck, and he thought that was the funniest thing to say. It's so easy to make Riku laugh; the sillier the better for him. He was anxious to get back to finishing off his Lego plane, so he sat at the table busy with that until every piece was in place. This kit had over 280 pieces, and he placed each one himself, following the manual with no assistance at all.  He has done bigger ones than this, he told me, but we are certainly impressed with his ability to sit with it on his own and just do it.</p>
<p>Riku has to turn in one drawing for each day of his vacation time; talk about the perfect homework assignment for this boy! Today he did two, before spending some time with me finding Waldo, praising me when I found one he hadn't seen before. It's fun sitting side by side, searching out Waldo, and his girlfriend, their dog, the "bad guy", the Wizard, and three tiny tiny bits that Riku has only twice managed to find ... me, never ... a bone, a stack of plates, and a scroll. It's almost impossible to find them, but the searching together is a treat. <br />
 <br />
Kai's father had emailed last night, asking if Riku and Kai could get together today. Riku decided he did not want to meet at Kai's playground, determined that he picked up his rash there, so they went to a different playground instead. He skipped all the way to Kai's house, chatting away happily. They spent two hours there, and Riku came home looking happy and well exercised at 12:30. </p>
<p>His swimming class today was at 1:30, so he had an hour and a bit to relax and eat lunch. He started a new Lego set, this one of three various houses. First he put together a tiny little table set for lunch, and called me in to see it. He had lunch in the dining room, while he continued working on it, right 'til the last minute. </p>
<p>Bryn came with us to the pool today, and watched Riku with Pam, a new instructor. Riku continues to smile away all through his lessons, and we all liked the way Pam was with him during his class. He is going to have her again tomorrow. We stopped for two mini doughnuts at Riku's request, and Bryn decided to treat himself to a burger at "In-and-Out Burger", an old favourite spot for take-out. </p>
<p>Riku had more Lego time at home, and about a half hour of "The Ghost Busters", a movie he had asked us to get for him. We rented it from Netflix and it arrived today, much to Riku's delight. He and Doug watched a half hour of it, before going with Bryn for a visit with Amelia, Finn, Susan, and Kevin. He had a little telephone chat with Auntie Susan beforehand too. </p>
<p>The time flew by quickly, as it no doubt did for Bryn and Riku too. They had Amici's pizza for dinner, watched part of "Scooby-Doo", played, and arrived home at 7.</p>
<p>Doug and I had a quiet dinner together; I answered emails about the family tree, and chose some photos for the blog. However, the doorbell rings, and, always, there stands Riku with a big smile for me. Life is good! </p>
<p>I saw some really sweet photos of Mirei today and yesterday; she is looking more grown up, of course, and I can't wait to see her in October. </p>
<p>Caillie arrives in just five days and we are looking forward to having her here with us for two weeks. </p>
<p> Riku had a nice deep tub, playing with his newly found monsters. As I was drying him off, he put his hands together, as if praying, and said solemnly "I wish I could dream about being a vampire again." ...  and then ended his day with a little bit more time for Lego, of course! </p>
<p>We are still reading Shel Silverstein's "Falling Up", but we are close to the end of the book. Soon time to choose our next one! </p>
