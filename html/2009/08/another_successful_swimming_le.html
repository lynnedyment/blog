								<h2>Another Successful Swimming Lesson</h2>
								<p>We spent a quiet morning at home today, as Riku's swimming lesson was just after lunch, and I didn't want a tuckered-out boy going for his lesson. He started to worry about it mid-morning, with tummy aches, and complaints about not wanting to go. The morning was fun for him though, as we watched the second forty-five minute segment of "Spiderman" together, he spent some time on the Internet (having figured out how to log into the craft section of the Crayola site), and then "drew" using a new program that Doug installed for him. He now knows his way around his own "Riku's Favourites" on my desktop, so he can just go through all the various bits we have added to it over the past few years. He even dragged one into the "trash" following my instructions. </p>
<p>He helped Doug put away the large supplies of toilet paper and tissues this morning; he loves to help and be involved and I was happy to have him opening the big packages with scissors and then deliver it all to Doug in the storage room. After it was done, he decided it would be fun to cut the plastic covering into little bits, possibly hundreds of little bits. What a mess! I told him he hadn't made that big a mess since he was one year old, and pulled out all the plastic bags from my cupboard. He had a great ol' time, and had fun flinging it all up into the air when he had finished. Of course, then he got to pick it up and realized just how many pieces he had cut! </p>
<p>He drew a great picture of various monsters today, and one day I must put up an entry or two with his latest drawings. I notice he is not using colour as much as he used to, although sometimes he will go back and colour them once he has done the major drawing in black on white paper. </p>
<p>I made corn soup for lunch today, and Riku helped me break up the kernels to add to the pot. He was sorting through his books when I began the actual cooking, so he offered to help me another day. I got big compliments on the soup, though, as he told me it was really really good, and he ate every bite without any urging. He was happy to know that his dad liked the soup when he was a little boy too. </p>
<p>Once Riku is in the pool area, his fears seem to abate, or at least he has decided there is no point in talking about it! He watches the other swimmers carefully, and once his name is called he is up and on his way to the far end of the pool area. Taryn was Riku's swimming instructor today and again he lucked out, as both Doug and I felt she did a great job. I put in a request for her, and Jessica is also on his "preferred" list, as one particular teacher we saw there would just not have worked for him. </p>
<p>Riku seemed to enjoy it once more, and we were so happy to see him floating more comfortably, with his head being held, and also moving on his own for the first time that we could see. They tend to stay down at the shallow end of the pool, of course, and so it's hard to see exactly what is going on. However, this little boy came bursting out of the pool telling me "That was <strong>great</strong>! </p>
<p>The instructors make notes on their file sheet after the lesson, but there is no direct contact with them at all. However, I went to check on the name of the woman whom we don't want to teach him, and his own teacher told me that Riku had done really well today. How wonderful to hear that, as it meant he has come a long way from that one lesson before. </p>
<p>This morning he told me he wanted a Krispy Kreme doughnut after swimming today, after all, as he had decided on Monday that he didn't want any more. Then before we left he told us he didn't want one, but once we got on the road he changed his mind again. When he was getting changed after his lesson he said to me "I sure change my mind a lot. First I want a doughnut and then I don't. Then I do. Then I say I don't like swimming, and then I do, and then I don't, and now I do!" At least he knows himself and can no doubt see what is going on there with the swimming especially. I'm hoping he remembers this for next Monday, so he can happily anticipate his next class. </p>
<p>We had some errands to run, and the first stop was at Krispy Kreme for that doughnut with chocolate icing and coloured sprinkles on it. We stopped at the library for Doug, although Riku and I sat in the car chatting. I want to take Riku to one of our public swimming pools in the Mission and needed to pick up their schedule. The pool is in a large playground/soccer field complex, and Riku asked if we could stay there for a while. Doug had his book with him, and we spent an hour and a bit there, watching Riku go from one area to another. </p>
<p>I realized today just how much learning Riku does by carefully observing other children. It takes some time before he decides he can do something, and I can almost see him thinking about trying it, and then he does, carefully for certain, but going for it. His cousin Bryn was and may still be still the same way. Caillie would just go for it, as does Mirei, but not these boys. Interesting to see this process. </p>
<p>Quiet time at home for the rest of the evening. Riku went through the book of the body very very carefully, page by page, asking me to explain anything that wasn't obvious to him. We talked about autopsies, and how doctors hundreds of years ago didn't used to know for sure what was inside the body. We talked about X-rays, and bones, and skeletons, until it was tub time and then dinner. He ate a huge dinner tonight, brown rice mushroom risotto, with sides of veggies, and he chose grapes for dessert. </p>
<p>Bryn was out for the evening, and didn't come home after work today, and Doug was at his class, so Riku and I had a very quiet evening, and he was tucked into bed at 7:20 tonight, with time for many pages of Shel Silverstein's poems, and some talk about hypnotism too. Riku was asleep before 8 tonight, a tired boy after the swimming and the running around at the playground. </p>
<p>(Kelly is in Nanaimo with Gail and Tom today. She flew in this morning, they had dinner out at the "Fox and Hounds" pub where I found the wonderful hard cider when we were there, and tomorrow they are off for brunch at "Penny's Palapa." I even had a little IM chat with her, a rare occurrence!) </p>
