								<h2>Not a Quiet Sunday!</h2>
								<p>I hadn't realized that Bryn and Riku were coming back from Sacramento so early today. We had made plans to have lunch at "Fresh Choice", a big California buffet that all the older grandchildren like, and of course it's on Caillie's list. </p>
<p>We were going to leave at 11:30, so I especially was having a very relaxed morning, still in my dressing gown when the doorbell rang, as only Riku rings it, and up he came, bursting with so many stories, and carrying a container with two goldfish swimming about. Bryn had to have the rental car back at 11 A.M., so off he dashed, with Doug following not too much later to pick him up. We did get to hear that Riku had won a fish and the kind vendor let Amelia have one too. Riku is going to keep them here, until he leaves for Japan, at which point Amelia will have them at home. Amelia's fish is "Sparkley" and Riku named his "Bill". </p>
<p>Bryn and Susan assumed that neither of the children would be able to toss the ball that would win them a goldfish, and someone Riku got it on his first throw, much to Bryn's chagrin. Live creatures are not on Bryn's list of desirable prizes. We have our fingers crossed that they live longer than the last ones Riku brought home from Chinatown; I think that was two days! </p>
<p>Riku had eaten breakfast with Bryn, Susan, Kevin, and the children before coming home, but he had some fruit, and we heard all about the hotel, and all the swimming they did, and how he won a tiny blue bear, and a larger stuffed turtle too. What an excited boy he was; he told me that he wants to go next year, but wants me to go too. I would love it, says Riku, and I'm sure he's right. Bryn really liked the hotel too, and Riku enjoyed it all: the fair, the hotel room with his Daddy, and the swimming they did. </p>
<p>Riku was happy to discover that Caillie had brought two copies of "Finding Waldo" with her from home, and the two of them sat together on the sofa searching him and his cohorts out. Caillie has always been great at spotting these tiny characters, and Riku is as well, so they were finding them faster than Doug, Bryn, or I can! </p>
<p>As soon as the men were back with the car, Caillie, Riku, and I drove up to our local "playground on the hill". I tried hard to convince Riku to go to Golden Gate Park, or a new playground, but he was adamant that we not drive too far, which makes sense, given that he spent two hours getting home. That playground was crowded with lots of much younger children than is usual during the week, and it was really too windy and too crowded for Riku to play badminton with Caillie, which is what he really wanted to do. After a bit of climbing first, he and Caillie sat instead in the sandbox, something he rarely does at playgrounds anymore. It really was just too crowded for them to move around very fast.</p>
<p>Because of that, I did talk him into going to the Jackson Square playground, just a few blocks away, in case some of the children from school were there. He agreed, and we lucked out, as Skylar was there. Riku was quite shy about going over to play with her, but eventually they connected, and did some running around with Caillie, and even sat under the play equipment talking for a little while. </p>
<p>There was a great spot there for badminton, and even though the wind was blowing, Riku played enough that he was happy to put it aside and start running again. After Skylar left, another six-year-old girl asked Caillie to help her on one of the sliders, and soon all three of the children were dashing madly about. </p>
<p>Caillie was just wonderful, chasing them, and playing catch for well over an hour â€” how they loved it! They stopped for lots of drinks of water, used me for "base" to take a breath, and went right back to it. It was just the best thing in the world for Riku and Caillie, as they both got all that fresh air and exercise, and worked up a great appetite! </p>
<p>He went right into the tub when he got home, and I made big bowls of "chicken" noodle and veggie soup for dinner. There was just enough time for them to do some drawing together before they ate, while I iced the carrot cake for dessert;  it was a hit, so full tummies all 'round. </p>
<p>Caillie read Riku his bedtime story tonight, while I cleared up the kitchen. I snuck in to take a peek... sooo sweeet! I got in my final snuggle of the day, and he was quickly asleep at 7:30 tonight, and Caillie and I had tea, played cards (yes, she won again!), and she read while I got in some computer time. Caillie was in bed reading at 9:30 though, with lights out at 10 P.M. I was up to bed early too, for a nice change.</p>
<p>P.S. Beth emailed news with photos of her new grandson, EJ and Mel's beautiful big baby boy, Tristin Matthew, born at 2:01 this afternoon in Ontario, weighing in at a hefty 9 pounds, 7 ounces! So, I have another great-nephew in the world tonight. Happy news! </p>
