								<h2>A Card for Me,   Swimming Lesson, and Some Basketball Time too!</h2>
								<p>Riku had his first of seven private swimming lessons scheduled for 11:30 this morning, so we spent a quiet morning at home. Riku asked me for one of the blank cards and envelopes I keep on hand, as he wanted to "write a note, not draw a picture" for me today. I read the paper at the table, promising not to peek while he did my card. It took him quite a long time and he didn't ask me how to spell any of the words at all. I didn't realize this until just now, many hours later! I think this was a first! On the front he put an American flag on one side, for me, and a Japanese flag on the other side, representing him. I did suggest that next time he could do a Canadian flag for me, but he said that was too hard! I think all the points on the maple leaf lead him to believe he won't do it properly. I'll work on that. The card was very touching; what loving thoughts go through this little boy's head. The drawing on the card shows our meeting at the airport, with the overhead monitor which let us know when they were coming out of customs and immigration, and with Bryn coming in behind him carrying the luggage. </p>
<p>At 11 o'clock we left the house. Riku was quite apprehensive about this class, and was very quiet on the way there. He had told me several times in the morning that he just didn't want to go to this lesson. Poor wee guy; it couldn't possibly be as bad as he thinks it is going to be.</p>
<p>He is just beginning to learn to swim at school in Japan, and he was stressed about that too. It just makes sense that with these seven private lessons he will gain some confidence, and if he's not swimming by the time he leaves, at least we hope he will be more confident in the water. Fingers crossed. </p>
<p>Of course the lesson went beautifully. I thought his teacher, one of three, was just the best fit for Riku's personality. She was very quiet and gentle with him, and it was obvious he trusted her and felt secure. Doug and I sat on a nearby bench at this small inside pool, and watched as he floated on his back, with his head supported, tried both water wings and fins, turned around with minimal help, and even slid off the edge of the pool, with Jennifer holding onto his hands. He told us he landed on her knee. I liked her so much that I requested her for him if she is available for any of his other classes. I hope this happens. </p>
<p>At the end of the class, the three children had a couple of minutes of free time, tossing a ball back and forth to one another. There was no other interaction at all during the class. </p>
<p>One of Riku's biggest fears is having his face underwater, but he has practiced this a bit in the tub each night here, and told me he did at home too. So, gradually, bit by bit, we hope this experience helps. His first sentence out of the water today was "That was <strong>fun</strong>!" He was pleased to know he was going to go again in three more days. Whew! </p>
<p>On the way home, Doug asked Riku if he liked doughnuts, and Riku answered that he "sort of did, if it was the kind with icing and sprinkles". So we stopped at Krispy Kreme and picked up a mini doughnut Riku chose for himself (with chocolate icing and sprinkles), two for Doug, and one for Bryn. I declined, as I would rather have chocolate. </p>
<p>I had told Riku the lesson would make him very hungry, and I guess he believed me as he ate an extra big lunch of mac' and cheese, as well as a generous plate of broccoli, and that was after the cinnamon toast he ate on the way home! </p>
<p>He was anxious to play with Kai again today, but he's at a summer camp program each afternoon until 3:45. However, I called his mom and we arranged to meet at the park at 4:15 for a short playtime. Riku and I had a leisurely stroll over there, stopping in to say hello to Lily first. She noticed Riku was taller, and thought he looked slimmer too. They were happy to see each other and shared a big hug. </p>
<p>Riku and I discovered the playground is closed for two days for cleaning and some reconstruction, so we waited for Kai at his house, and they both decided they wanted to come back here to play. They ran and laughed all the way home, hiding from me in the most obvious spots, and then just howling when I pretended to be scared when they jumped out at me. Once here, they shot some basketballs in the back garden, and had a snack. The hour and twenty minutes went by quickly, and Doug dropped Kai off at home at 5:30, on his way to his class.</p>
<p>I got Riku right into the tub, and he was singing and playing in there happily when Bryn came home. He filled daddy in on the swimming lesson, and ate another really good-sized meal tonight. I had a fresh fruit bowl sprinkled with crushed flax seed for my dinner, and Riku "snuck" a couple of strawberries during his meal. After dinner, he asked if he could have that for dessert. I don't think there are too many six year olds who would consider this a treat. Both Bryn and Doug would have turned it down, but I told Riku all of my sisters would like it too. He decided Sean would too, as we were talking today about how Sean is very healthy and takes good care of himself. </p>
<p>Riku had the donut first for dessert but decided after he ate it that he really would have liked maybe just half of it, and I have a feeling he is going to turn down the offer to stop the next time. He's just not a sweets eater ... ice cream isn't even a treat for him, and it wasn't for his cousin Bryn either. They may be the only two children I know who don't like ice cream! </p>
<p>Bryn was home for dinner and part of the evening with us, went off to visit Soo, and then spent some time with Sean and Bern after that. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep just after 8 P.M. tonight, and I am heading up now for bed at 11 o'clock, having accomplished absolutely nothing tonight, unless I count working three sudoku puzzles. Ah well, some days are just like that ... lazy lazy for some reason. Yawn! </p>
