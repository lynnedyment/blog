								<h2>A Morning Playdate and a Quiet Afternoon</h2>
								<p>I heard Riku on the monitor at 6:40 this morning, chatting happily away to himself, and so came down and joined him in his bed. He didn't want to eat right away, but wanted to "just talk", so talk we did. He was disappointed that he didn't have a dream about being a vampire, and hoped he might tonight. </p>
<p>Somewhere, somehow, Riku has heard about heaven, and we have been discussing it now and then. However, today at breakfast he went into lots of detail about how nice it would be if it such a place really existed. The other day, after he had expressed his concern about my dying, and was talking about heaven, I told him I would meet him there. He was quick to point out that <strong>he</strong> would meet <strong>me</strong> there! </p>
<p>Today's scenario was quite elaborate. We will live together in a huge house with a big porch (this boy knows me well!), and with many rooms (one filled with Lego, one with treasures, mostly made of gold and silver). I hope there are cleaners in heaven 'cause cleaning this big place is <strong>not</strong> my idea of heaven at all! We decided wings would be fun, and we would both have "those gold rings around our heads" ... halos of course for both of us(!), we could listen to quiet music "not too loud 'cause I don't really like loud places", and on we went with our plans. </p>
<p>Riku has been wanting to have Amelia and/or Finn here for ages, but his mid-day swimming lessons, Amelia's busy summer camp and summer plans with family have made this hard to arrange. I promised him in bed last night that I would ask, and so it came to be this morning. Susan had been planning to head down the coast to the tide pools again today, as they had such fun there yesterday, but the fog was thick this morning, and it was quite cool near the water. Kevin dropped the children off, and they all had such a good time together. </p>
<p>Amelia and Riku played with the stuffed animals in the living room, doctoring them all very nicely with blankets, medicine, bandages, and cuddles. Finn, meanwhile, was building up a storm with the Tinker Toys. He's good at this, and accidentally knocked over the tallest one he made before I could get a photo of it. They went on to play outdoors for a bit, with the riding toys and bubbles, and then spent some time upstairs with the toys in our room. </p>
<p>The two older ones had to be reminded once in a while to include Finn, and they listened and did so. They were happy, though, when he got distracted with the cars and found a motorcycle amongst them, so that they could get on with their "science experiment", Riku's latest hobby.<br />
He has been making coloured water in plastic containers, waving his markers around in them until just the right colour emerges, and then freezing them. Sometimes cooking oil or bits of food, or sparkles from the craft drawer get added first. Then he finds a flat spot in the freezer and checks up on them now and then to see how they look. Breaking them up a bit at a time with a fork, and then refreezing them is part of the process too, and today Amelia was walked through it step by step. It was fun for her too, and she was going to try to do some at home. </p>
<p>The children had lunch together here, and then we were all off to our various afternoon activities. Riku had a <strong>great</strong> swimming lesson today, the best yet, with Pam again for the second time in a row. She's terrific, and he had his head underwater to the count of ten today, even though she asked him to go to three! He swam independently for a few strokes too, but I know he wouldn't do that without someone right there. It's been a big help for him, though, and I am planning on going swimming with him and Caillie at our local pool, just for some casual water play. He decided today would be a "two glazed doughnuts at the doughnut place" so we made a stop at Krispy Kreme. Doug suggested to Riku that they go to "Bob's" doughnut shop one day together, as they are his favourite local doughnuts. The two small ones are perfect for Riku right now, though, as he wouldn't eat one big one. It's surprising that he eats them at all, as sweets are not his favourite thing at all. I'm sure it's a passing phase and special because it comes as a special treat for him and his Grandpa.</p>
<p>We then all went off to Costco to pick up some fruit and a few extra things. Riku wanted to sit in the buggy, surprisingly, which was fine, as we didn't have much to get and got out faster than we had planned to. We had time for a stop at the library, and he and Doug came out with two new Shel Silverstein books, and a stack of others. One is all about pillbugs, which is great, as Riku finds lots of them in the garden and no doubt will learn even more about them now. </p>
<p>Riku and I both wanted to go to a playground, but he worked on his Lego house while I unpacked the groceries. He helped me do this, putting away the four pounds of butter in the freezer, and making room for the apples and blueberries.  While I did the rest, he decided he would make me a card, half of which he finished (the front of it, which he carefully covered so I couldn't see it until tomorrow when he does the inside).Riku spotted a deck of cards while he was working on the card, so we made up a game that gave two cards to whomever had the higher of the two as we placed them down together. It both cards matched, then we played another card and winner took all. Riku won the first game by a long shot, and then I won a game and he won the last of them. It was fun and I should pull out more card games for us.</p>
<p>By this time,  it was too late for the playground and instead we spent a half hour in the garden with the ball and "catching" mitts. I am not sure what they are called but Riku is getting better at throwing and catching and so am I! </p>
<p>We also had made plans to make a carrot cake tonight, but ran out of time and decided it would be a great early morning project instead. </p>
<p>Bryn came in just as I was leaving to run the tub, so they played for a bit, followed by Riku's bath, then dinner. I read a bit of one of the Shel Silverstein books to him, and while I tidied up after dinner, Bryn asked and answered questions about pillbugs (I bet you didn't know they can live to be five years old, but, sadly, usually don't).</p>
<p>We had decided on one last game of cards (Riku won), and then it was time for our bedtime routine. Riku was asleep at 7:55 tonight and made me promise, as always, that I would check on him at my bedtime and make sure that he was covered up. </p>
<p>Bryn was home for the evening, working in his room, and I wrote to Uncle Frank who is back online on his own computer after four month absence. It is so good to see those "Frank Massard" emails coming in again! </p>
