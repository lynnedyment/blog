								<h2>Happy Birthday, Don ... and Blasts from the Past!</h2>
								<p>It's Remembrance Day, and as well as the significance of it as a tribute to men and women who died while serving in the  Armed Services, it was also a day my mom said she would remember for sure, as she gave birth to her last child, Don (he turned 56 today).</p>
<p> I was working on photos this morning, adding more to some of my older posts whenever I noticed there was room for one or two more. Of course this meant I was looking into older photo files, and I thought how much fun it would be if, on days that I didn't have pictures to add to my daily entries, I posted photos from the same day from years gone by.</p>
<p>As I pulled photos for today ...  11/11, I thought it would be fun to make up an online album for Don. We always had such big fun birthday celebrations when we were kids. With ten children in the house, every birthday was an instant party! We didn't have much money, but no one ever had a party without streamers, and balloons, and pop (we are Canadians!), served in paper cups, which made it seem really special. Don is in Calgary with no siblings there to celebrate with him, so I was sure some memories of him with all of us might be a nice surprise for him. </p>
<p>I went through stacks of photos and pulled out a few years' worth, scanned them, and then was grateful for Doug's help in cropping, lightening or darkening them (why did people take photos with the sun in front of them?!), and putting them into a Kodak album for me. It was a fun project as each photo brought back lots of memories for me too! I sent it off and went to prepare dinner.</p>
<p>Here is <u><a href="http://bit.ly/3EiGyH">the link for it</a></u>.</p>
<p>Doug and I watched two parts of a four-and-a-half-part series done of a trip through northern Canada with Billy Connolly. It is just wonderful! We sat and laughed and oohed and ahhed over it, and I just wanted everyone I know to see it! Later tonight Doug made some copies, which I shall mail off tomorrow. </p>
<p>While he was busy with that, I called Don to wish him a "Happy Birthday" and got to speak to Tessa for a few minutes first. I told her how excited we all were that we are going to be seeing her and her dad on the 27th, and she too is excited about it. She is quite a family-oriented little girl and there are lots of us for her to get to know!</p>
<p>Don and I talked for an hour; I made tea and put my feet on the sofa and we discussed the  album and the photos he had never seen before, and before long were talking about cooking and recipes. I can't wait to visit Calgary so he can make his favourite spaghetti sauce for me with basil fried in garlic olive oil. Yum!  He and Gregg will have lot to talk about as they are both "foodies" and both of them do the daily cooking in the family ... and love doing it. We talked about old times, patches on clothes, and how well we did as kids despite not having much money to go 'round. </p>
<p>It's already bedtime here and I want to get at least a few more photos out of that ever-diminishing inbox. Tomorrow, though, I will concentrate on answering emails, as I heard from a few old friends over the past two days and I must keep up. </p>
<p>Blasts from the past for today ...  Don when he was five, Riku playing in his favourite "bag" cupboard here in 2003, Riku just up from a nap with his "crazy hair!" in 2004, Mirei feeding her daddy in 2006, Mirei serving tea in 2007, and Riku resting on a cannon after an outing with Doug on this day in 2008.</p>
