								<h2>A Morning Visit with Busy Finn</h2>
								<p>Susan likes to get her groceries on Monday mornings, and I like to have Finn here with me on those Mondays that it works out for both of us. Last week he went to the same nursery school/preschool group that Amelia went to, so we missed out on that day, but made up for it  another day with Mirei and some time at the BADM together as well. </p>
<p>Finn was a little disappointed to hear from his mom that Mirei wouldn't be here to play with, but finally made the decision to come and play on his own. He was all smiles when I opened the door, and he came in and got busy! He wanted to go upstairs first, so up we went, where he played with the race car set, the plastic blocks, the abacus, the little rocking horse decoration, and a stuffed dino toy. He moved so fast through all of these that it was almost impossible to get shots of him! We did sit on the bed and watch a Caillou video together while I fed him some oatmeal. He ate more than I thought he would as he had croup last week and is still suffering from a bad cold. Poor wee guy. He is really stuffed up! </p>
<p>Finn always loves to spend time in the garden, so off we went. He had brought his own little two-wheeler car which he scooted around on, pushing with his feet, but he quickly moved on to one of the plastic cars, swept and gathered up pine needles with me, rang the wind chimes with his broom, and used the toy rake to work in the garden beds themselves. </p>
<p>We were outside for close to an hour, and then it was time for more indoor toys. I'm not sure if I can remember all that he did over the next hour but I will try ... big truck, big basket, Tinker Toys, two different keyboards, snacks, toy kitchen time, small basket, stroller, push toy, and finally some time sitting at the table with Play-Doh. Finn likes most to poke sticks into the dough, and at one point he was very happy when I told him he made a tree! I managed to get that photo, as he was quite pleased with it. </p>
<p>Just fifteen minutes before Susan arrived Finn started to yawn and rub his eyes. He was ready for his nap for certain, and did very well despite being so sick. Susan came in bearing the most beautiful bouquet of flowers, a big lemon tart (one of my favourite desserts, but then Susan knows that), and the groceries she had kindly picked up for us at Trader Joe's. </p>
<p>Susan emailed later to tell me that Finn was asleep within minutes of leaving here, and slept until it was time to pick Amelia up from school at 2:40. </p>
<p>Doug is still feeling disoriented and slightly nauseous, but spent quite a bit of time on the computer doing some research into inner ear problems. It does seem that this is a matter of waiting to get over it, not an easy thing for anyone to do. </p>
<p>I did phone and managed to get him an appointment with his "primary care physician", someone he hasn't seen since we lost our health insurance in 2001. The good news is that that medical group accepts Medicare, and we are very happy that we don't have to go searching for new doctors.</p>
<p>Bryn had gone to the doctor today thinking he might have the dreaded H1N1 virus that is making the rounds, but luckily did not have the high fever associated with it. Phew! Kelly is still suffering with a very bad cough and not feeling any better after three weeks of it. She has missed more school than she ever dreamed she would, and misses her kindergartners. </p>
<p>Riku and Mirei had been looking forward to going to Universal Studios, dressed up in the Hallowe'en costumes Akane had ordered for them, but Bryn wasn't up to going to Osaka with them, so now they have some play costumes and they will find some other special event to attend at some point. </p>
<p>Bryn went down and set up Akane's computer with Skype so I could have a little chat with the children. I got to speak to both of them and Mirei gave Riku some time to chat on his own. They were busy watching something on TV so we didn't talk long, but long enough to make me happy. I'm now having doubts as to whether or not I will be able to go to Japan on Monday or even the Monday after that. I was so hoping to be there for Riku's birthday, but things happen and change the best laid plans, and this is one of those times. We shall continue to play this out day by day. </p>
