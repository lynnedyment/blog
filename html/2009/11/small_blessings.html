								<h2>Small Blessings</h2>
								<p>This did not start out to be my day. I woke at 4 A.M. and could not get back to sleep, no matter which way I turned or how many relaxation exercises I tried. I didn't want to disturb Doug by turning on even my tiny flashlight as he hadn't been feeling well at bedtime last night. </p>
<p>I gave up at 5:30, and came downstairs with two bed buddies in hand, intending to crawl into bed downstairs in the guest room with newly warmed "buddies". While I waited for them to heat, I checked my email and decided to write to a friend I hadn't written to for far too long. It always takes me a while when responding to an older email as there is lots of catching up to do. </p>
<p>At 6:30, after answering two more, I had almost convinced myself to just stay up. Common sense prevailed though, as I know that with just four hours sleep I would not get much accomplished anyway. So, I tucked in, read for perhaps five minutes and woke at 8:15. Yahoo! </p>
<p>For various reasons it was an emotional day for me. I talked to two of my sisters, took a very very long hot shower, and really pampered myself with lots of lotion and a lovely lavender rub on the back of my neck and earlobes and felt much much better. </p>
<p>I am having worrisome ... not pain, exactly, but a stretching feel on the left side of my abdomen, which is just huge right now and is just not flat lately, even in the mornings before I have had any wheat. If I stretch or pull to the side I can feel something is not quite right, and yet I cannot feel a lump or anything like the hernia I have thought it might be. So, that is niggling in the back of my mind as I am constantly aware of it. Until I can get a colonoscopy done I won't be feeling good about any of this.</p>
<p>I thought we might head out to do some shopping today, but instead was happy to just stay put. We did go out though to buy those Brussels sprouts we didn't have with our dinner last night, and I mailed the second part of UF's birthday gift to him, as well as a package for the children in Japan. </p>
<p>We came back to find two photos from Bryn waiting; they were all at a clinic to get the Swine flu shot for the children and the regular flu shot for the adults. The photos were of Riku and Mirei in a play area, and the second showed the well built house they had made together. </p>
<p>I was quite sure that Riku would be okay getting his shot, and he was, and I was equally sure that Mirei would not be, and she wasn't. I was very happy to be able to talk to her about it all via Skype soon after we got home. Mirei wanted to show me where she had her two needles... they must have had both shots... so she told me to "just wait right there!" and went off to pull off her first layer. I had seen part of her pretty undershirt and she was very happy to show it to me in full. Lovely. When I asked her if she cried, she said she screamed "but I was only fooling around." Right. We chatted a little bit and Riku popped his head around her shoulder to say hello too. We had to hang up too soon, as it was time for their lunch and Riku's tutor was there, but my heart lifted after that call; I got some sweet pics of them too, as well as some funny tongue shots from the two of them! Blessings for sure... </p>
<p>They had hoped to get one of the only shipment of Christmas trees today, sold at IKEA, but they had sold out already when Akane called. Now they have to look at what other options they have but  I'm sure they will come up with something. Wouldn't it be nice if IKEA realized that they could sell lots more and bring in more? They were only charging $20 per tree, although they were not sure what size they were.  </p>
<p>Doug and I had delicious leftovers tonight, but with the perfectly cooked Brussels sprouts we missed out on last night. Still to come... potato cakes with an egg for a late breakfast tomorrow, and hot turkey sandwiches for another day. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a taped "Gray's Anatomy" episode later on with a big plate of fresh fruit for dessert... half of the wonderful Honey Crisp apples we just recently discovered, a Mandarin orange each and lots of crisp crunchy red grapes. </p>
<p>I've been working on emails and photos since then, and talked to Sheldon later in the evening as well, a nice surprise call from him.  </p>
<p>No "now" photo from Susan's iPhone in two days. I wrote to her tonight telling her I missed them, and I had a newsy email back from her; busy two days for her, of course, with lots of plans, but we made tentative arrangements for the children to come over, perhaps on Sunday. </p>
<p>I've been listening to Susan Boyle's just-released DVD this evening and have so enjoyed it; "Wild Horses" is so beautifully sung. </p>
<p>Just before bedtime Bryn sent me a sweet photo of Mirei taking his drink "order"; she told him she didn't have any beer, but had "tea with apple juice'. A little later I received a photo of a "real princess"... a quick change of lifestyle for our used-to-be-waitress! </p>
<p>Bedtime. I won't be reading long tonight. </p>
