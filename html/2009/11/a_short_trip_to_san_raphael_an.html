								<h2>Good News in San Raphael, and  Riku's Birthday in Japan</h2>
								<p>Woke up this morning thinking of Riku being seven years old today, although he was still sound asleep at the time. Bryn told me last night that he had told Riku he was saying "good night" to a six year old but would be saying "good morning" to a seven year old. An exciting day for sure. This did confuse Mirei who wondered how he could turn seven when he was in bed; Bryn assumes she must think it happens when the candles get blown out. </p>
<p>Doug had his second follow-up appointment with another doctor today, this one at 1 P.M. in San Raphael. It was a beautiful clear day as we passed over the Golden Gate bridge, and it did feel a little strange not to be pulling off onto the Alexander Street exit to the Bay Area Discovery Museum with one of the children! </p>
<p>Doug's very young doctor ... a long lanky fellow, who is extremely well qualified and educated, and a long distance runner with many other interests to boot(!), told me I was welcome to tag along and watch as he put Doug through the paces for all the testing he requires. I was hoping to spend part of the time with my book, a cup of tea, and perhaps a sandwich at a nearby mall. I don't get out shopping often and I thought it would be fun to be in a mall filled with signs of Christmas. It wasn't! The music was too loud, the stores seemed to be filled with overcrowded shelves filled with inferior clothes or toys, and there wasn't anything at all that appealed to me to eat ... the choice was an Italian chain or a Chinese chain and the smells from them both weren't appealing at all. </p>
<p>So, I went back to the office and watched the last half hour of Doug's balance testing. At the end of it all, Doug received very good news. It is most certainly an inner ear problem and not neurological, and with some help from a good therapist, whom he recommended, he expects that Doug will be walking steadily within two months. Yahoo! So many fears laid to rest today, and Doug mentioned several times how relieved he was. Me too. </p>
<p>Of course I was so looking forward to "seeing" Riku and wishing him a very "Happy Birthday", but it was quite late by the time that happened. He had a busy day ... his piano lesson after school, then off on a bike ride with his dad to pick up the birthday cheesecake from a nearby bakery, and home for a quick chat with us before he, his dad, and Mark left for a sushi dinner celebration, meeting up with Akane and Mirei. </p>
<p>Riku grinned away as we sang to him, and we went off to bed as he went out to celebrate being seven in Japan! They were having cake and gift opening after dinner. </p>
<p>It was a little tough saying goodbye to him, but there it was a good day for him with another celebration (his official birthday party) coming up tomorrow.</p>
