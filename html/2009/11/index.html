								<h2><a href="/2009/11/dizzy_doug_and_chats.html">Dizzy Doug and Chats</a></h2>
								<p>Doug and I both slept surprisingly long and well, despite both of us dozing off several times yesterday for long periods of time. Whew! I slept in until 8:45 body time but, as we moved the clocks backward last night, it was 7:45 on the clock. </p>
<p>Doug is feeling much the same as he has been for two days, and after lots of reading on the Web today, it sounds as though this could go on for some time, from several days to several months, and even up to several years in severe cases. So, fingers crossed here for a speedy recovery! </p>
<p>Doug is unable to read easily, but spent a little more time on the computer today than yesterday, so I was lucky enough to get a few photos done for my blog entries, as well as family tree photos too. </p>
<p>I continue to add jobs to my to-do list as I think of them, but managed to cross a few off today too. I am very excited about the upcoming trip to Japan, now eight days away, but am also prepared to cancel it if Doug is not over his imbalance. He is not able to bend over comfortably, certainly could not get out to drive, or maneuver much around on his own, so we shall play this out day by day and see what happens. Doug did lots of reading on the various things it could be, and even found a forty-five minute "exercise" that might get rid of any tiny crystal build-up that might be the culprit too. </p>
<p>I spoke with Susan, Amelia, and Finn today. They all had a good time last night, and Amelia told me she had collected a half basket of candy in her Hallowe'en pumpkin. Finn was still feeling sick and even though he claimed he wanted to talk in actual fact he just was not up to it. Poor wee guy. I may see him in the morning for a few hours, depending on how he is feeling then. </p>
<p>Bryn and I had a chat on IM and it was good to catch up a bit. Riku's piano teacher told Akane that she envies Riku his lovely singing voice. It was good to hear that, as Riku loves to sing, and there are lots of opportunities to do so at school. </p>
<p>Here is another bit of conversation between us.. said Bryn: "He was complaining about the piano stuff in his class ... "<strong>Too easy!</strong>" He says that he wants a challenge, like "this" (pointing to his music sheets)". I know how he loves to play the piano, although isn't always keen to practice, so it was good to hear that he feels this way. </p>
<p>Bryn went for his second run this morning at 5:30 along the river and said he enjoyed it very much, except for the running. It was a humid clear day there today and warmed up nicely during the day. </p>
<p>Riku wanted to talk to his Grandpa this morning, before going off to school, so they arranged a Skype chat just after Riku finished up his hot cereal. We both had a nice chat with him.Doug had the headphones on, but I put my ear next to Doug's so I could hear Riku, and see him too. (I'm like Mirei and can't resist seeing and talking to him too!)  How I miss seeing that little face! I am still getting used to him having his top two adult teeth in. How that changed him. </p>
<p>He had some questions for Doug about his hospital stays and they talked about needles and what else they did to him. He laughed when Doug told him about having to have bits of his "fur" shaved from his chest before they did one of the tests, an EKG. </p>
<p>Riku told me that he liked the Hallowe'en book I sent along with Bryn, and that he was going to Universal Studios tomorrow for the big Hallowe'en event there. He will be one of the UltraMan characters and Mirei a female cartoon figure I have forgotten the name of ... "Peach" or something. </p>
<p>Riku had asked me if I were coming to Japan soon. When I told him perhaps not because I couldn't leave Grandpa alone, he said "Maybe you should get a Grandpa-sitter."! How we laughed! </p>
<p>I am hoping to be there for his birthday on November the 13th, and Bryn called out that they would just have Riku turn seven when I did get there finally. That made Riku laugh. He wisely suggested that Doug use a cane, so Doug went off and got one he owns, and it does make walking easier for him. What a good suggestion! </p>
<p>Mirei was anxious to chat with us too, but we promised we could talk to her after Riku left for school. Later on in the day, we had that chat, and she was her usual bubbly self. They had all been to see a skin specialist, and Mirei told me she now had cream for behind her knee, for her bumps. </p>
<p>I took a snapshot of her too (blurry, but still so good to have), and we said goodbye, but she told me first that she missed me. I miss her too, very much, and do hope I see them both soon. </p>
<p>One of the things I crossed off my list today was the twenty Christmas cards I promised myself to write. They're done! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/a_morning_visit_with_finn.html">A Morning Visit with Busy Finn</a></h2>
								<p>Susan likes to get her groceries on Monday mornings, and I like to have Finn here with me on those Mondays that it works out for both of us. Last week he went to the same nursery school/preschool group that Amelia went to, so we missed out on that day, but made up for it  another day with Mirei and some time at the BADM together as well. </p>
<p>Finn was a little disappointed to hear from his mom that Mirei wouldn't be here to play with, but finally made the decision to come and play on his own. He was all smiles when I opened the door, and he came in and got busy! He wanted to go upstairs first, so up we went, where he played with the race car set, the plastic blocks, the abacus, the little rocking horse decoration, and a stuffed dino toy. He moved so fast through all of these that it was almost impossible to get shots of him! We did sit on the bed and watch a Caillou video together while I fed him some oatmeal. He ate more than I thought he would as he had croup last week and is still suffering from a bad cold. Poor wee guy. He is really stuffed up! </p>
<p>Finn always loves to spend time in the garden, so off we went. He had brought his own little two-wheeler car which he scooted around on, pushing with his feet, but he quickly moved on to one of the plastic cars, swept and gathered up pine needles with me, rang the wind chimes with his broom, and used the toy rake to work in the garden beds themselves. </p>
<p>We were outside for close to an hour, and then it was time for more indoor toys. I'm not sure if I can remember all that he did over the next hour but I will try ... big truck, big basket, Tinker Toys, two different keyboards, snacks, toy kitchen time, small basket, stroller, push toy, and finally some time sitting at the table with Play-Doh. Finn likes most to poke sticks into the dough, and at one point he was very happy when I told him he made a tree! I managed to get that photo, as he was quite pleased with it. </p>
<p>Just fifteen minutes before Susan arrived Finn started to yawn and rub his eyes. He was ready for his nap for certain, and did very well despite being so sick. Susan came in bearing the most beautiful bouquet of flowers, a big lemon tart (one of my favourite desserts, but then Susan knows that), and the groceries she had kindly picked up for us at Trader Joe's. </p>
<p>Susan emailed later to tell me that Finn was asleep within minutes of leaving here, and slept until it was time to pick Amelia up from school at 2:40. </p>
<p>Doug is still feeling disoriented and slightly nauseous, but spent quite a bit of time on the computer doing some research into inner ear problems. It does seem that this is a matter of waiting to get over it, not an easy thing for anyone to do. </p>
<p>I did phone and managed to get him an appointment with his "primary care physician", someone he hasn't seen since we lost our health insurance in 2001. The good news is that that medical group accepts Medicare, and we are very happy that we don't have to go searching for new doctors.</p>
<p>Bryn had gone to the doctor today thinking he might have the dreaded H1N1 virus that is making the rounds, but luckily did not have the high fever associated with it. Phew! Kelly is still suffering with a very bad cough and not feeling any better after three weeks of it. She has missed more school than she ever dreamed she would, and misses her kindergartners. </p>
<p>Riku and Mirei had been looking forward to going to Universal Studios, dressed up in the Hallowe'en costumes Akane had ordered for them, but Bryn wasn't up to going to Osaka with them, so now they have some play costumes and they will find some other special event to attend at some point. </p>
<p>Bryn went down and set up Akane's computer with Skype so I could have a little chat with the children. I got to speak to both of them and Mirei gave Riku some time to chat on his own. They were busy watching something on TV so we didn't talk long, but long enough to make me happy. I'm now having doubts as to whether or not I will be able to go to Japan on Monday or even the Monday after that. I was so hoping to be there for Riku's birthday, but things happen and change the best laid plans, and this is one of those times. We shall continue to play this out day by day. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/tuesday_at_home_1.html">Tuesday at Home</a></h2>
								<p>When I checked my email first thing this A.M., there was a message from Liz, suggesting a morning chat, to catch up on our lives since September. I had already showered, and so sat with a big mug of hot water, and enjoyed our one-hour phone visit. There was talk about the swine flu that is sweeping both countries, and what was going on with Doug, and whether or not I would make it to Japan next week or not. That seems to be less likely now, or at least leaving by Monday is, as I can't imagine at this stage that Doug is going to get better that quickly. </p>
<p>I also talked to Kelly today, who is still very sick with a bad cough. She has missed so many days of teaching and is feeling awful about not being with her students, but at least she is happy with the substitute teacher who is taking her place. Kelly is hoping to go to a first aid course on Friday, but she honestly sounds like she needs some first aid herself! I learned one piece of good news though: Kelly is going to be able to stay with her class until the end of the school year. Yay! There was some question as to whether another full-time teacher would be taking over in early December, but this has been resolved in Kelly's favour. I am so very happy for her Jr. K, and kindergarten students, as she is a kind and caringteacher, just perfect for their first year at school. </p>
<p>Gail and I worked, for the first time in far too long, on our family tree for an hour in the late afternoon. She walked me through a mistake I had in my tree, and I filled her in on some information on a family with whom I connected on Facebook. We still have to look into it further, and there's not much time available for it, but it just feels good to be back at the tree, if only for an hour. </p>
<p>I wrote a few more Christmas cards, did some clearing away, ordered some gifts online with Doug putting in the actual orders for me, and felt as though I got lots done. However, at day's end it never feels as though I accomplished as much as I had hoped to. </p>
<p>I am feeling a little sad, knowing there is a good chance that I won't be with Riku on his birthday. However, I am not giving up quite yet, and won't cancel my ticket until it really looks as though there is no hope of leaving on Monday. </p>
<p>Doug and I cleared away another tape, although Doug mostly closes his eyes and listens to them, as he is still seeing double. For me, it feels as though watching these old tapes is also clearing things up, and gives me a chance to just sit and put my feet up too. My back thanks me on days like this. </p>
<p>We have to be up early tomorrow, at 6:30, to be ready to leave for Doug's doctor appointment at 7:30, so I am heading up to bed earlier than usual.</p>
<p>I'm so enjoying the beautiful flowers from Susan; I spent a lot of time in this kitchen area and all those gorgeous colours constantly catch my eye. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/two_flu_shots_today.html">Two Flu Shots, and a Skype Chat with Riku</a></h2>
								<p>Doug and I were out the door at 7:30 this morning and pleased to find the parking at the new offices for the doctor much easier than we expected it to be. Doug saw a nurse-practitioner for this visit, as the ER doctors wanted him to have a baseline visit, so he could be followed from this point on. His blood pressure is up but he knows he is worried about how long this inner ear problem is going to last, and of course there is no way to find out. He does have an appointment with an ear/nose/throat specialist next Monday, though, and perhaps he might have some insight into what is going on. </p>
<p>We stopped in at Rainbow Groceries, the first time we have been out and wandering around since last Friday, and we stopped in at the post office too, buying stamps for the Christmas cards I have been writing, a few at a time throughout the day. </p>
<p>Since I hope to be back working as a doula at SFGH before too long, I have to have both flu shots. They have a clinic set up three days a week and so this afternoon I went off to get them. I thought it would just be the H1N1 but they had both that and the seasonal shot available, and I was happy to get them over with at the same time. It was a gorgeous warm day again and it was nice to be out for a little walk in the sun. </p>
<p>I got lots of little jobs done in the house today, cleared away lots of emails, sat and went through a few magazines (I have stacks of them!), and Doug sat and signed Christmas cards with me. I had been doing them on my own, as he hasn't felt up to any close work, so I think this is a good sign of some small improvement. </p>
<p>Bryn and I were chatting on IM this evening; they are all off to Sakai tomorrow after Mirei's first piano lesson (!) (I can't wait to hear how this goes), Mirei is back in school and enjoying it, and is also enjoying spending time with Mark. Bryn is happy to have Mark there, getting to spend some time with him and getting to know the children better too. </p>
<p>I got to talk to Riku after he got home from school. How I love seeing Riku's big smile! He told me how he had rescued a caterpillar recently; the other day it was a big slug that he moved off the road, and I told him about Auntie Candy and Uncle Rick rescuing a cat, who was walking across a busy road with a potato chip bag over its head! Riku also showed me the birthday card that Auntie Gail and Uncle Tom sent to him and read it to me as well. I snapped lots of photos of him, including one of him reading that card to me, and now have the hard task of deciding which ones to keep. They are all on Doug's computer and I am sure I won't be able to keep them all! How lucky I am to be living in this time; I often think of how different my Nana Lee's life in Liverpool would have been, all those years ago, when her grandchildren were so young, and living so far away.  </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/midweek.html">Mid-Week</a></h2>
								<p>Another warm sunny day today, and I appreciated it even more after IM-ing with Doug's sister, Sandy, this evening, and hearing how she and Corey stood for an hour in the cold this morning in Hamilton waiting to see Prince Charles and Camilla. When they did arrive, it was raining icy pellets on them all! Brr-r-r! She did take some amazing close-up shots of the Royal Couple; her grandchildren may be very impressed one day at how close their grandmother got to them. I was, and she took great photos too, as always. </p>
<p>We spent the day at home today, and I was busy clearing out lots of paper, making good use of the electric shredder I don't use nearly often enough. If and when we do move, I would like to have all the excess files and folders empty of all but the essentials. Not a very exciting day, but productive for certain. </p>
<p>Kelly is still home, feeling worse than ever, since she is now coughing up nasty stuff from her lungs. </p>
<p>Doug and I are certainly having quieter days together than we have in a long long time. The days disappear quickly, though, despite not having such a busy household.</p>
<p>A lovely photo arrived today from Bryn ... a darling picture of Riku and Mirei dressed in traditional Japanese kimono, for a "coming of age" ceremony. I am not sure when this took place, or where, or what it signifies, but it is one of the cutest photos we have seen of them! I do hope to get more information from Bryn about it, although there doesn't seem to be as much free chat time lately. One day though I will add it in here.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/the_week_is_flying_by.html">The Week Flew By!</a></h2>
								<p>Unlike the past few days, the weather today was overcast from the time we woke, until we went to bed. There were periods of rain, too, and the tiniest ray of sunshine burst through at one point. I walked to the mailbox in a light drizzle and enjoyed the fine mist there and back. It was mild too, much more so than I thought it would be, as the house stayed cool all day. </p>
<p>I went into the family tree today to enter some new information from Doug's cousin, Bob, who has been filling me in on some family members. Now that I know I'm not going to Japan on Monday after all, I slacked off and enjoyed this time working on the Ancestry tree. I went for months without having more than an hour here and there, and so it was fun to be working away at it again. </p>
<p>Bryn and family and Mark were on their way to Sakai tonight, right after Mirei's first piano lesson. I can't wait to hear how it went, but I did get a photo from Bryn of Riku at his lesson. I like his teacher so much, and think this photo shows just how compatible these two are ... I thought they were a perfect fit when I saw them together in May. Riku is looking very grown-up to us lately! </p>
<p>I had a very long chat with Uncle Frank tonight; I sat down to write him and decided I would much rather hear his voice. I made myself a cup of tea, and sat on the sofa hearing all his latest news. He has a new male therapist and is happy to be back working at his exercises again. He filled me in on a few people I got to know when I was there in September, and I told him that I had a nice letter in from Neal today. Neal drops in to see him almost weekly, and UF got to meet Nea's aide, a young woman named Laura, who is newly graduated and still full of optimism and good spirits. UF enjoyed her company as much as Neal did. </p>
<p>Doug and I went up to watch a recorded show; I'm getting close to my stockpile of old Oprah's and am enjoying watching them with Doug in the evenings, just for a break together. </p>
<p>It's cold enough at night now that I am happy to head up with two of my "bed buddies"; how I love having my cold feet all warmed up within seconds. Doug pointed out a cartoon this morning in the paper that he felt was drawn just for me ... it showed a group of folks in hell, in a fiery inferno, and one gal off to the right, wrapped in a sweater saying "Don't you find it a bit chilly here?" Yup, that's me! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/a_long_saturday.html">Whipping Through Those Emails!</a></h2>
								<p>This was a very productive day for me. I had nothing planned for the entire day but to get as many emails answered as I could, touching base with so many friends I have neglected for so long. I wrote emails to Kei in Japan, Judith in Vancouver, Gary Peters in Hamilton, Sheila (one of my doula moms), Tay (now living in Idaho), and Liz in Toronto, as well as many, many others. Seeing those numbers go down just felt so good, and I look forward to hearing back from them all soon. I'm now beginning to see their is a light at the end of the inbox tunnel! I just have to keep writing! </p>
<p>I wrote to Bryn and asked him to cancel my Monday flight, feeling so sad that I won't be seeing Riku turn seven, but also knowing it will be good not to have to wait nine months between visits with him. This would have been the case if I had seen him in December, as I don't expect him here until next August. Mirei and Bryn plan to be here in the spring. </p>
<p>Doug and I ate our dinner upstairs watching a movie, a favourite treat for us ... feels quite decadent, I must say! </p>
<p>I have pulled some photos from years past, since I don't have any from today to post. Enjoy these pics of Riku on this same date in 2004, Amelia in 2005, Amelia and Riku at the playground in 2006, Finn in 2007, and a beautiful tree in full autumn foliage in Niagara Falls in 2008. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/a_chatty_day.html">A  Chatty Sunday</a></h2>
								<p>Today felt like Monday to me for some reason, so much so, that despite knowing it wasn't, I felt compelled to do the laundry, as I always do on Monday! Yesterday I was convinced it was Friday, and so the last few days have felt out of sync' for me. </p>
<p>I plowed through so many emails today, which felt just grand! I must have had over fifty sets of photos chosen as pics for my blog entries, backed up from over a year ago, and so slowly but surely over the past week, Doug has kindly been turning them into "blog-size" for me. It has been fun, actually, since I got to re-read blogs from last December, and see all the photos I took of those days before and after Christmas. I am very pleased to have gone from a high of over 650 emails and attachments to just 160 tonight! A large number of Ancestry hints, from my family tree work, have been transferred to another folder, but at least now I know I am dealing only with photos and emails that need answering and/or filing. </p>
<p>I got in a couple of the Ancestry hints that come in now and then, and spent a happy hour adding more sources to people already in my tree. It's good to be back at it, although I must keep at the Christmas cards too, as I didn't write even one today. </p>
<p>It was quite the day for connecting with people, and Caillie started it off with a call from her Dad's this morning. She calls quite frequently and I was happy to sit on the sofa with a cup of tea, feet up, and catch up on Hallowe'en, how she was feeling — she was running a high fever and coughing last week — and of course how messy her room was. The answer? "Oh my gosh, only six weeks until you get here?"! </p>
<p>I have been missing Skype calls with Garry in Sweden, which means I haven't seen as much of his darling one-and-a-half-year-old Freija. Today I was home, and didn't have a busy child with me, and so Freija and I showed each other our Raggedy Ann dolls and I got to say hi to her. She is lovely. I sat and watched videos of her last night, and what a character she is! She climbs, and dances, and admires her belly button, and walks ever so nicely with her Grandpa in Lion's Bay. I love to hear her mom laughing away in the background of the video. </p>
<p>Much to my surprise, Garry has a full beard! He looks so very different, and reminded me a lot of my nephew Michael. Garry looks great with a beard, and he chuckled when I told him how much I like it. Apparently so do most of the Swedes he knows, including Line, and they don't want him to shave it. However, they are all off to Thailand for three weeks and he wants it gone before that holiday. I managed to get a shot of Garry, even though it is quite dark, but Freija was tired, and I didn't get a photo of her this time. Coming up, though, at some point, for certain. </p>
<p>I phoned to talk to Amelia about her new loose tooth, and she was still very excited about it. It has been too long since Amelia has been over here on her own, and I was hoping she might be able to come and make cookies with me after school one day this week, or watch a movie with me here at home, or go to a playground ... her choice. She opted for baking together; we used to do this and both enjoyed it so much. I forget the exact phrase she used, but when I asked which day would work, she said something like "I have very busy days", but with Susan we decided that tomorrow would work out just fine. Great! It's a date! I think we will make chocolate chip, although I will let Amelia decide between those and oatmeal/raisin. </p>
<p>Doug and I had gone out to the bank, and to the grocery store, and picked up two "California Kitchen" margherita pizzas on sale for just $4.00 each. That seemed the perfect choice for dinner, and so it was, with added fresh tomato and some fresh Buffalo mozzarella cheese on both sides and sauteed spinach added to mine. We both enjoyed them so much, and the price was right, so we'll be having these once a week from now on. </p>
<p>We took our fruit upstairs to enjoy while watching a one-and-a-half-hour British detective show, from a series we have enjoyed in the past. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/earnosethroat_doc_and_skype_ch.html">Ear/Nose/Throat Doc', and Skype Chats</a></h2>
								<p>Doug had an appointment with the specialist this morning at 10 A.M. We were hoping perhaps to confirm that Doug did indeed have an inner ear problem, but perhaps with an idea of which of the three types it might be. The visit lasted almost an hour and a half, and Doug was thoroughly examined; not just his ears but with a tube up behind his sinuses, and with a series of tests to check out hearing, etc. At the end of the appointment, Doug was told that perhaps it was not an inner ear problem but neurological after all. The next step is a visit to a clinic where they will submit Doug to a series of tests that have his eye movements being measured while they spin him and shake him 'round a bit. Despite a waiting list, Doug has been lucky enough to get an appointment in just three days in San Raphael, for which he is very grateful because the waiting is not something he wants more of. </p>
<p>My friend Judith called this morning before we left, and since it has been months since we have been in touch, we decided to finish up later on. Doug and I had a few errands to run after the appointment too. He can get around with his cane, as long as we are not moving too quickly and I'm sure being out is a good change for him too. </p>
<p>It was after 1 o'clock by the time we got home, and I called Susan to confirm that Amelia is out of school at 2:40 for pick-up, However, they had made other plans for a playdate with an old classmate it is hard to arrange after-school time with. This worked out at my end, since I had left home without eating, so I sat and read the paper, with a big brunch to see me through to dinner.</p>
<p>Bryn called through on Skype to see if I would like to chat with Riku before he left for school, and I was just delighted to see his face, snap a couple of photos of him, and hear all his news. He had a new Ultraman video that he was anxious to show me, explaining how to tell the good guys from the bad; one has blue eyes, and the other black. He enjoyed playing with the Wii at his aunt's and uncle's house, but much to his chagrin did not get to rush in on Friday night, wash his hands and play immediately. He had to wait until the next morning. Riku had just finished his fruit bowl, and was still in his PJs, looking rumpled and early morning sweet. </p>
<p>He had overheard me telling Bryn about Doug's tests, and wanted to hear about them himself. He mentioned my not being able to be there for his birthday and asked if I could be there for Christmas. Of course now I will not be going to Japan unless Doug is miraculously healed within a week, but Bryn seems fine with my going in the New Year too, when the excitement of the birthdays, Christmas, and New Year is over. </p>
<p>Mirei was still asleep when I was first talking to Riku, but she joined in with her PJs too, also looking early morning rumpled and slowly coming 'round. We got lots of smiles and she so kindly said that she would come to San Francisco with some cream, put it on Grandpa and rub him so he feels better. And she has plans to draw us a picture and give me a present of Cinderella with pretty pretty dresses, but who is "cool" too, and pretty. </p>
<p>I have been very curious about Mirei's first piano class on Friday, and she told me that she went to the teacher's house and she liked it, but that was all I heard. It will be such fun to hear her play soon! I know she was looking forward to having to practice. </p>
<p>Judy and I had another hour to chat after the children and I said goodbye; they both had to get ready for school. I called Kelly to see how she was doing: she went back to school today after missing most of the past three weeks, and was exhausted when she got home. She is going to try to go again tomorrow and perhaps take Wednesday off. She's still waiting for her appointment with a respirologist. </p>
<p>Good news! Don and Tessa are going to be in Niagara Falls on the 27th of December, so the crew from Toronto, and Doug and I too, will be there for sure! It has been almost a year and a half since we last saw them. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a British detective show, part of a series we enjoy. Doug is doing a little better at seeing it more clearly, although it is more likely that his brain is adjusting to do so. Sub-titled films are out of the question at the moment, but it's good to be back to relaxing for an hour upstairs together in the evenings. </p>
<p>The photos taken while I am on Skype are not high resolution pics but I am so grateful to have these images! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/an_early_morning_call.html">An Early Morning Call... and Some Blasts From the Past</a></h2>
								<p>The phone rang at 8 A.M. today, one of the very rare days when I was still sleeping at that hour. I had awakened at 2 o'clock and had trouble getting back to sleep, no doubt due to the lists I was making in my head! It was Don, my "baby" brother. We're in touch often through emails, exchanging family news and photos, but it was wonderful to hear his voice. </p>
<p>Don and Tessa are coming to Niagara Falls on the 27th of December, and we are all very excited about this. Doug and Don haven't seen each other for well over twelve years, we think, and Kelly will be introducing him to Gregg for the first time. Don hasn't seen any of his nieces and nephews in the Falls for many years, and many of them have never met Tessa, now eleven years old. All eight siblings were together at a family wedding in 2008, but that is a long time to be away from a sibling. Sadly Gail won't be with us this year; often she and Don are the only two missing from our Boxing Day event. This will still be held, I believe, as we gather with friends there too, but we are also all looking forward to being at Beth's and Paul's on the 27th for this unexpected family reunion. Yahoo! </p>
<p>Days continue to be quiet and productive. I have been working hard at reducing the number of emails in my in-box. I can remember years ago when I felt that having ten to answer was a backlog, and a few months ago I had over 650 messages waiting to be answered/read/tossed and/or filed. </p>
<p>Belonging to Ancestry these past few years is part of the reason for the backlog, as I frequently get emails either from individuals or from Ancestry itself, suggesting connections in my family tree. Moving those to a separate folder at least separated the personal from the tree-related. </p>
<p>Another part of the backlog were photos that Doug creates for my blog entries. When life got very busy last year I often put the photos into the almost daily spots, but did not move the photos out. But there were also many times when they just weren't put in the written blog spots, so after tackling that huge job over these past few months, I am now down to a grand total of 125 entries! I will be very pleased when I am back to that "backlog" of ten again! </p>
<p>Doug is feeling much the same as he did almost two weeks ago. He felt a little more off balance in the morning, although that improved slightly during the day. I know he's looking forward to having the test tomorrow over and done with, if only to perhaps get another opinion as to what is going on with him. </p>
<p>We had a typically quiet evening, watching the last in a series of three British detective shows, I went through more emails, getting blog photos off my desktop and into folders, and we both went off to bed at 11 P.M. </p>
<p>I do hate to see a photo-less blog entry and so here is a set of photos from November the 10th in years gone by. </p>
<p>We have Riku, in 2003, just three days before he turned a year old, up to no good at all in my kitchen! </p>
<p>This day in 2004 found me taking Amelia for a walk in her stroller in Golden Gate Park, and then some time at her home with her too. </p>
<p>Riku loved doing puzzles in 2005, when he was just about to turn three. Hard puzzles too, but he could do them on his own, just as his dad could at that age. I took photos of the beginning and almost at the end of the puzzle session this day. </p>
<p>And three years ago today, in 2006, we went to the Oakland Zoo with Riku and Amelia.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/happy_birthday_don_and_blasts.html">Happy Birthday, Don ... and Blasts from the Past!</a></h2>
								<p>It's Remembrance Day, and as well as the significance of it as a tribute to men and women who died while serving in the  Armed Services, it was also a day my mom said she would remember for sure, as she gave birth to her last child, Don (he turned 56 today).</p>
<p> I was working on photos this morning, adding more to some of my older posts whenever I noticed there was room for one or two more. Of course this meant I was looking into older photo files, and I thought how much fun it would be if, on days that I didn't have pictures to add to my daily entries, I posted photos from the same day from years gone by.</p>
<p>As I pulled photos for today ...  11/11, I thought it would be fun to make up an online album for Don. We always had such big fun birthday celebrations when we were kids. With ten children in the house, every birthday was an instant party! We didn't have much money, but no one ever had a party without streamers, and balloons, and pop (we are Canadians!), served in paper cups, which made it seem really special. Don is in Calgary with no siblings there to celebrate with him, so I was sure some memories of him with all of us might be a nice surprise for him. </p>
<p>I went through stacks of photos and pulled out a few years' worth, scanned them, and then was grateful for Doug's help in cropping, lightening or darkening them (why did people take photos with the sun in front of them?!), and putting them into a Kodak album for me. It was a fun project as each photo brought back lots of memories for me too! I sent it off and went to prepare dinner.</p>
<p>Here is <u><a href="http://bit.ly/3EiGyH">the link for it</a></u>.</p>
<p>Doug and I watched two parts of a four-and-a-half-part series done of a trip through northern Canada with Billy Connolly. It is just wonderful! We sat and laughed and oohed and ahhed over it, and I just wanted everyone I know to see it! Later tonight Doug made some copies, which I shall mail off tomorrow. </p>
<p>While he was busy with that, I called Don to wish him a "Happy Birthday" and got to speak to Tessa for a few minutes first. I told her how excited we all were that we are going to be seeing her and her dad on the 27th, and she too is excited about it. She is quite a family-oriented little girl and there are lots of us for her to get to know!</p>
<p>Don and I talked for an hour; I made tea and put my feet on the sofa and we discussed the  album and the photos he had never seen before, and before long were talking about cooking and recipes. I can't wait to visit Calgary so he can make his favourite spaghetti sauce for me with basil fried in garlic olive oil. Yum!  He and Gregg will have lot to talk about as they are both "foodies" and both of them do the daily cooking in the family ... and love doing it. We talked about old times, patches on clothes, and how well we did as kids despite not having much money to go 'round. </p>
<p>It's already bedtime here and I want to get at least a few more photos out of that ever-diminishing inbox. Tomorrow, though, I will concentrate on answering emails, as I heard from a few old friends over the past two days and I must keep up. </p>
<p>Blasts from the past for today ...  Don when he was five, Riku playing in his favourite "bag" cupboard here in 2003, Riku just up from a nap with his "crazy hair!" in 2004, Mirei feeding her daddy in 2006, Mirei serving tea in 2007, and Riku resting on a cannon after an outing with Doug on this day in 2008.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/a_short_trip_to_san_raphael_an.html">Good News in San Raphael, and  Riku's Birthday in Japan</a></h2>
								<p>Woke up this morning thinking of Riku being seven years old today, although he was still sound asleep at the time. Bryn told me last night that he had told Riku he was saying "good night" to a six year old but would be saying "good morning" to a seven year old. An exciting day for sure. This did confuse Mirei who wondered how he could turn seven when he was in bed; Bryn assumes she must think it happens when the candles get blown out. </p>
<p>Doug had his second follow-up appointment with another doctor today, this one at 1 P.M. in San Raphael. It was a beautiful clear day as we passed over the Golden Gate bridge, and it did feel a little strange not to be pulling off onto the Alexander Street exit to the Bay Area Discovery Museum with one of the children! </p>
<p>Doug's very young doctor ... a long lanky fellow, who is extremely well qualified and educated, and a long distance runner with many other interests to boot(!), told me I was welcome to tag along and watch as he put Doug through the paces for all the testing he requires. I was hoping to spend part of the time with my book, a cup of tea, and perhaps a sandwich at a nearby mall. I don't get out shopping often and I thought it would be fun to be in a mall filled with signs of Christmas. It wasn't! The music was too loud, the stores seemed to be filled with overcrowded shelves filled with inferior clothes or toys, and there wasn't anything at all that appealed to me to eat ... the choice was an Italian chain or a Chinese chain and the smells from them both weren't appealing at all. </p>
<p>So, I went back to the office and watched the last half hour of Doug's balance testing. At the end of it all, Doug received very good news. It is most certainly an inner ear problem and not neurological, and with some help from a good therapist, whom he recommended, he expects that Doug will be walking steadily within two months. Yahoo! So many fears laid to rest today, and Doug mentioned several times how relieved he was. Me too. </p>
<p>Of course I was so looking forward to "seeing" Riku and wishing him a very "Happy Birthday", but it was quite late by the time that happened. He had a busy day ... his piano lesson after school, then off on a bike ride with his dad to pick up the birthday cheesecake from a nearby bakery, and home for a quick chat with us before he, his dad, and Mark left for a sushi dinner celebration, meeting up with Akane and Mirei. </p>
<p>Riku grinned away as we sang to him, and we went off to bed as he went out to celebrate being seven in Japan! They were having cake and gift opening after dinner. </p>
<p>It was a little tough saying goodbye to him, but there it was a good day for him with another celebration (his official birthday party) coming up tomorrow.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/happy_birthday_riku.html">Happy 7th Birthday Riku!</a></h2>
								<p>If Riku were in San Francisco for his birthday, today is the day we would be having his family celebration. It's Friday here, but in not too many hours Riku will be having a party in Japan with his Mom, Dad, sister, Xiao (his Chinese tutor), Sugimoto (a boy from his grade one class), and best friend Juka (a little girl with whom he often walks home from school, and who came to the party with her mom and little sister). </p>
<p>I knew it would be a busy day today, so we were lucky to talk to Riku and Mirei in the morning. Riku had been tidying his room in anticipation of having guests there, although he is very neat and likes things in their place, so I don't imagine there was too much to do up there! Both Doug and I spoke with him for quite a long time, and he even opened a couple of gifts while we were on Skype ... his new skateboard(!) — he had guessed what it was from the wrapping, but was still thrilled to bits with it — and one of the books we gave him. </p>
<p>Mirei let him have lots of talking time before edging her way in to tell us about her day! I even got to read two stories to her, while Riku examined more of his gifts, although he sidled over to listen in too. Akane and Bryn were doing some prep' work for the party that would start at 1 P.M.. </p>
<p>Not long after our chat, I went off to meet Susan, Kevin, Amelia, Finn, and Amelia's friend Sheena at Goat Hill Pizza on Potrero Hill. We shared a big salad, and two pizzas, Finn played with a car, and Amelia and Sheena drew and chatted with some folks at the next table after dinner. It was fun, the pizza was delicious and it was casual and an early night too. I was home by 6 P.M. with some pizza slices for Doug. We went up to watch a British show and turned in early. </p>
<p>I went to sleep wondering what Riku would be wishing for when he blew out those seven candles! </p>

								<p>Doug had decided to go to a double feature at the Balboa Theatre today, and so he did lots of photo work for me in the morning. </p>
<p>I planned to stay home and whip through more emails, work on older blog entries that don't have photos in them, and read through some more magazines. I am making great headway in all of these areas, but decided to clean the laundry room first, and get all of the activity books and games back in place after Mirei's visit. </p>
<p>To my surprise, Doug came walking back in about twenty minutes after he left. He had just missed the bus, and we decided that was best anyway as we had some errands we wanted to run in the car. </p>
<p>That was our day... some time in the house and a little time outside, after a rainy beginning to the day. The sun came out later in the afternoon and I did a little sweepingand  tidying up in the back yard just to take advantage of what turned into a gorgeous California November day. </p>
<p>No photos for today, so I shall add in just one of the many beautiful shots of roses I have taken in Golden Gate park over the years. </p>

								<p>Many years ago, when visitors came to San Francisco, one of our favourite brunch spots was "The Crepevine" in the Haight. They made the most delicious "scrambles", a basic fried potato dish with a huge blackboard-full of suggested additions. They all had clever California/San Francisco names, none of which I can remember right now, but one of my favourites had tofu and avocado in it. It was always hard to choose, though, as there were so many options, all sounding delicious, but there was almost always a lineup, so that gave me time to make that final decision. </p>
<p>It was cold in the house when we awoke, with the heat down to 62ºF, and on days like that what I like best is a big breakfast with lots of hot tea. Doug came downstairs a little later today and I suggested that I make a scramble. I had cooked up extra potatoes last night, as there is always a way to use them up for a meal at any time of the day or night. </p>
<p>I fried up the coarsely cut potatoes with green onion and a crushed garlic clove and then added ... small cubes of a tasty hickory-baked tofu that Doug had picked up the other day, a fresh tomato (well drained), grated old cheddar cheese, a really big handful of chopped spinach, and three well-beaten eggs. Stirred it all up until the eggs were just cooked, added salt and pepper and voila ... my homemade version of a "Crepevine" scramble, along with two slices of the vegetarian "bacon" we like so much. We both thoroughly enjoyed every bite of it! </p>
<p>Doug went off to a double feature today, taking the bus, picking up a vegetarian Vietnamese sandwich on the way for his lunch. I stayed home to work on emails and photos: did a little of both, but ended up spending most of the day reading a "thriller" that Doug had recommended to me. It was a page turner for sure, and I was halfway through its over 400 pages when he arrived home.</p>
<p>Lovely day, it was! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/amelias_visit.html">Amelia's Visit</a></h2>
								<p>It has been too long since Amelia was here with me at home on her own, and we had a lovely two-and-a-half hours together. We picked her up after school at 2:40; Susan had forgotten to tell her that I would be picking her up, but she spotted me through the class window and I got a very big smile, while she held up the sweet paper bag turkey she had made. </p>
<p>I thought perhaps that Amelia might like to bake cookies, something we used to do quite often together on a Saturday morning, but the last time she was here she decided to do other things. This happened again today, as I gave her a choice of things to do, after we had shared some snacks.</p>
<p>She decided that first she wanted to do some of her old favourite activities on the computer. I pulled up the long list of possibilities and Amelia pretty well went at it on her own from there. She did the matching game, watched the falling-girl-on-the-balloons fall over and over, squashed bugs, and even did a turn on the Baby Type sounds that she liked so much when she was little. </p>
<p>Her next choice was to play doctor, actually vet, as she pulled out lots of animals and we sat on the bed, talking as animals, and treating them. Monkey had brambles pulled from his arm, the dog had a bandage removed, a squirrel got a needle, a bear had his blood pressure taken, and the mouse got some tender loving care. We sat on the bed, while I pulled out one animal after another, until they were all taken care of and tucked in. </p>
<p>I suggested we read a book, and Amelia thought we should read it in the bedroom with the animals around us. She went running off to choose a few books, and came back with just one ... the little photo album of Amelia's first two years that Susan had given me as a gift a few years back. We went through it together, page by page, looking at every photo and commenting on most of them. Amelia pointed out a photo where she thought she looked like Finn; she remembered a sweater with horses on it, as Finn wears it now, and we laughed about how she used to stick her lips out in a big kissy pouchy mouth, and send Riku running! I pointed out my favourite hats of hers, and she laughed at the bare belly and boot/shoe shots when she loved to walk around in her Daddy's footwear. It was a really sweet time with her ... just the two of us. </p>
<p>In the car I had told Amelia that I had a video of Riku at his birthday in Japan, blowing out his candles. She said she hadn't made him a card, and asked if she could make one here. We sat together at the table while she wrote him a little note with just a bit of help from me with some of the words. However, she wrote "I miss you" all by herself at the end of the first sentence, and signed it "Love, Amelia" too. There was room for a picture for him too, and I sat beside her as she drew a picture of the two of them. Amelia draws well, starting out in pencil to my surprise, and then colouring in all the details very carefully. She did a great job, and was rushing to finish it off before Kevin arrived. </p>
<p>I am hoping we can get back to our once-a-week visits, and we have four weeks left before I leave for Ontario. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/an_evening_with_barbara_kingso.html">A Relaxing Evening with Barbara Kingsolver, after a Busy Day at Home</a></h2>
								<p>I spent the day at home, continuing to putter about, getting things done. I ordered a few books online for the children for Christmas, with a long list on hand and lots of help from Doug. I don't enjoy ordering over the Internet but Doug does it so often that it's much faster to sit beside him and let him do his thing. </p>
<p>Emails are slowly but surely being answered, although it's funny how it all works. I send off three and get two back, send off four and two come up. At the end of one day, after feeling I had been answering emails the entire time, I went to bed with exactly the same number in that inbox and I had when my day began! </p>
<p>Today I heard from two far-flung friends/relatives with lots of news, and I answered immediately. I would so much rather get caught up this way then try to do it in the Christmas cards, so must plug away at it. </p>
<p>One of the many gifts I received from Susan and Kevin was a pair of tickets to see Barbara Kingsolver, one of my favourite authors. I was given her most current book at the time too, the non-fiction "Animal,Vegetable, Miracle".  </p>
<p>Her books are always compelling stories, detailed, and guaranteed good reads, just my cup of tea. I was to have missed it, as I was booked for Japan, but there are good sides to everything, and being able to see and hear Barbara Kingsolver tonight was proof of that. </p>
<p>Doug and I enjoyed this evening so much! I was tired, but the minute she started talking I was alert and interested. Barbara Kingsolver is such a warm and vibrant person; she was so comfortable talking about why and how she writes what she does, and is so obviously a people-person. Doug has not read any of her books but he is keen to get her newest, "The Lacuna" from the library. Turns out lots of other folks are too, as there is a waiting list of 66 people, so he may be reading it in the New Year. </p>
<p>It was a very relaxing way to end my evening, as was my small glass of cherry berry hard cider from Nanaimo. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/xxxx_doug_flies_off_to_british.html">Doug Flies Off to British Columbia and An Evening With Amelia and Finn</a></h2>
								<p>When Doug first went into the hospital, and was so disoriented days after that, we wondered if he would be able to go to Nanaimo to help Gail and Tom buy a new computer and set it up for them. They had paid for his ticket, and he was looking forward to his week away. He's been the one driving me to the airport lately and some time away is good for everyone. So, with clearance from the audiology specialist two visits ago, he was on his way this morning! His flight left at 10:58 and we left the house at 9:45. He wrote to tell me once he was there, that having a cane gave him some privileges that he could get used to; he must have been moved to the front of a couple of lines, and he's not sure that travelling with one is a bad idea at all. Perhaps he could add this item to his carry-on list!</p>
<p>It was strange to come into the house on my own; it's been a long time since I had a week of time alone. The phone didn't ring, the house was very quiet, and I didn't do as much as I thought I would today, somehow just settling in first, I guess, and doing a bit of this and a bit of that over the course of the day. </p>
<p>I had promised Kelly I would walk each day from now on. I am so aware of the children needing fresh air and exercise and never fail to get them outside each day, even it we are in the garden sweeping and playing, but the minute they leave, I forget that I need to do the same for myself! <br />
I know I need it; I read every single day about how important it is, and yet I will spend days here without doing more than walking to the mailbox and back. So, when it was time to get the mail today, I put on my shoes and jacket and off I went! </p>
<p>It was chilly when I first stepped out and I wished I had a light scarf around my neck, but of course within ten minutes I was unzipping my jacket and appreciating the warm sun! I walked down to the foot of Potrero Avenue, just to hear and see children playing in the playground there. There is a good concrete footpath around the entire park, except for one area where you have to climb a hill. I was back too soon to my own corner, and so walked up a hilly block, walked along the street behind our house, down past our house and up, and down the steps I walked with Riku every time I took him to school. I was panting more than I used to, of course, and decided that every time I walk from now on, I will end by doing these steps. I was still home within thirty-five minutes, but I was walking fast! </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin have tickets to see Isabella Rossellini tonight, and I went over to babysit. I had leftovers to heat up for dinner, and so got to Waller Street at 7 P.M. The children were watching TV, with their baths and dinner over by then. I watched a bit with them, then it was teeth-brushing time. I was able to read to Amelia before Susan and Kevin left, and she promised to stay in bed and fall asleep on her own tonight, something she was doing months ago, but had a setback about two months ago. She was offered five marbles tonight as a reward for doing this again, and those marbles will give her a head start on the next gift she receives for doing all her chores. </p>
<p>I snuggled in next to Finn with three board books, and what a character he is! At first he loved my rendition of "Five Little Ducks" as they wandered over the hill and far away, but as they disappeared and the mommy duck got sadder, he asked me to stop. And when all five ducks appeared again, he was all smiles! I guess that mommy duck being sad was just a bit more than he wanted to think about.</p>
<p>Amelia appeared at the door, a little upset, and asked if she could listen to us read. Finn wasn't all that keen to share either space or much of a look at the book at first, but I reminded him he would be sad if Amelia didn't let him do the same, and so he moved over, and Amelia thoughtfully thanked him. When it came time to turn out the light, I asked Finn to stay in bed, while I tucked in Amelia. It was a little dicey as to what might happen, as he asked to come with me, but he was very co-operative and stayed put. I told Amelia I would be back asap to cuddle with her, but that it was important that she stay in bed until Finn was asleep. She asked if she could stay outside her door, but I instead left her door open and the hall light on. </p>
<p>Finn fell asleep quickly (he hadn't napped today) but as Susan had told me, the minute I tried to move his eyes opened as though he hadn't been sleeping at all! I told him I had to check on Amelia and in just those fifteen minutes she was sound asleep! What a girl! </p>
<p>Finn and I continued our little dance for another hour and twenty minutes. He fell asleep, I stayed for a bit and then got out of bed, Finn woke up, taking my hand at one point to keep track of me(!) but I managed to get out of his room at 9:40. Susan and Kevin arrived home half an hour later, and we chatted for a bit; they enjoyed the evening out and the "conversation" with Isabella so much, and I was home not long after 10:30. </p>
<p>Doug had called just as I was about to dash out the door so we will likely talk tomorrow. He had sent an email telling me about his trip there, and missed the sandwich he had bought at Rainbow yesterday for his lunch on the plane. I enjoyed half of it for lunch today as it is not a sandwich one could freeze.</p>
<p>I had hoped that Bryn would have Riku call on Skype, as he would be home from school by 10:30 my time, but there was no message from them. I did talk to the children last Saturday but it seems a long time, those six days ...  </p>
<p>I was cold and tired, so read a couple of emails while my two "bed buddies" heated up, and was in bed at just past 11 P.M..</p>
<p><a href="/i/2009-11-19%20Amelia-ready-for-sleep.jpg"><img height="200" src="/i/2009-11-19%20Amelia-ready-for-sleep-thumb.jpg" width="300"></a></p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/solo_friday.html">Solo Friday</a></h2>
								<p>I woke far too early this morning, at 5:30, but came downstairs, turned on the heat, and crawled back into bed to read while the house warmed up. It was cold again this morning... 62F, but it seems much colder than that without Doug's warm back beside me. I hoped I might fall asleep, though, and sure enough I did, and woke much more ready for my day at 7:45. </p>
<p>The day was dark and overcast, and by the time I ate my late breakfast it was really dark and the rain had pouring down, the kind of rain that makes a lot of noise on the glass ceiling in the eating area when it starts. I loved it ... the sound of it, the darkness ... except for the bright glistening trees in the garden soaking it all up! I always feel very productive on days like this, and so I was today, getting through lots of random odd jobs.</p>
<p>I also curled up in the living room and ate my lunch, the last half of the delicious sandwich that Doug was to have taken to eat on the plane yesterday. It was sliced marinated tofu, on a bed of greens, topped with sun-dried tomatoes, all on a lovely gently crusted roll. That, and a cup of hot tea, was the perfect meal for me, as I got through two more magazines from my once-overflowing basket. </p>
<p>At 3 P.M. I went out for my walk, as I had promised Kelly I would. Today I decided not to look at my watch until I was close to home, so once again walked quickly to and around the children's playground off Potrero Avenue, said hello in reply to the one child on the climbing structure, the only child in the entire play area today(!), and I stopped to take a couple of photos of some skateboarders nearby at the skateboard circle. How Bryant would enjoy going there in March, so I sure hope the visit happens. </p>
<p>I walked along Potrero Avenue, past the hospital, walking up the hill and behind it, before heading once more up the hill towards Riku's old school, then down those 132 steps. I checked my watch and was happy to see that I had indeed been out for the requisite forty-five minutes! </p>
<p>Lots of emails answered, although just as many came in too, and I worked on some photos, spent a little time on the family tree, slotting in some information that came in from a cousin in England this morning, and went through another two magazines after dinner, with my second cup of tea of the day. </p>
<p>As I go through these magazines, my list of books grows ever-longer! I remember saying once, many years ago, that a perfect trip for me would be a cruise around the world on a very slow moving ship, with a steamer trunk loaded with all the books it could hold from my book list ... and that dream still holds. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/xxx_a_perfectly_lovely_day.html">A Perfectly Lovely Day</a></h2>
								<p>I made myself some scrambled eggs for breakfast today, cooked just the way I like them and served with two slices of "bacon". A big mug of hot chocolate finished it off while I read the paper. </p>
<p>Caillie rang; she was snuggled up in bed at her Dad's, with a sore eye. She had knocked it on a desk at school yesterday and this morning it was infected and goopy and closed shut. However, she was in good spirits and we chatted for over forty-five minutes about this and that. She now has a pair of jeans, her first ever! I'm hoping to see a photo of her in them, but if she doesn't get around to it, I will be seeing her in less than a month. The time is flying by, of course!</p>
<p>Susan called this morning to see if I would like to join them at Union Square downtown while they ice-skated with the children. Actually, she fully intended to get me on skates too! I had plans to get out to a bookstore sale early, and after she told me her intentions I was very glad I had an excuse not to go! I tried many many times when I was a child, and once as an adult to skate, but my fear of falling gets in the way every time. Whew! </p>
<p>I went off to the West Portal neighbourhood and spent two hours there, really puttering about the bookstore and choosing books for the children with the help of a very knowledgable staff member, who seems to have read every children's book they stock! I only bought four books, but came home with a long list of possibilities for gifts down the road. There is a wonderful toy store in the neighbourhood too, so I ambled around there for a bit, just for fun, and then poked in and out of several other stores there as well. I tried to talk myself into a bun or cookie or something at the bakery but none of it appealed to me at all. I had deliberately parked a few blocks away from the main street so I could get my walk in this way today. </p>
<p>From there I drove to Noe Valley. For many years I was up in that neighbourhood at least once a week. There are many wonderful little cafes and restaurants, oodles of interesting shops, and a nice ambience too, with lots of couples, family groups with their dogs in tow, and healthy looking seniors bustling about. But over the past few years many stores had closed and whenever I did get there for my hair cuts, it just felt sad and neglected. </p>
<p>I knew a big "natural" food store had gone in there, and was very surprised to see a few less empty shops. It was fun seeing the Christmas decorations up in many of them, along with lots of things to think about buying if one had the money! But I didn't really intend to do anything but window shop anyway and thoroughly enjoyed that. </p>
<p>I was contemplating what to do for an early dinner, but had decided I could treat myself to something that I hadn't made myself. "Whole Earth" has lots of yummy vegetarian options to just heat up, and a favourite take-out dish for many years has been the sauteed tofu with broccoli and sauce from a old established Chinese restaurant. Kelly and I used to treat ourselves to this dish often, and sometimes sat in the car eating while one of the children napped.</p>
<p>However, I walked much further along the street than usual, just to continue my walk, and as I started back up to the main part of the street again, I spotted a brand new spot I hadn't seen before. It was busy and bustling with people lined up along a counter to order. I had no intention of eating out, but once I saw the menu on the wall, I changed my mind. It is the newest of a small chain of perhaps three or four spots called "Belanger"; Susan told me later that "Cafe Soleil" kitty corner to them is part of a it. The biggest problem I had was deciding what to order. The cauliflower soup sounded wonderful, as did several of the open faced sandwiches served with greens. </p>
<p>I finally opted for a veggie burger (after first checking to make sure it wasn't a commercially made one), with their homemade potato chips. I am a huge potato chip fan, so much so that I won't buy them to have in the house, as a full bag to me is just a reason to open it and eat every last crunchy bit hiding in the corners ... even the big bags! All three of my sisters like them too, but two can only eat a few, before feeling ill, and the other can eat a lot of them, but then feels sick later on. Not me, no problem! </p>
<p>I chose a table by the window, spotted a man next to me with his lovely looking salad as a side, and realized I should have ordered that too. So, I dashed up and asked if I could change my mind. Of course I could and the gal promised it would be up in just a few minutes. When the waiter brought it over, there was this wonderful looking sandwich tucked beside a lovely number of thin crispy chips! I did tell him I had changed my order, he offered to take it back and change it, I asked if those chips were now going to be thrown away (I would have kept them if they were), but he made such a kind suggestion. I could just eat them and he would bring me the salad on the side as well. Oh, what a lovely man he was! </p>
<p>Every bite of this meal was delicious! I ate the chips first as I always do (best to get them out of the way!), and then the sandwich ... a perfectly warmed soft French roll, some seasoned greens, with a very thin, quite firm, tasty patty topping them, then a seasoned and grilled portobello mushroom, and topped with two slices of Brie, just warm enough that it was starting to melt. Oh my gosh! I will be eating this dish again, but without the chips next time. That was just a little gift from heaven for me today. </p>
<p>I was more than ready for a hot cup of tea and a soft sofa when I got home. Susan called, kindly asking if I would like to join them for Amici's (my favourite!) pizza at their place, but of course I could not have eaten even one slice, so I declined, leaving them to dine with friends and their children, also invited over.</p>
<p>The next few hours passed by in the usual way. I had hoped to talk with the children in Japan when I got home, but even though I left IM and email messages I didn't hear back from Bryn until the children were all bundled up and ready to leave with their parents for a playdate with most of Mirei's classmates at what is supposed to be one of the nicer play areas in the city. They had been busy with other things and not on the computer, so Bryn assured me that they would connect tomorrow for sure. </p>
<p>The evening flew by too quickly, and I am heading up to bed much too late.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/moms_nightie_and_a_chatty_sund.html">Mom's Nightie, and a Chatty Sunday</a></h2>
								<p>I have been chilly at night since Doug left, and had switched on Friday night to a long sleeveless nightie, much warmer than my usual short spaghetti-strap one. I still woke a few times that night, burrowing in deeper to keep and stay warm. So, last night I pulled out the heavy artillery, a long full flannel nightie with sleeves, one that Kelly had made for my mom over fifteen years ago. Mom had been complaining about not being warm enough, and Kelly made two of the same pattern for her. Mom loved them so much; they are full enough that you can pull your legs and feet right up into them, they don't bind anywhere, and you can even twirl like a ballerina in them, and check out how little and feminine one looks in it while doing so. I had <strong>such</strong> a good sleep, right through until 8:20! </p>
<p>I basically puttered about again today. I like these days of mine a lot; I am cooking simple yummy meals for myself. For breakfast today I had a bowl of oatmeal with nuts and seeds, and have been sauteeing spinach, serving it over brown rice with veggies, eating big salads, a daily fruit bowl with yogurt, and nibbling healthy things during the day. They're all quick and easy and perfect for me. </p>
<p>I connected with lots of family today and it was grand. Caillie called on the phone, Bryn Skyped with me, and I got to talk with Mirei for a long time, and with Riku long enough for him to show me his latest transformer, a dark "bad" guy. Mirei showed me a book that she says was a little scary (skulls), holding it up carefully so I could see it, and turning over each page carefully so I didn't miss any of it. Doug called through on Skype too, mostly to check which of Gail's two microphones worked best, but Gail and I had a few minutes to talk too. My great-niece Ashleigh sent a message on IM and so I chatted first with her and then her little sister Felicia, who added me as a friend on Facebook. And, speaking of Facebook, I also had a message when I awoke from a second cousin in Liverpool, a brand new connection! And last but not least, Uncle Frank rang through a half hour before his dinner time, and we chatted and then reconnected again three hours later and talked for close to two hours! </p>
<p>That was it ... laundry, lots of paper sorting, time with my feet up going through several more magazines, but not much emailing, as I spent a lot of time on family tree in between jobs, trying to clear away some of that paper work! All in all, a productive day, although I realized as soon as it got dark, that I hadn't been out for my walk! It just disappeared in a flurry of chats today! I will make up for it tomorrow for certain. </p>
<p>I snapped a few photos of Riku and Mirei and of her with her dad, but they shall have to wait to get posted until Doug gets home. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/happy_american_thanksgiving_an.html">Happy (American) Thanksgiving ... and Doug Arrives Home!</a></h2>
								<p>I woke at 5 this morning and had trouble nodding off again, so turned the light on and read for an hour, putting my very exciting book, "Searching for Nouf", down just one chapter before the end! However, I knew I needed the extra sleep and was very happy to awaken at 7:45! </p>
<p>I hurried downstairs to turn the heat on, and shower, as I thought Amelia might be coming over for a visit with me this morning. Finn will be busy with his Spanish sitter as is usual on a Thursday, and I knew Kevin and Susan would be busy making their big Thanksgiving dinner. However, no call came and I spent lots of time with my siblings exchanging funny childhood memories via email. </p>
<p>I wrapped some gifts this morning and got one lot ready for mailing tomorrow, so now my counter looks that much tidier. I answered emails, one to a dear friend, Carol, whose mother passed away yesterday; her mom had a serious stroke two days ago but this was still unexpected so soon.</p>
<p>I picked Doug up at the airport at 3 P.M. and we went to Safeway for some produce before heading home. I had decided this morning that we would have a Thanksgiving dinner tonight.I had a delicious "Celebration Roast" in the freezer, a vegetarian entree we both had tried previously and liked a lot, but I needed bread for stuffing, and a turnip, for our feast. </p>
<p>Back at home, I got busy making Mom's stuffing, chatting with Doug, and catching up on all our news. This was always a special day for Uncle Frank, who is an American, so I called him and was happy to hear that By' and Neal were both in visiting with him. They were ready to leave, though, so we hung up for their goodbyes, and then Uncle Frank called me back. Glenn called in the two or three minutes between our calls, so it was good to hear that lots of people were thinking about him today. </p>
<p>While I peeled, chopped, sauteed, grated, and stirred, Uncle Frank and I chatted about all sorts of things ... poetry, his table-mates at the retirement home, photos of the children I had sent on, the video of Riku skateboarding, his physical therapist and fitness routine — he's so happy with them both — and relatives in England. We were on the phone for well over an hour and when we said goodbye dinner was ready to go on the table! </p>
<p>Doug was delighted, as he hadn't expected a special dinner at all. This is not a typical dinner for us at all, and Doug always comments on these "real" dinners as he says ... meaning the kind we grew up with ... an entree (the sage flavoured "roast"), at least extra two veggies (Mom's traditional carrots and turnips mashed together with butter), plus mashed potatoes (I now use a combination of sweet and white), cranberry sauce, and gravy. </p>
<p>I realized once we got home that I had forgotten to buy the Brussel sprouts, so may pick those up tomorrow and serve it when we have hot "turkey" sandwiches for tomorrow's dinner. It was very very tasty! </p>
<p>Bryn sent me a voice recording tonight from his IPhone, another lovely surprise after receiving his video of Riku last night. He had just taken Riku to his piano lesson on his bike; they were a bit rushed, it is a longish way from their home, some of it uphill, and it was gorgeous with a hot sun shining (65ºF). Bryn was hot and tired when they arrived and so decided to stay outside while Riku had his lesson. He tested his newly discovered recording abilities and taped a chatty little message to me;  I could hear birds singing in the background! Not only did I hear Bryn's voice very clearly, but I get to keep the recording, as I do the video of Riku, and play them whenever I like. Can't wait to get more of these and with Riku and Mirei's voices too! Not too much later a lovely photo of Riku came in, surrounded by beautiful trees in autumn colours, taken on their way home for the lesson. </p>
<p>Doug processed some blog photos for me from the last few days, but was feeling quite disoriented and his vision was not right. He did tell me on the way home today that he was not noticing any changes at all, despite time and the exercises he has been doing, so is even more discouraged right now. I hope tomorrow is better for him. </p>
<p>(I just looked at the photo of my dinner, and yup, there is a place there for those missing Brussels sprouts! I shall have to take another shot of dinner tomorrow night!) </p>
<p>I'm off to finish that last chapter, and then I get to choose a new book! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/small_blessings.html">Small Blessings</a></h2>
								<p>This did not start out to be my day. I woke at 4 A.M. and could not get back to sleep, no matter which way I turned or how many relaxation exercises I tried. I didn't want to disturb Doug by turning on even my tiny flashlight as he hadn't been feeling well at bedtime last night. </p>
<p>I gave up at 5:30, and came downstairs with two bed buddies in hand, intending to crawl into bed downstairs in the guest room with newly warmed "buddies". While I waited for them to heat, I checked my email and decided to write to a friend I hadn't written to for far too long. It always takes me a while when responding to an older email as there is lots of catching up to do. </p>
<p>At 6:30, after answering two more, I had almost convinced myself to just stay up. Common sense prevailed though, as I know that with just four hours sleep I would not get much accomplished anyway. So, I tucked in, read for perhaps five minutes and woke at 8:15. Yahoo! </p>
<p>For various reasons it was an emotional day for me. I talked to two of my sisters, took a very very long hot shower, and really pampered myself with lots of lotion and a lovely lavender rub on the back of my neck and earlobes and felt much much better. </p>
<p>I am having worrisome ... not pain, exactly, but a stretching feel on the left side of my abdomen, which is just huge right now and is just not flat lately, even in the mornings before I have had any wheat. If I stretch or pull to the side I can feel something is not quite right, and yet I cannot feel a lump or anything like the hernia I have thought it might be. So, that is niggling in the back of my mind as I am constantly aware of it. Until I can get a colonoscopy done I won't be feeling good about any of this.</p>
<p>I thought we might head out to do some shopping today, but instead was happy to just stay put. We did go out though to buy those Brussels sprouts we didn't have with our dinner last night, and I mailed the second part of UF's birthday gift to him, as well as a package for the children in Japan. </p>
<p>We came back to find two photos from Bryn waiting; they were all at a clinic to get the Swine flu shot for the children and the regular flu shot for the adults. The photos were of Riku and Mirei in a play area, and the second showed the well built house they had made together. </p>
<p>I was quite sure that Riku would be okay getting his shot, and he was, and I was equally sure that Mirei would not be, and she wasn't. I was very happy to be able to talk to her about it all via Skype soon after we got home. Mirei wanted to show me where she had her two needles... they must have had both shots... so she told me to "just wait right there!" and went off to pull off her first layer. I had seen part of her pretty undershirt and she was very happy to show it to me in full. Lovely. When I asked her if she cried, she said she screamed "but I was only fooling around." Right. We chatted a little bit and Riku popped his head around her shoulder to say hello too. We had to hang up too soon, as it was time for their lunch and Riku's tutor was there, but my heart lifted after that call; I got some sweet pics of them too, as well as some funny tongue shots from the two of them! Blessings for sure... </p>
<p>They had hoped to get one of the only shipment of Christmas trees today, sold at IKEA, but they had sold out already when Akane called. Now they have to look at what other options they have but  I'm sure they will come up with something. Wouldn't it be nice if IKEA realized that they could sell lots more and bring in more? They were only charging $20 per tree, although they were not sure what size they were.  </p>
<p>Doug and I had delicious leftovers tonight, but with the perfectly cooked Brussels sprouts we missed out on last night. Still to come... potato cakes with an egg for a late breakfast tomorrow, and hot turkey sandwiches for another day. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a taped "Gray's Anatomy" episode later on with a big plate of fresh fruit for dessert... half of the wonderful Honey Crisp apples we just recently discovered, a Mandarin orange each and lots of crisp crunchy red grapes. </p>
<p>I've been working on emails and photos since then, and talked to Sheldon later in the evening as well, a nice surprise call from him.  </p>
<p>No "now" photo from Susan's iPhone in two days. I wrote to her tonight telling her I missed them, and I had a newsy email back from her; busy two days for her, of course, with lots of plans, but we made tentative arrangements for the children to come over, perhaps on Sunday. </p>
<p>I've been listening to Susan Boyle's just-released DVD this evening and have so enjoyed it; "Wild Horses" is so beautifully sung. </p>
<p>Just before bedtime Bryn sent me a sweet photo of Mirei taking his drink "order"; she told him she didn't have any beer, but had "tea with apple juice'. A little later I received a photo of a "real princess"... a quick change of lifestyle for our used-to-be-waitress! </p>
<p>Bedtime. I won't be reading long tonight. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/sunday_in_japan_saturday_in_sa.html">Saturday in San Francisco; Sunday in Japan</a></h2>
								<p>It's always lovely to know what is going on in Japan as the distance between us are too far, and the hours between us too many ... seventeen.</p>
<p>I find myself several times a day checking my watch to see what time it is in Kyoto, and what our little family might be doing at that time ... sleeping, getting ready for school, in class, at piano for both children, Mirei on the bus on her way to or from school, or karate practice for Riku.  </p>
<p>When we are just getting up in San Francisco, they are sound asleep with that day behind them. About 2:30 P.M. here, during the week, I know the children are getting ready for school, and Riku leaves about a half hour later. At 10 P.M. here I know that Riku is close to being home from school, but Mirei won't be for another two hours. </p>
<p>And so go my days; if I'm not thinking about the family in Japan I am checking to see if the four children in Toronto are still in school, or if Kelly is close to getting home from her day at school. </p>
<p>The only children I can easily keep track of are Amelia and Finn. Thank goodness someone stayed put and are in the same time zone.</p>
<p>Now I know how my mother must have felt when Doug and I moved to Vancouver with <strong>her</strong> grandchildren! </p>
<p>Susan is so good about sending me two or three photos a day letting me know what she is up to with the children, and so I see Finn at Baker Beach, or munching on grilled cheese sandwiches, riding on a carousel, or scooting along on his wooden bike. And I get to see Amelia at her circus class, getting her hair cut, or playing on a beach with Sheena, her best friend. </p>
<p>Now that Bryn has an iPhone too, I get lots more photos from him, and so sometimes at the end of my day, in comes one like that below; I get to find out that their meal tonight was saginaki... taken at dinner time at home ... and I get to see that there is a little manger in the background and wonder whether Mirei plays with the baby and the animals. It all helps. </p>
<p>p.s. Bryn sent a short IM saying Mirei had done a little skateboarding today! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/11/video.html">Dickens Christmas Faire</a></h2>
								<p>Susan kindly gave us two free tickets to the annual "Dickens Christmas Faire", held in the Cow Palace in San Francisco. This was a wonderful start to the Christmas season. </p>
<p>Doug and I have been twice before several years ago, and took Riku with us both times. The first year there was a wonderful display of wooden parts for castle building and Riku had a great time. He also chose a long glass beaded ornament to hang on the Christmas tree. The second time we went he quite enjoyed listening to the rousing music and watching the dancers on stage. They had a wonderful Victorian Santa there too, who was of course a huge hit, especially since he was a really gentle, soft-spoken Santa. </p>
<p>This huge venue is done up as Victorian streets, complete with shops, cafes where you can buy scones and tea, restaurants for fish and chips, and pubs and bars for cider and beer, etc. The very best part of all are the 3000 actors (though not all there at the same time) walking around in period clothing, keeping in character with their various British accents, from the highbrow to the scruffiest accent imaginable. If you are walking by and hear a couple talking they are doing so in their accents, discussing matters of the "day" way back when. We stopped to watch a foursome of young people playing a game; it was a delight to listen to them talk in their chosen dialects, and as we approached one of the gals called out to us "e's cheatin' Ma'm, 'e is!" and the other chorused in to second it. It's just the most fun! </p>
<p>Because we were on our own, we sat and watched a two-hour range of entertainment at "Big Sal's" saloon. There was singing, dancing, and bawdy plays, and we got to join in and sing along too at times. The entire cast was obviously having a grand ol' time, as were we. We were there for over three hours; there wasn't much of a crowd when we arrived later in the day on the first weekend, and so the actors far outnumbered us this time. </p>
<p>Later that evening Bryn sent <a href="http://bit.ly/4SuPXj"><u>a lovely video of the children</u></a> tossing rocks into a stream at the back of a café they had been to. It was Sunday afternoon for them, and such a treat for me to see them and hear their voices at the end of my day. </p>
