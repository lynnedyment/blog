								<h2>An Early Morning Call... and Some Blasts From the Past</h2>
								<p>The phone rang at 8 A.M. today, one of the very rare days when I was still sleeping at that hour. I had awakened at 2 o'clock and had trouble getting back to sleep, no doubt due to the lists I was making in my head! It was Don, my "baby" brother. We're in touch often through emails, exchanging family news and photos, but it was wonderful to hear his voice. </p>
<p>Don and Tessa are coming to Niagara Falls on the 27th of December, and we are all very excited about this. Doug and Don haven't seen each other for well over twelve years, we think, and Kelly will be introducing him to Gregg for the first time. Don hasn't seen any of his nieces and nephews in the Falls for many years, and many of them have never met Tessa, now eleven years old. All eight siblings were together at a family wedding in 2008, but that is a long time to be away from a sibling. Sadly Gail won't be with us this year; often she and Don are the only two missing from our Boxing Day event. This will still be held, I believe, as we gather with friends there too, but we are also all looking forward to being at Beth's and Paul's on the 27th for this unexpected family reunion. Yahoo! </p>
<p>Days continue to be quiet and productive. I have been working hard at reducing the number of emails in my in-box. I can remember years ago when I felt that having ten to answer was a backlog, and a few months ago I had over 650 messages waiting to be answered/read/tossed and/or filed. </p>
<p>Belonging to Ancestry these past few years is part of the reason for the backlog, as I frequently get emails either from individuals or from Ancestry itself, suggesting connections in my family tree. Moving those to a separate folder at least separated the personal from the tree-related. </p>
<p>Another part of the backlog were photos that Doug creates for my blog entries. When life got very busy last year I often put the photos into the almost daily spots, but did not move the photos out. But there were also many times when they just weren't put in the written blog spots, so after tackling that huge job over these past few months, I am now down to a grand total of 125 entries! I will be very pleased when I am back to that "backlog" of ten again! </p>
<p>Doug is feeling much the same as he did almost two weeks ago. He felt a little more off balance in the morning, although that improved slightly during the day. I know he's looking forward to having the test tomorrow over and done with, if only to perhaps get another opinion as to what is going on with him. </p>
<p>We had a typically quiet evening, watching the last in a series of three British detective shows, I went through more emails, getting blog photos off my desktop and into folders, and we both went off to bed at 11 P.M. </p>
<p>I do hate to see a photo-less blog entry and so here is a set of photos from November the 10th in years gone by. </p>
<p>We have Riku, in 2003, just three days before he turned a year old, up to no good at all in my kitchen! </p>
<p>This day in 2004 found me taking Amelia for a walk in her stroller in Golden Gate Park, and then some time at her home with her too. </p>
<p>Riku loved doing puzzles in 2005, when he was just about to turn three. Hard puzzles too, but he could do them on his own, just as his dad could at that age. I took photos of the beginning and almost at the end of the puzzle session this day. </p>
<p>And three years ago today, in 2006, we went to the Oakland Zoo with Riku and Amelia.</p>
