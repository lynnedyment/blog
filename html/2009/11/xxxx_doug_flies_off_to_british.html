								<h2>Doug Flies Off to British Columbia and An Evening With Amelia and Finn</h2>
								<p>When Doug first went into the hospital, and was so disoriented days after that, we wondered if he would be able to go to Nanaimo to help Gail and Tom buy a new computer and set it up for them. They had paid for his ticket, and he was looking forward to his week away. He's been the one driving me to the airport lately and some time away is good for everyone. So, with clearance from the audiology specialist two visits ago, he was on his way this morning! His flight left at 10:58 and we left the house at 9:45. He wrote to tell me once he was there, that having a cane gave him some privileges that he could get used to; he must have been moved to the front of a couple of lines, and he's not sure that travelling with one is a bad idea at all. Perhaps he could add this item to his carry-on list!</p>
<p>It was strange to come into the house on my own; it's been a long time since I had a week of time alone. The phone didn't ring, the house was very quiet, and I didn't do as much as I thought I would today, somehow just settling in first, I guess, and doing a bit of this and a bit of that over the course of the day. </p>
<p>I had promised Kelly I would walk each day from now on. I am so aware of the children needing fresh air and exercise and never fail to get them outside each day, even it we are in the garden sweeping and playing, but the minute they leave, I forget that I need to do the same for myself! <br />
I know I need it; I read every single day about how important it is, and yet I will spend days here without doing more than walking to the mailbox and back. So, when it was time to get the mail today, I put on my shoes and jacket and off I went! </p>
<p>It was chilly when I first stepped out and I wished I had a light scarf around my neck, but of course within ten minutes I was unzipping my jacket and appreciating the warm sun! I walked down to the foot of Potrero Avenue, just to hear and see children playing in the playground there. There is a good concrete footpath around the entire park, except for one area where you have to climb a hill. I was back too soon to my own corner, and so walked up a hilly block, walked along the street behind our house, down past our house and up, and down the steps I walked with Riku every time I took him to school. I was panting more than I used to, of course, and decided that every time I walk from now on, I will end by doing these steps. I was still home within thirty-five minutes, but I was walking fast! </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin have tickets to see Isabella Rossellini tonight, and I went over to babysit. I had leftovers to heat up for dinner, and so got to Waller Street at 7 P.M. The children were watching TV, with their baths and dinner over by then. I watched a bit with them, then it was teeth-brushing time. I was able to read to Amelia before Susan and Kevin left, and she promised to stay in bed and fall asleep on her own tonight, something she was doing months ago, but had a setback about two months ago. She was offered five marbles tonight as a reward for doing this again, and those marbles will give her a head start on the next gift she receives for doing all her chores. </p>
<p>I snuggled in next to Finn with three board books, and what a character he is! At first he loved my rendition of "Five Little Ducks" as they wandered over the hill and far away, but as they disappeared and the mommy duck got sadder, he asked me to stop. And when all five ducks appeared again, he was all smiles! I guess that mommy duck being sad was just a bit more than he wanted to think about.</p>
<p>Amelia appeared at the door, a little upset, and asked if she could listen to us read. Finn wasn't all that keen to share either space or much of a look at the book at first, but I reminded him he would be sad if Amelia didn't let him do the same, and so he moved over, and Amelia thoughtfully thanked him. When it came time to turn out the light, I asked Finn to stay in bed, while I tucked in Amelia. It was a little dicey as to what might happen, as he asked to come with me, but he was very co-operative and stayed put. I told Amelia I would be back asap to cuddle with her, but that it was important that she stay in bed until Finn was asleep. She asked if she could stay outside her door, but I instead left her door open and the hall light on. </p>
<p>Finn fell asleep quickly (he hadn't napped today) but as Susan had told me, the minute I tried to move his eyes opened as though he hadn't been sleeping at all! I told him I had to check on Amelia and in just those fifteen minutes she was sound asleep! What a girl! </p>
<p>Finn and I continued our little dance for another hour and twenty minutes. He fell asleep, I stayed for a bit and then got out of bed, Finn woke up, taking my hand at one point to keep track of me(!) but I managed to get out of his room at 9:40. Susan and Kevin arrived home half an hour later, and we chatted for a bit; they enjoyed the evening out and the "conversation" with Isabella so much, and I was home not long after 10:30. </p>
<p>Doug had called just as I was about to dash out the door so we will likely talk tomorrow. He had sent an email telling me about his trip there, and missed the sandwich he had bought at Rainbow yesterday for his lunch on the plane. I enjoyed half of it for lunch today as it is not a sandwich one could freeze.</p>
<p>I had hoped that Bryn would have Riku call on Skype, as he would be home from school by 10:30 my time, but there was no message from them. I did talk to the children last Saturday but it seems a long time, those six days ...  </p>
<p>I was cold and tired, so read a couple of emails while my two "bed buddies" heated up, and was in bed at just past 11 P.M..</p>
