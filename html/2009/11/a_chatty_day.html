								<h2>A  Chatty Sunday</h2>
								<p>Today felt like Monday to me for some reason, so much so, that despite knowing it wasn't, I felt compelled to do the laundry, as I always do on Monday! Yesterday I was convinced it was Friday, and so the last few days have felt out of sync' for me. </p>
<p>I plowed through so many emails today, which felt just grand! I must have had over fifty sets of photos chosen as pics for my blog entries, backed up from over a year ago, and so slowly but surely over the past week, Doug has kindly been turning them into "blog-size" for me. It has been fun, actually, since I got to re-read blogs from last December, and see all the photos I took of those days before and after Christmas. I am very pleased to have gone from a high of over 650 emails and attachments to just 160 tonight! A large number of Ancestry hints, from my family tree work, have been transferred to another folder, but at least now I know I am dealing only with photos and emails that need answering and/or filing. </p>
<p>I got in a couple of the Ancestry hints that come in now and then, and spent a happy hour adding more sources to people already in my tree. It's good to be back at it, although I must keep at the Christmas cards too, as I didn't write even one today. </p>
<p>It was quite the day for connecting with people, and Caillie started it off with a call from her Dad's this morning. She calls quite frequently and I was happy to sit on the sofa with a cup of tea, feet up, and catch up on Hallowe'en, how she was feeling — she was running a high fever and coughing last week — and of course how messy her room was. The answer? "Oh my gosh, only six weeks until you get here?"! </p>
<p>I have been missing Skype calls with Garry in Sweden, which means I haven't seen as much of his darling one-and-a-half-year-old Freija. Today I was home, and didn't have a busy child with me, and so Freija and I showed each other our Raggedy Ann dolls and I got to say hi to her. She is lovely. I sat and watched videos of her last night, and what a character she is! She climbs, and dances, and admires her belly button, and walks ever so nicely with her Grandpa in Lion's Bay. I love to hear her mom laughing away in the background of the video. </p>
<p>Much to my surprise, Garry has a full beard! He looks so very different, and reminded me a lot of my nephew Michael. Garry looks great with a beard, and he chuckled when I told him how much I like it. Apparently so do most of the Swedes he knows, including Line, and they don't want him to shave it. However, they are all off to Thailand for three weeks and he wants it gone before that holiday. I managed to get a shot of Garry, even though it is quite dark, but Freija was tired, and I didn't get a photo of her this time. Coming up, though, at some point, for certain. </p>
<p>I phoned to talk to Amelia about her new loose tooth, and she was still very excited about it. It has been too long since Amelia has been over here on her own, and I was hoping she might be able to come and make cookies with me after school one day this week, or watch a movie with me here at home, or go to a playground ... her choice. She opted for baking together; we used to do this and both enjoyed it so much. I forget the exact phrase she used, but when I asked which day would work, she said something like "I have very busy days", but with Susan we decided that tomorrow would work out just fine. Great! It's a date! I think we will make chocolate chip, although I will let Amelia decide between those and oatmeal/raisin. </p>
<p>Doug and I had gone out to the bank, and to the grocery store, and picked up two "California Kitchen" margherita pizzas on sale for just $4.00 each. That seemed the perfect choice for dinner, and so it was, with added fresh tomato and some fresh Buffalo mozzarella cheese on both sides and sauteed spinach added to mine. We both enjoyed them so much, and the price was right, so we'll be having these once a week from now on. </p>
<p>We took our fruit upstairs to enjoy while watching a one-and-a-half-hour British detective show, from a series we have enjoyed in the past. </p>
