								<h2>Tuesday at Home</h2>
								<p>When I checked my email first thing this A.M., there was a message from Liz, suggesting a morning chat, to catch up on our lives since September. I had already showered, and so sat with a big mug of hot water, and enjoyed our one-hour phone visit. There was talk about the swine flu that is sweeping both countries, and what was going on with Doug, and whether or not I would make it to Japan next week or not. That seems to be less likely now, or at least leaving by Monday is, as I can't imagine at this stage that Doug is going to get better that quickly. </p>
<p>I also talked to Kelly today, who is still very sick with a bad cough. She has missed so many days of teaching and is feeling awful about not being with her students, but at least she is happy with the substitute teacher who is taking her place. Kelly is hoping to go to a first aid course on Friday, but she honestly sounds like she needs some first aid herself! I learned one piece of good news though: Kelly is going to be able to stay with her class until the end of the school year. Yay! There was some question as to whether another full-time teacher would be taking over in early December, but this has been resolved in Kelly's favour. I am so very happy for her Jr. K, and kindergarten students, as she is a kind and caringteacher, just perfect for their first year at school. </p>
<p>Gail and I worked, for the first time in far too long, on our family tree for an hour in the late afternoon. She walked me through a mistake I had in my tree, and I filled her in on some information on a family with whom I connected on Facebook. We still have to look into it further, and there's not much time available for it, but it just feels good to be back at the tree, if only for an hour. </p>
<p>I wrote a few more Christmas cards, did some clearing away, ordered some gifts online with Doug putting in the actual orders for me, and felt as though I got lots done. However, at day's end it never feels as though I accomplished as much as I had hoped to. </p>
<p>I am feeling a little sad, knowing there is a good chance that I won't be with Riku on his birthday. However, I am not giving up quite yet, and won't cancel my ticket until it really looks as though there is no hope of leaving on Monday. </p>
<p>Doug and I cleared away another tape, although Doug mostly closes his eyes and listens to them, as he is still seeing double. For me, it feels as though watching these old tapes is also clearing things up, and gives me a chance to just sit and put my feet up too. My back thanks me on days like this. </p>
<p>We have to be up early tomorrow, at 6:30, to be ready to leave for Doug's doctor appointment at 7:30, so I am heading up to bed earlier than usual.</p>
<p>I'm so enjoying the beautiful flowers from Susan; I spent a lot of time in this kitchen area and all those gorgeous colours constantly catch my eye. </p>
