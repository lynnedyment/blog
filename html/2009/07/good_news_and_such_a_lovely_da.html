								<h2>Good News! ... Little Qualicum Falls, and Goats on the Roof!</h2>
								<p>I knew I wouldn't have an easy time sleeping last night until I had some word on how Riku was doing. I should have emailed Bryn last night instead of sending questioning messages via IM, as he can't access them once he has logged off his computer. I knew that, but somehow in my worried state I had forgotten, and just assumed that he was at the hospital or out with Mirei. So ... I woke up a half hour after falling asleep, tip-toed into the computer room, turned on the computer and there were no messages. It took a while to fall back asleep, and the fact that the room was so hot didn't help either, so at 3:15 A.M. I was back at the computer, this time with a very welcome message from Bryn saying Riku was a little better, that he and Mirei would visit them tomorrow, and that they had had a good day together. It's not often that she and her Dad have that much time alone, so I know that both of them enjoyed it very much. </p>
<p>Bryn had also let me know that he had posted three new blogs, so I went to his site and was delighted to see those two happy little faces, but did not dare turn up the volume so I could hear Mirei practicing on Riku's mouth piano! </p>
<p>Of course I was so relieved to hear that Riku was a little better, that my mind didn't stop whirling once I got to bed. At 4 A.M. I had to turn on the light and immerse myself in the fictional tale of the folks in Gail's Liverpool novel. It worked and I woke at 8:15!</p>
<p>So, on with our planned day out at a lovely waterfall ... Gail had been busy packing up fresh fruit, peppers, and drinks, and so after our usual game of cards with fruit and tea for breakfast, I made lentil loaf sandwiches for Tom and Doug, Gail packed up our favourite two salads, Greek and taboulleh, and off we went. </p>
<p>We left the house at 10:45 and headed off to the North Island Recovery Centre, about an hour or so away. It is a very well maintained huge shelter, with animals and birds kept both inside and outside in large clean pens and cages. All of the animals were rescued from sure deaths, and it was so inspiring to see wounded birds learning to fly again, and a baby bear in a huge bathtub dipping up and down in obvious delight. There were crows, ravens, owls, ducks, with lots of little children around paying lots of attention to them. Some big folks too!  As well as all of these, there was a huge exhibit room filled with various species of birds, including injured eagles in their own special room with lots of room to spread their wings, and fly... or at least move around safely, until they healed. There were insect collections too, and large animals such as cougars, all of whom had been rescued many many years ago, and their bodies preserved after death in the learning center. </p>
<p>We were very hungry and drove on until we reached our picnic spot, at the lovely Little Qualicum Falls. Tom has fond memories of visiting there as a boy, and hadn't been for years. There was a table in the shade for us, and after our very welcome and delicious lunch (especially since we were all really hungry by the time we got there), and a thermos of hot tea for Gail and me, we set off on a somewhat arduous but perfectly gorgeous hike up and down to a series of waterfalls. We took lots of photos, or at least Doug did, as waterfalls count among his very favourite things. We all agreed it was a lovely way to have finished up this part of our day. </p>
<p>On to Coombs, famed location of the market with the goats on the roof. It has grown and changed over the years from when we first went with Gail and Tom, and all the food items have become pricier than they used to be, but they still have a great and varied selection of goodies. We bought two large Cadbury's Fruit and Nut bars, imported from England, one of our favourite non-dark bars, some shortbread cookies for the drive home, and Doug found some cream-filled cookies to nibble on. He was tempted by the smell of the wonderful cheese bread they bake there, but the $6.00 price tag had him decide against buying it. We don't really have enough days left to do it justice anyway. Gail picked up some small whole wheat buns and a few other items too. </p>
<p>The long ice cream counter had been moved to an outside location, but thank goodness still had the coconut ice cream Gail and I enjoy so much. It was hot outside but we found a shady spot to eat most of it, and then Gail and I finished ours off in the car on the way home. </p>
<p>Of course this meant no one was very hungry for dinner, so Gail and I played cards, we changed into our lightweight dressing gowns early as it was too hot to wear anything else, and ended up with a late dinner of marinated grilled tofu, along with grilled new potatoes and asparagus. </p>
<p>I called Beth's and spoke first with Candy, and then with Beth, who sounded well, and with the good news that all her tests had come back fine. This means she didn't have a heart attack,  but her loud snoring during her night at the hospital brought her sleep apnea to the attention of the staff, who strongly recommended that she get her sleeping mask asap. She promised she would. </p>
<p>Paul had joined Beth, Candy, and Rick for lunch at The Mandarin Buffet, after his chemotherapy session today. Gerry and Lionel were there with Tanner as well,  so they all had a good time out together. </p>
<p>Bryn rang through on Skype just as I was wondering if we were going to hear from him today, and it was such a pleasure to get the latest news on Riku right from him ... he may be released from the hospital tomorrow(!), his fever is down, and he is having another blood test tomorrow. Poor wee guy; those needles are no fun at all and I hate to think of him having to get another one done. </p>
<p>Mirei was so happy to not only talk to her Grandpa, Auntie Gail, and Nana, but to see them too! She wanted to talk to Tom as well but he had gone to bed. It was quite late for us to be up, but well worth being able to chat with Mirei, hear her sing a Japanese song to us, and entertain us with her energy and sheer happiness.</p>
<p>I stayed up until just past midnight, having some quiet time to talk to her too, before we said goodbye. She told me several times she wanted to come to my house, and to come to play there, and how I wish she could come sooner too, rather than later ... but very grateful that I am going to see her before November! </p>
<p>Bed time at 12:30 A.M., feeling much much more ready for sleep tonight, with both Beth and Riku on the mend. </p>
