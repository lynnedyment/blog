								<h2>Bryn and Riku Arrive!</h2>
								<p>Today is my birthday, but I must say that the anticipation of this 64th celebration took second place to the arrival of Bryn and Riku today. I've decided that I can't possibly put all the photos I want to from today in one blog, so I am going to do two instead. First, my day with Riku. </p>
<p>We were at the gate when Riku came barreling towards us, with a grinning Bryn right behind him. I got a great running-to-me big hug and such wonderful smiles from Riku, and then Doug lifted this boy up and got a big hug too. Doug asked him about the flight while he was holding him, and we admired how their shirts matched.</p>
<p>I sat in the back seat with Riku going home, and we held hands all the way. They had a great flight; Riku slept about four hours while Bryn thought he napped for only forty minutes, not feeling tired on this trip at alll. </p>
<p>Riku chattered away telling me all about the movie he saw in great detail, and of how he tried hard to sleep, but couldn't, but then finally did, etc. etc. He was so excited as we pulled into the driveway; he of course noticed and admired the pots of flowers on the landing, and made himself at home immediately. The minute he stepped into the room where he sleeps he realized he had forgotten to bring his little golden yellow dog, Skippy, with him. </p>
<p>Riku is a little slimmer but mostly I noticed how pale he is, but of course he had a long day behind him as well as his stint in the hospital last week. The first thing Riku did was unpack his heavily loaded back pack, show me all his goodies, and then wanted to spend some time in the garden, watering plants and just fooling around with the hose. While he was busy with that, I got his clothes unpacked and put away, and then made him eggs, "bacon", and sourdough toast ... all his favourite breakfast foods when he is here. He made some sweet comment to Bryn about how Nana makes special treats. </p>
<p>After eating, Riku spend a very long time at the table making me a birthday card. I provided him with the supplies — blank card, stickers, and a big box of pencil crayons — and  then had to keep my eyes averted each time I walked by, as it was to be a surprise for later today. </p>
<p>After finishing it up, and sealing it, he was quite happy puttering about the house, inspecting all the containers on "his" desk, checking out the familiar things in his room, etc. I had wanted to pick up some fresh fruit earlier in the day, but hadn't, so we all set off in the car together. Riku and I got dropped off at the playground on 23rd and Folsom, near their "old" house, while  Bryn and Doug going on to the grocery store and to the bank. Riku was very happy to see that building where he used to live. </p>
<p>The playground wasn't too busy, and Riku seemed happy to just meander about, climb the dome about halfway, and walk the tightrope. Long past the sitting in the sandbox stage, he chose instead to jump through it and across it in one step. He was having such fun in that sandbox, fooling around and just enjoying being off that plane, I'm sure, and out in the fresh air. At one point he spent a lot of time balancing on the sloping edge of the long sandbox, asking me to join him. Soon however, a friendly five-year-old boy started to interact with Riku, calling him by name, and before I knew it they were running off playing hide and seek together, chasing each other, and both climbing the dome as far as Riku has ever climbed before. </p>
<p>Bryn and Doug picked us up at about 5:30 and I shall continue on with the rest of my day in blog number two. </p>
