								<h2>Riku's Long Visit with Kai</h2>
								<p>Riku was anxious to have a playdate with Kai today, a classmate from his Japanese nursery school program. I called while Riku was having breakfast and Kai's dad said it worked out fine for them, as Kai starts in at a summer camp program next week. I am so pleased I called, as this might be the one last week day these two have together. </p>
<p>Riku and I walked over to Kai's house at 10:30 (and how sweet it was to see them walking hand in hand for part of the trip home) and the two boys were together until we met up with Kai's dad and little sister at 3:30 at yet another playground. </p>
<p>What fun they had in between those hours; they got along so very well, happily going from one project to another here at the house. They started off by building a playground and log cabin with the log set, and Riku called on Doug at one point to help out with the roof. They spent a long long time in the garden, mostly digging in the dirt trying to find bugs. How I wish I could just rent lots of interesting bugs for the next month, as the occasional spider and a few pill bugs aren't very exciting. They certainly persevered though. </p>
<p>They had a good lunch together, sitting chatting at the table over their grilled cheese sandwiches, as requested, and a plate with cherries, carrot sticks, and a mandarin orange each. Later they snacked on cheese, cookies, and nuts, and lots of apple juice and water after their time in the garden. </p>
<p>We walked over to what Riku calls "Kai's playground", as it is just a block away from Kai's house. The playground on 23rd is "Riku's playground", and the one at the top of the hill here, which we haven't yet been to on this visit, is known as "Nana's playground". So far, the one we went to yesterday is being referred to as "the new playground", although that might change as we discover new ones. </p>
<p>The boys had a great time together while we waited for Kai's dad to arrive. They each had a Frisbee with them, and as it was quite windy they were running after them following each and every throw ... from the tops of the slides, across the grassy area, and onto the play area when there weren't too many children around. </p>
<p>Riku was delighted to see Kei's adorable one-and-a-half-year-old sister, Evi. She reminds me a lot of Mirei, as she is determined and fearless and independent. Riku followed her everywhere, pushed her on the swing, made sure she was safe on the round-about, took her hand when she let him, and gave her a hug and kiss goodbye when we left them at 3:45 P.M.</p>
<p>Bryn went off to a movie this afternoon, and he and Riku left for a visit and dinner at Susan's and Kevin's, joining another friend of Amelia's,  as well as a friend of Susan's, her two children, and a friend of the friend too. It was a busy fun night for them all; they arrived home at 8:30. </p>
<p>Doug and I had watched a movie so that we can order "Spiderman" for Riku from Netflix. He is quite keen to watch it, so we had to send one off for this to happen. It forced me to just put my feet up and relax and not sit at the computer trying to catch up, a hopeless task at this stage. </p>
<p>Riku wanted dessert when he got home, and by the time he had that, and talked about his visit, and asked about plans for tomorrow, and the usual bedtime routine, it was 9:30 when I closed his door. He was asleep again tonight in about three minutes! I think his dad was, too, as he had been working in the bedroom, and I didn't hear a peep out of him. I turned off his light and shut his door at 11 o'clock when I headed up to bed myself.</p>
