								<h2>Murphys and Angels Camp</h2>
								<p>We set off at 9:30 this morning, heading almost due east, to Murphys, California, a small town of about 2,000 people. It was in its heyday in the late 1850s and was one of the famous gold mining towns. The population back then was about 3,000, and unlike most mining towns it remained a viable place to live and visit because of the mountain scenery and the nearby caverns. </p>
<p>The temperature was to be 89F today, and even though it was a hot day for sure, it didn't feel that hot to us. Doug and Tom found it hotter seated in the front seat, but Gail and I were perfectly comfortable. The first part of our trip was on the highway but the last half was on a smaller two lane road, and we enjoyed the country scenery all the way to Murphys. </p>
<p>It was time for lunch when we arrived, and we walked from one end to the other to check out our choices, settling on a small bakery/sandwich shop. The food was delicious; Doug and I had tuna on cornmeal bread, Gail had a veggie sandwich on cornmeal, and Tom had a turkey sandwich on focaccia. For a dollar extra it came with a small portion of tasty potato salad, two strawberries, and a few thick potato chips ... an overabundance of potatoes, for sure! </p>
<p>However, over the next two hours we walked it off. First stop was the local pokey, where Doug and Tom posed for us at the door. It really was the local spot for bad guys at one point, so was very interesting for sure. We took lots of photos of the lovely old stone and frame buildings, built in the 1860s onward. The local church was built the same year as the saloon, and Murphys Hotel had many interesting visitors in those days: Ulysses S. Grant, Mark Twain (aka Samuel Clemens), Bret Harte (an author), Thomas Lipton (of Lipton tea), J.P. Morgan, and John Jacob Astor of the Astor family. There was a plumbing store featuring antique parts for bathrooms, kitchens, and the home in general, and Doug found three old keys from Britain that he always keeps an eye out for. He was very pleased with his purchase. </p>
<p>Toronto had moose, painted up and placed around the city, Nanaimo had painted whales last year, and Murphys has frogs with gold pans (because of Mark Twain's famous story, "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County"). I couldn't resist taking a photo of one of them. </p>
<p>We stopped in at a candy store before leaving, and everyone bought a treat... Gail and I got a bag each of wonderfully tasty coconut brittle, Doug bought peanut brittle and caramel, and Tom bought chocolate with chili oil. </p>
<p>Angels Camp, less than half an hour away, was our next stop, another gold mining town that survived after the miners had left. Angels Camp is 50% larger than Murphys, so we found it odd that a huge percentage of its stores were closed at 4 o'clock on a Friday afternoon. Gail and I were more than ready for our tea, and we found the perfect spot, a large airy non-profit business, with lots of food and beverage choices. The woman who served us was very friendly; the tea came in a lovely little pot that kept the tea very hot, and kept us supplied with lots of hot water and milk. Tom and Doug wandered around the store/cafe looking at all the goods brought in from other countries.  </p>
<p>We decided to stop for dinner on the way home, and ended up at "Mimi's" in Dublin. Gail and I shared a huge portion of fish and chips, perfect for a Friday night, Tom had a pulled pork sandwich on ciabetta, and Doug had barbecued salmon. </p>
<p>Gail and I had our cups of tea at home while playing cards, and then worked on our family tree while Tom and Doug went upstairs to watch a music DVD. That's it! A whole day out of the house today and a new adventure. </p>
