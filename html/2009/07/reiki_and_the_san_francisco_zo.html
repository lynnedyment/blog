								<h2>Reiki and The San Francisco Zoo</h2>
								<p>One of the new doulas at SFGH attended our meeting last month, and invited any of us to call her for a free treatment, as she was going into the business full time, and wanted to work on some people other than her friends. Surprisingly to me, I was the only one who took her up on her offer, and today was the day! She arrived at 10 o'clock with her brand new folding table, and we set it up in our bedroom upstairs, removing the phone first. Quiet music was playing in the background ... soothing ringing tones from a Tibetan singing bowl, a small eye pad over my eyes, and had a "bed buddy" on my tummy for the first half hour. Ahhhhhh!  An hour and twenty minutes later we emerged, with me feeling very relaxed and cozy. I would be very happy to have this kind of treatment again, as it was my first one, but with luck, not my last. My chakras are happy! </p>
<p>Gail was busy in the garden, pulling up some very tough and aggressive ivy.from the side of the garden fence. I went out and worked with her for a bit, and then went in to make lunch for Gail and me, and Doug made up his own specialty for him and Tom ... a tuna Thai dish with brown rice. </p>
<p>And then it was off to the zoo! Neither Tom nor Gail had been to our zoo before, and we had a great day for it. It's often too cool over in that part of the city, but today we had sun and warmer temps, although Gail and I both bundle up more than others. Interesting doing the zoo with adults as we covered the entire zoo, seeing all but two small exhibits, in just three hours. We saw the baby gorilla in a little nest before the mother came to carry her away for a "walk", admired the giraffes, checked out the lions and the bears, visited the insect house, and saw some tiny almost newborn monkeys too. </p>
<p>We made a stop at Rainbow on the way home for some fresh produce, and then it was time for a warm Acme cinnamon sticky bun for all of us, and big cups of hot milky tea for Gail and me, and cards, of course! </p>
<p>Doug went off to his class, Gail and I had some family tree and email time using both computers, and we all ate dinner together after Doug got home at 7:30. Our usual evening followed: Doug and Tom upstairs watching a music video, Gail and I doing a little tree work, then me getting busy with my blog photos while Gail read. About 10 o'clock I started showing Gail some videos of the children, from last October; Tom and Doug joined us at some point and we all watched the singing/building/piano-music videos until 11 P.M.! Bedtime for all after that entertainment. More to come at some point.   </p>
