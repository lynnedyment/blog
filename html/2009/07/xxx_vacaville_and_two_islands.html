								<h2>Vacaville ... and Two Islands Too!</h2>
								<p>Gail and Tom always enjoy a trip to Vacaville when they are in town visiting, and we are happy for the excuse to go too, as we never go on our own anymore. It was quite cool when we left, with a heavy fog hanging over the city, but of course the sun was shining and it was very warm with a nice breeze fifty minutes away from the city. No doubt it warmed up there too, but Gail and I both snuggled up in our jackets until we arrived.  </p>
<p>Gail was looking for slacks and I wanted to buy some cards. I ended up with a bright orange blouse as well as the cards, Tom bought lots of goodies at Harry and David's, Doug stocked up on Jelly Bellys and salsa, and we all bought something at the Jockey Outlet store. I had hoped to do some early birthday shopping for Kelly, but had no luck at all. </p>
<p>We stopped for lunch at Fresh Choice, another favourite of Gail's and Tom's, and our usual lunch spot when we are in Vacaville. I heaped up my plate with salad, as I always do, barely having enough room for the small baked potato with all the fixings I enjoy so much. Gail, Tom, and Doug all saved themselves for caramel sauce with a token amount of soft ice cream, and Tom topped his off with some sundae fixings. We all enjoyed the tiny delicious muffins too: corn meal for Tom, Gail, and me, and blueberry for Doug.  </p>
<p>Gail managed to find her slacks and was a happy girl with all her purchases, and I was very happy to find a long lovely lightweight white and blue scarf to snug on over a sweater on our cool summer mornings. </p>
<p>We left about 3:30 P.M. and lucked out with traffic on the way home. We made such good time that we decided to take a drive through Treasure Island, and Yerba Buena Island, two places halfway across the Bay Bridge that in over the twenty years that we have lived here, we have never visited. It was interesting, if still somewhat mysterious. Yerba Buena is essentially one big hill, so visiting it essentially means driving around its base, and seeing very little other than treed hillside (the Coast Guard uses this as a base, but that part of it is closed to the public). Treasure Island, which is entirely reclaimed land (thus flat as a pancake), a former naval base, and the original home of the <a href="http://www.sfmuseum.org/photos2/clipper.html"><u>Pan Am Clippers</u></a>, is now a somewhat mysterious place. Aside from things like a water treatment plant, and many large building of unspecified purpose (although the movie industry is known to use several of them), it's pretty empty except for the western end, where the old barracks buildings have been maintained in very nice shape, and seem to be be filled with people (although we mostly saw their cars, largely pretty upscale models). The island also affords some great views of the Bay Bridge and the city, though it was pretty windy for picture taking. I thought Doug was going to blow away from his perch on the rock while doing so! </p>
<p>Quiet evening at home. No one was hungry after our big lunch, so Gail and I had a fruit bowl, Tom had sourdough toast, and Doug had both. Tom and Doug went up to watch a music video so Gail and I had some time for our family tree, one on each computer. That's it! </p>
