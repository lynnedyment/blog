								<h2>A Very Busy Day at Home For the Girls</h2>
								<p>After a long day out yesterday, Gail and I decided we would stay home and get through some of the chores on our "to do" list. But before we tackled the upstairs work, we took out all the fruits and veggies we bought yesterday, and set to work making a huge fresh fruit salad, Greek salad, and tabbouleh. We worked together, chopping, mincing, pitting, slicing, etc. and two hours flew by. I am so sorry I didn't take a photo of our finished dishes, as they all looked and smelled wonderful! </p>
<p>We had lunch with Tom and Doug, and they set off to visit the Colma Cemetery to find Wyatt Earp's final resting place. He's not related so Gail and I decided to let them go on their own. They had a great time exploring and took a few photos, including the dome-roofed mausoleum housing the remains of Levi Strauss and family; one of the nearby headstones gave them a chuckle, as the cross piece in the "G" had worn away, making the inscription read that the poor woman was sleeping with the fishes! Some thoughtful folks had left some presents for Wyatt, among them stones, coins, and a wee dram of whiskey. </p>
<p>They had some other errands to run too, so we settled in for an hour or so of family tree work again, before going up to tackle the huge number of bags of children's clothes to be sorted. This is a job I have put off for a long long time, as it is overwhelming ... what to give away, what to keep for babies, children, in the future, with my doula moms, what clothes of my grandchildren's to retain for them to have one day for keepsakes, and what to give to charity. So many piles, so many memories, so many decisions to make ... it's tough for me. </p>
<p>However, Gail got at my backlog of ironing, we put on some taped Oprahs, and while I sorted and made those decisions, with Gail urging me to get rid of more than I might have without her, we did very well. Gail finds ironing relaxing (not a word I would choose for that particular job) and I was happy to get at this long put-off chore of mine. We did very well, and by the end of three solid hours the ironing was almost done (we did take a short break once or twice, putting our feet up), and I had made significant inroads into the grand giveaway! </p>
<p>Tom and Doug had stopped on their way home to pick up a fresh pineapple for our fruit salad, so we got that prepared and the table set, with time for a quick game of cards before they came back from picking up our pizza from "Little Star", Gail's favourite pizza ever(!) and certainly one of our top three in the area. </p>
<p>We spent our evening in the usual way, although Gail and Tom went to bed earlier tonight, Doug followed not much later, and even though my intention was to go upstairs and read in bed, I didn't turn out my light until 1 A.M. </p>
<p>Oh, I took a photo of all of our wonderful produce purchases at Webb Ranch before we started eating it all. </p>
