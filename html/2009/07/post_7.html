								<h2>Nanaimo, B.C. to Grants Pass, Oregon</h2>
								<p>Gail was up packing sandwiches and snacks for our trip when I got up to shower this morning, and less than an hour later we were lined up for our 7:40 ferry trip. Doug had eaten his usual breakfast, so went off to read the local papers while Gail and Tom treated me to an egg, hash browns, toast, and tea breakfast. After Tom left to join Doug in the seats, Gail and I had more tea with our usual three hands of cards. A gal Gail had worked with, who is still working on the ferry, kindly took a photo of us outside on the deck of the ferry. We said goodbye to them, with big hugs and many thanks when we docked, and Doug and I were off on our way home. </p>
<p>We went through a smaller border crossing, and heard on our way there that there was an hour and a half wait at the Peace Arch. We didn't mind our quick half-hour wait at all! The day was still cool at this point, and we enjoyed our drive through Washington State, stopping at a Safeway store for the cheapest gas of the trip. It was advertised at $2.66 per gallon, with a three cent discount if you had a Safeway card, which we do, but Doug said somehow he ended up paying just $2.55! We went into the store and bought Bing cherries, almost as good as the B.C. cherries, but paid only 99¢ a pound.</p>
<p>We ate our yummy sandwiches for lunch in the car ... lentil loaf for Doug and tuna for me on the small whole wheat buns Gail bought at Coombs on Thursday. </p>
<p>"Yum Yum", the café in Eugene, Oregon, where we had stopped in on the way to Nanaimo, was our choice for dinner again today. We both ended up ordering exactly what we had the last time, but I took photos of the meals today. I had more tofu in my dish, which was just fine with me! We worked on a sudoku puzzle while I finished up my tea. We also stopped into an Old Navy to check out the sales, and found a cute very lightweight blue checked blouse for me ($15) and a red Transformer t-shirt for Riku for just $10.</p>
<p>We made very good time all day, with light traffic but by the time we were in southern Oregon, the day was heating up and it wasn't very comfortable. We drove a little longer than I would have liked, but made it to within an hour of the California border at Grants Pass. There was a huge Motel 6 there, but with only one "smoking room" left; there were lots of loud parties going on so I was very happy to hear they couldn't accommodate us. We drove to another privately owned motel but it was a little pricey for what it was, so on we went to get the last queen non-smoking room at a Super Eight Motel instead. The price included a continental breakfast too, and the room was large and airy with a good Internet connection. </p>
<p>Doug turned the AC on high and checked his messages, while I took a quick shower and lounged on the bed. I was tired, but wanted to see if there was any word about Riku from Bryn, and there was, but it was worrisome. He sent a link to the name of the infection Riku has/had and Doug and I clicked through several different connections on the link to see the cause and result. Thank goodness I knew that Riku was on the mend, because reading about it was scary. A large number of young children die from it ... and some are deaf as a result of it. It was especially strange as all Riku's immunizations are up to date. I am so glad to know that Riku's fever has gone, and that he might be out of the hospital very soon. </p>
<p>There was a beautiful sliver of a moon in the sky the last hour or so of our drive. Riku and I had made a pact that when we missed each other we would look up into the sky, day or night, and think about each other. That little boy was on my mind all night. </p>
