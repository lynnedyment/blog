								<h2>Gail and Tom Arrive!</h2>
								<p>Doug went off at 7:30 this morning to pick Gail and Tom up at the train station in Emeryville. It was due in at 8:10 and was on time, much to our surprise, as Amtrak has a reputation for being late. I was home showering, and doing a little vacuuming, just on this one floor. </p>
<p>The flowers Susan had planted are now in full bloom, and they make the front of the house look so much brighter! </p>
<p>There is a huge stack of weeds, sticks, and random garden debris in the back yard from all the clean up yesterday, so I pointed out to Gail what was ahead of us before next Wednesday night. Gail brought new gardening gloves with her for both of us, all set for this outdoor work she had promised to help me with. Lucky me! (I must say it doesn't look very large in the photo, but believe me, it is, and I'm sure we are going to need two weeks to get rid of it in the large compost bins the city provides for us. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom were happy to be here, but both looked so tired. They hadn't slept well in what Tom described as their sardine-tin "bedroom". Gail unpacked right away, and then the two of us went off to Rainbow and Safeway for groceries, as I had no sourdough bread in the house for our breakfast tomorrow. I had delayed getting groceries, and must say it was more fun grocery shopping with Gail for company. Usually Doug picks up any groceries we need on his way home from his T'ai Chi class. </p>
<p>Doug and Tom had just finished up their lunch when we walked in, and Gail and I were more than ready for ours! We had a yummy thick sandwich with all the fixings, and finished off with big cups of hot tea and two games of cards. We chatted the afternoon away, and the time flew by. </p>
<p>Soon it was time for Doug to leave for his class; he came home just as his corn on the cob was ready, and had a veggie burger as Tom had. Gail and I had big spinach salads as neither of us was hungry after our big lunch. That was a quick and easy dinner! </p>
<p>Tom read in the living room for a long time, Doug was busy setting up a second monitor, Gail read a bit after our after-dinner tea and card games, and I got some photo work done on the computer. Tom headed for bed at 9, while Gail somehow managed to stay up for another half hour or so, before going to bed to read. Doug went up ahead of me, as I was doing a little family tree work. Lazy, relaxed day all 'round! </p>
