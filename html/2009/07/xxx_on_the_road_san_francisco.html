								<h2>On the Road ... San Francisco, California,  to Corvallis, Oregon</h2>
								<p>I stayed up much too late last night, trying to write as many catch-up emails as possible, and get some e-cards ready to be sent out. It all took so much longer than I hoped it would, and the morning came too early. Of course Gail was already up, and everyone was busy getting all the little last-minute jobs done before leaving the house. We left twenty minutes later than we had planned to, at 9:20 A.M., but nothing was forgotten, including watering all the flowers on the front steps, the last chore I had on my list. </p>
<p>I was happy to sit in the back seat of the car, relaxing with Gail, knowing there wasn't another thing to do but relax, read, doze, enjoy the scenery, and help decide what to eat where, and when! It was cool when we left the city but of course it soon warmed up. We were well supplied with cold water bottles in a small cooler in the back seat with us, which — covered with a soft blanket to keep it as cool as possible — also gave us a good arm rest. </p>
<p>The time passed quickly; I caught up on a few newspapers, Gail read a novel set in Liverpool she is going to pass on to me, and I dozed on and off more frequently than I had intended to. We hoped to make good time today and rather than get off the main highway for lunch, we opted for a quicker stop at a "Taco Bell", and I must say it hit the spot. Gail and I both had seven layer burritos, and then decided we were hungry enough for a small cheese and bean burrito as well. We had only a banana for breakfast before leaving, so I wasn't surprised we were hungry. Gail bought an icy pineapple coconut drink to share too, which was so cold it gave us both "ice cream headaches"! Tom and Doug had the seven layer burrito as well as another smaller burrito. </p>
<p>Back on the road, I started working on some sudoku puzzles, and actually managed to finish two of them on my own, making that three in total! I'm slowly working away at them, and enjoy the challenge, but I am much better at crossword puzzles! </p>
<p>We stopped for gas, and bathroom breaks, and stopped at the same lovely rest stop where Bryn and Doug slept in a van, many many years ago, on their way to California from West Vancouver. And many years after that we stopped there with a very young Riku, a mere nine months old, so he could nurse, sit in the cool grass, and look at the cool running river at the back of that area. Lots of good memories here, and Gail and Tom have stopped here as well on their various trips to California from Nanaimo. </p>
<p>We lucked out for dinner, as "Maggie", our GPS gal, had led us to a vegetarian restaurant in Eugene, where we had decided would be our dinner stop. It was called "Yum Yum's", and was in a really lovely huge outdoor mall, with lots of upscale restaurants, a group of young people playing in a band on a central entertainment area, and many independent and interesting shops. We all had a hard time deciding what to eat as there were so many great choices. It didn't help that we were hungrier than usual either! </p>
<p>I was so happy with my large organic green salad with bite-sized chunks of grilled tofu, and a really delicious Asian-style dressing. Gail thoroughly enjoyed her veggie burger, Tom had a "bowl" which was really quite small, and probably not as much as he needed after our long break between meals, and Doug thought he had picked the perfect meal for him too: a "wrap" with lots of his favourite things. Happy travellers were we! </p>
<p>We had decided at some point in the afternoon that we would stop for the night in Corvallis, Oregon, and we made such good time that it was easy to do this. Traffic was light and we got to our Motel 6 at about 8 P.M. We should have just checked into our room then, but Gail and I thought a hot cup of tea and a game of cards in the room would be the perfect end to our day, and Tom was looking for a magazine to read. We had no luck finding an open Starbucks for our tea, and went to two different places we were told were open. One of them was in a Safeway store so I bought some delicious Bing cherries for the car trip tomorrow, and of the three places we tried for Tom's magazine, not one had what he wanted. Our very last stop was at a huge empty "Taco Time"  for tea, perhaps the only place open in this area after 7 P.M., and what a riot this was. I asked the young gal at the service counter for the largest cup of tea they had, and was nearly bowled over when she gave me two <strong>massive</strong> plastic cups of really hot tea, so hot I couldn't pick them up. She double cupped them for me, and how my fellow passengers laughed at me when I walked out to the car with them. The photos tell the story. </p>
<p>Doug checked his email in our room, although the connection was not a strong one, and he didn't get very far with it. I had gone into Gail and Tom's room to play cards and drink that tea, determined to finish it after all the trouble Doug had gone to, finding it for us! Tom walked out to two different stores, quite a distance away, still seeking a magazine, but came back empty-handed. </p>
<p>I was so sorry I hadn't taken a photo of our very well packed car, or of us at the rest stop, but it was so hot travelling through northern California and into Oregon that it just never occured to me until it was too late. </p>
<p>Bed time at 11 P.M. for four car-weary travellers. </p>
