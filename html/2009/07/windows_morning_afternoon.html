								<h2>Windows, a Morning Out, and an Afternoon at Home</h2>
								<p>Gail and I were sitting having our tea, and playing cards, when we both commented on how dirty the windows were at the top and back of our eating area. I used to have them washed professionally, but that was too long ago, and so today was the day to get at them ourselves! Doug bought new nozzles for the hose just before we went to PEI, and Gail was more than happy to use the most powerful nozzle to get most of the debris and dirt off the sun roof area of the windows. She did a great job, and then tackled the outside of the French doors and side windows. Gail was not quite tall enough to reach the very top of the inside of the tallest windows, so Doug came and together they got the windows spic and span! </p>
<p>I was admiring them as I tackled smaller jobs that needed doing in the kitchen and dining room. We made great progress this morning, in a very short time period! Having a cleaning crew sure does make a difference! </p>
<p>By 10:30, Gail and I were at my hairdresser's in Noe Valley. Gail was willing to stay home and continue working, but it is such a treat to have someone with me in this city, and it didn't take much to talk her into joining me. I hadn't had my hair cut since the week before I went to Japan in early April, the longest I've gone without a cut in a long time. Three days ago it looked just great, and the next day it was driving me crazy! </p>
<p>Bing, the gal who cuts my hair, also "does" brows, and since both Gail and I were overdue for some brow shaping, we decided to get this done while we were there. Neatly trimmed, we stopped in at my favourite Thai restaurant in Noe Valley for a take-away lunch of "crispy tofu" with peanut sauce, and a shared dish of sauteed tofu with mixed vegetables. It has been about three years since I have been there &mdash; far too long! &mdash; and it was lovely to reconnect with the owner who recognized me from all the years before that I have eaten there. We both stated that the other looked just great, and agreed that life was good for both of us. When Doug was travelling so much, I often stopped in for take-away for my dinner, and Kelly more than once treated me to that wonderful food when she was in town with the children. Lots of good memories of good food and service. </p>
<p>Doug and Tom were just preparing their lunches when we got home, in anticipation of a movie this afternoon, receiving great reviews, called "The Hurt Locker" about a bomb unit in Iraq. </p>
<p>After enjoying our tasty lunch, along with the inevitable tea and card game, Gail and I continued cleaning the debris from the back garden. I have been asking neighbours if we could fill up their composting containers, and so we were determined to bag up as much as we possibly could before having it out on the curb tomorrow night. It is all looking soooo good! Doug kept stepping into the bin for us, and more and more needles got packed in. We have been breaking up or cutting the longer pieces of dried wood to make even more room, and it's amazing how much we finally managed to gather up. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug ran some errands for us, dropping off clothes to both the Salvation Army and to the Homeless Prenatal Shelter, and stopped in for a few Bob's doughnuts, on Tom's "to-do" list. Not long after arriving home, back out they went to pick up a pizza from "Tomasso's" pizzeria in North Beach. This was also on Gail and Tom's to-do list, but since we are running out of time, and getting so much done in the house, we decided take-out from there tonight would be just fine. We also had corn on the cob, as Doug had picked some up on his grocery run last night. Dessert was divine: coconut macaroons from Bob's, a treat from our husbands for us, and which we topped with coconut ice cream. Was that good! </p>
<p>Gail and Tom sat in the living room reading after Tom and Doug had watched another music video, and I answered some emails. I had just found out this morning that Bryn and Riku would be arriving in San Francisco on my birthday (!), and so it was time to book Caillie's flight here, and my flight to Toronto with her, and then back for October. </p>
<p>I had a little trouble deciding just exactly how long to stay in Ontario!  I wanted as much time with Uncle Frank as I could manage, so Doug had come close to booking three different flights for me, as I changed my mind for various reasons. I'm sure it was frustrating for him! </p>
<p>Just as the final decision had been made, and a click away from booking it for the 3rd of October, Bryn popped up on IM. Thank goodness it wasn't a minute later, as he reminded me that Mirei was going to be arriving with him October the 1st! How I had let this slip my mind is beyond me; I must have been awfully tired when he first told me about this on IM some time ago, but it was "stop the presses!" time for sure. Doug had to start the whole booking business over again, and it was quite late before it all was settled. </p>
<p>I was happy to finally be able to drop a note to Kelly and Caillie with the times for Caillie's trip here. I am so pleased it all worked out so well, as we will have time with Riku on his own at the beginning of his trip, and then time with Caillie on her own, at the end of hers. </p>
<p>Too late once more, I headed off to bed. I might just sleep all the way to B.C. starting on Friday! </p>
<p>p.s. It was such a busy day that I didn't even think to take photos ... so have just this one. </p>
