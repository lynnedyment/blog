								<h2>Finn, Garden Clean-Up, and a Long Walk Across the Golden Gate Bridge</h2>
								<p>Finn rang the doorbell this morning, greeting me with his usual big smile! Susan and I stood chatting at the front door for a few minutes before she left to run errands, and Finn was very surprised to see new faces upstairs at our house! The minute he spotted Gail in the garden he covered his face with his hands, I guess assuming that if he couldn't see her, he too was invisible. She just talked quietly to him, and after becoming invisible just one more time, he got interested in the gardening she was doing. Gail is determined to get the rest of the garden, started so well by Susan and family, finished off before she leaves, so today she got at it. Doug and Tom had picked up a proper shrub rake yesterday, so she got to give up using the children's garden tools today ... a big improvement! </p>
<p>Doug found a tiny spider in the house just before he went up to shower, and placed it in a small glass for Finn to see. He was very interested, of course, and after inspecting it, watched as Doug set it loose in the garden. </p>
<p>Finn usually spends most of his time outside when he comes over on warm days, but today he was feeling domestic and worked away at cutting vegetables and fruit from the kitchen area with a cutting board and a knife helping him with the job. He was very serious about it, and it was fun snapping photos as he worked away. </p>
<p>After he ate his usual bowl of porridge "yes, with stawberry", around 11 A.M., I decided to get out the container of "diamond sand", a clay-like substance that all the children love playing with. Finn has played with it at the Bay Area Discovery Museum, but never at Nana's house, so he was happy to sit there working away with the dump truck and the little digger, and knocking down the tiny "castles" I built up with a small cup. As always, our time together passed quickly. Susan came in just after the noon hour bearing a box of luscious pastries. Gail had been reading in the living room with Tom, and once we said goodbye to Susan and Finn, she and I shared a yummy cream cheese and fruit pastry, before lunch! </p>
<p>It was a gorgeous sunny day with blue clear skies, so we decided it was the perfect day to walk the Golden Gate Bridge. Right after a quick lunch, we drove, parked, and walked up the steep, but now paved steps from the Fort Point area to the bridge itself. We could not have picked a better day for this, as it wasn't too windy, as it often is, it wasn't too cold, as it often is, and Gail and Tom took lots of photos. This was Tom's first time walking the bridge and we all enjoyed the hour and a half round trip. </p>
<p>We got home with time to spare before Doug went off to his class; we decided to have dinner together when Doug got home, so Gail finished off the last of the ironing, while I did a bit more sorting of the toys to give away. </p>
<p>Gail and I sat and played cards after dinner, pretty tuckered out from a really productive busy day, and the tea tasted especially good tonight. I answered emails, while Gail sat with Tom, reading. Early night for everyone but me ... I'm tired, but have trouble giving up that time at the computer at the end of these long busy days! </p>
