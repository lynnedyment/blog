								<h2>The Entire Doering/Ellis Gardening Crew Arrives!</h2>
								<p>Kevin has the week off work and Susan had suggested they all come over today and work in the garden with me. However, since "the parents" rarely have any alone time together, I urged her to drop the children off and for the two of them to go out for brunch, or a walk, or whatever. After thinking about it for a couple of minutes, Susan said she would take me up on it after all, as a friend in Alaska had suggested they check out a caf√© on on Folsom Street, I believe. This worked out beautifully for all of us. </p>
<p>The children had some free play time at the house, before they started "working", and both got on the little vehicles in the garden, with Finn following Amelia everywhere she went on the trike. She moved to the little wooden deck, and Finn picked up his push car and followed her there. They did have fun bumping into each other! </p>
<p>Finally Amelia decided to start trimming the plants, which of course meant that Finn wanted to use the shears. To distract him, I suggested he put some peanuts out for the blue jay. When he did manage to get hold of the shears, he sat down and took his time crushing the peanuts up into bits, and with my permission even ate a few of them. We were all clicking away up into the trees, and were successful in drawing the blue jay to carefully swoop down to peck away and carry off a peanut bit. He doesn't always come around when we call, so we were delighted with his appearance today. </p>
<p>Both children were ready for some porridge with blueberries about 11 o'clock, so we decided to go upstairs to eat while Amelia watched one episode of "Casper, the Friendly Ghost". I fed Finn while he played happily with Bryn's Fisher-Price farm, bought when Bryn was two years old... 39 years ago! When he opened the left hand door and heard the cow mooing, he leaned way in and said "Where is it?" Amelia went over and explained it to him, but he never did give up on trying to spot that elusive cow! </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin arrived not much later, and since they never arrive empty-handed, we all sat at the table and enjoyed fresh "Goat Hill" pizza for lunch and a sweet yellow watermelon for dessert. Delicious! I could not believe how much of that pizza Finn ate, as he had finished an entire bowl of cereal not an hour beforehand.</p>
<p>After lunch we all got right to work. Susan did lots of clipping, making a huge inroad into the overgrowth of persistent ivy and asparagus fern, Kevin made sure Finn didn't fall down the steep steps at the side of the house, and helped Amelia in her little corner, where she was trying hard to match the huge pile of debris we hadn't been able to put in the compost bin last night. I weeded and swept, and took a few photos of it all too. The pile has grown higher and higher today.The garden looks so so much better, and it's all thanks to Susan and her hard work and enthusiasm, and her great crew of willing helpers! </p>
<p>p.s. Before leaving, Finn found the box of necklaces in the toy basket, and put on as many as he could before it was time to leave. </p>
<p>p.p.s. Not long after they left, Susan sent me a sweet photo from her iPhone. Yes, they worked hard! </p>
