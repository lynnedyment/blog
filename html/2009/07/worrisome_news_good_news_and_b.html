								<h2>Worrisome News, Good News ... and Birthday Treats, Too</h2>
								<p>I  woke at 7:45 today, walked into the computer room to hear from Gail that Riku is in the hospital in Japan. He awoke with a high fever, went to the doctor's, and was sent to the hospital to be admitted. Bryn filled me in not much later via IM. Riku had been in for ten hours at this point, with an infection of unknown origin. He has had blood work done, and been hooked up to IV, with antibiotics being given three times a day. The doctor has told them he could be in for as long as a week, although the night nurse told Akane that she thinks he won't be in that long. He and Bryn are scheduled to leave for San Francisco in eight days, and I just want him to be well and healthy when he is on that plane. Now we wait for more news on the situation, as I am writing this fourteen hours later. </p>
<p>Bryn did pass on some happy news about Mirei. She "loved, loved, loved" her short term at the Japanese nursery school she went to for a few weeks after her French Immersion program ended for the summer, and Akane said her Japanese language skills are just astounding as a result. Today she conquered the letter C which surprised me to hear had been a little puzzling for her, as she was printing R, E, and M when I was in Japan in April. She and Bryn made a get well card for Riku, and I imagine they are at the hospital now with him. How I wish I were too! </p>
<p>And we were worried about Beth too, as she was in the hospital overnight. And just as she hoped, she was released today, although Candy wrote to say she checked herself out without waiting to see her doctor. We checked emails throughout the day for any more news on Beth or Riku, but heard nothing more. Beth was waiting to hear from the sleep disorder clinic, though, as she has sleep apnea and has done nothing about it for far too long. Candy will get tough with her about this for sure! </p>
<p>Gail was treating me to a "tips and toes" manicure and pedicure, side by side, at her favourite salon. We puttered about in the house in the morning, and at 11:30 Tom and Doug dropped us off at Rutherford Mall for lunch. They were going out for lunch and to a bookstore together, while Gail and I went to "Kelsey's" where we were the first customers of the day; we shared a veggie burger, with a bowl of broccoli and cheese soup each to start. It was an hour or so before our 1:30 appointment, so we went looking for a white blouse for Gail, found one at last, and wandered into a huge antique store. If I had the money, and the room(!), I would have been tempted to buy a sweet wooden and wicker doll's rocking chair. </p>
<p>Our treatments lasted for almost two hours of solid pampering. It was wonderful, just having my fingernail's trimmed, the hands lightly scrubbed with a rough lotion, lots of cream, a very light pink polish ... something I never wear on my fingers but didn't resist this time, and then a hand and leg massage, ending with polish on my toes too. We had herbal tea, and I had a cozy blanket on too, as I was a little chilly in the air conditioned room. I came close to dozing off a couple of times, but Riku's little face kept coming to me. I wondered if he cried when the needles went in for the tests and the IV, and how he was sleeping. </p>
<p>It's a hot day, but the house stayed fairly cool with all the fans running and the doors and windows open to catch any breeze. We had a game of cards, had our afternoon tea, checked for emails again (nothing from anyone yet), and left for a birthday dinner treat for Doug from me ... a fish and chips restaurant that was new to both of us. It was just great! It is called the "Fox and Hounds", a British-style pub, that was voted as having the best fish and chips on Vancouver Island. We are sure they are, as the fish (cod, which I am not usually fond of at all) was delicious with not too heavy a batter, the chips and green salad perfect, as were the three desserts we ordered. Gail and I shared a wonderful rice pudding, Doug had bread pudding with hot custard sauce, and Tom a banana and pecan pudding with sauce. While we were waiting for our meals we all sipped at our tall glasses of Harp (Tom), Kinkelly (Gail), Coke (Doug), and a very tasty hard cider for me. </p>
<p>Home to a very hot house about 7:30.  Gail had promised both Tom and Doug that she would make them a cheesecake to have here, so I got busy with that, while Gail searched for my recipe for it. No luck, so we winged it, and I'm sure it will be fine. I made up some tuna for sandwiches tomorrow, Gail washed up the baking dishes, and we finally sat out on the deck where it is definitely cooler than the 86F than in the house! We even played cards out on the table, and didn't have our evening tea. It's just bloody hot here right now and apparently is going to continue for a few days. </p>
<p>Still hoping to hear from Bryn before heading for bed ... </p>
