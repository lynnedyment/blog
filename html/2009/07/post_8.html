								<h2>A New Playground and a Lemon Too!</h2>
								<p>Riku and I made up a list of things he wanted to do on this trip, something Bryn, Caillie, and I always did, and then Myk' and Bryant too. On Riku's list is to visit old and new playgrounds and today he got to cross off two of the as-yet-unknown playgrounds we plan to visit. This was a brand new one for us; a large area between our local Safeway and Akane's old art studio. One of the neighbourhood groups petitioned to have the badly neglected and very old playground replaced, and they managed to get a wonderful one built. Doug had a luncheon engagement not far away, so he dropped us off and we spent an hour and a half there. </p>
<p>I had bought a set of badminton rackets and after Riku discovered them, he was very keen to try them out. So we took those along, and this turned out to be a perfect place to practice. As well as a wonderfully set up playground with areas for both young and older children, there is a large open green space not far from a fenced-off soccer field. We had this whole spot to ourselves and it was a good thing, as those birdies went flying here and there and everywhere. Riku was able to hit them both behind and in front of him, while I tended to whack them far off to one side. We sure had fun, though! </p>
<p>We did go off so Riku could explore the play area too. They have a great set of balancing platters set up, so Riku tried those out, and watched as some older children crawled over and through linked loops as well. He agreed with me that Mirei will love the train on her next visit; it's a good sized one, and the bell rings too. </p>
<p>As soon as Riku had cooled down he wanted to get back to the badminton play, which is where Doug found us when he returned to pick us up. </p>
<p>We spent the rest of the day at home, with Riku working in the garden looking for bugs again, and watering the plants. Later on we snuggled on the sofa and read one of our very few books in the house suitable for Riku. I sent almost all of his books to Japan with him, not expecting him back so soon, so a visit to the library is planned. </p>
<p>Bryn and Riku went out for a walk as I was preparing dinner, but it was a very short one! They discovered a ripe Meyer lemon on the tree across the street, came back for a footstool, and went back to pick it. We shall make a lemon pudding cake with it sometime this week. Riku was just as pleased as punch, as Brynnie was when he picked lemons from the same tree on all of his spring visits with us. </p>
<p>Bryn went off for dinner at Susan's and Kevin's and to visit the children there, and Doug was at  his T'ai Chi class, so Riku and I had a quiet dinner and evening together. He had a long relaxing tub, we read a story snuggled up in his bed, and he was sound asleep at 8 P.M.  </p>
