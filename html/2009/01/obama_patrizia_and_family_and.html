								<h2>Obama!, Patrizia and Family, and Ocean Beach... What a Day!</h2>
								<p>Today started off as a very eventful one, as Barack Obama was sworn in as President of the United States of America. Doug listened to his acceptance speech on the radio as he drove Mirei to Little Angels, and Riku and I watched it on Doug's computer as we waited for Doug's return. Riku was totally involved in the whole procedure, asking me to point out President Bush, and showing great interest in the bodyguards, the bands ("I like the music!") and later on wanting to know all about Ted Kennedy and his collapse... why did it happen, what happened, how he was, was he going to die, etc. etc. </p>
<p>Today one of my doula moms, her husband, and one-year-old child are moving to Italy, Patrizia's original home. A young woman, Cara, who co-doula-ed with me for Patrizia's birth was a few minutes late picking me up to visit with Patrizia and Ehecatl, as she too wanted to see Obama's speech. We spent an hour and a half admiring Ehecatl's new walking skills(!), and catching up with our lives. We will all be staying in touch, as Cara too is off for some adventures, to Pakistan, and Denmark, after an interview in Connecticut for a nurse/midwifery position. It was hard to say goodbye at 10:30, but emails and Skype will be a huge plus, especially watching Ehecatl grow and change. </p>
<p>Riku and I picked Mirei up at school at 1 o'clock and headed out to Ocean Beach. It could not have been a more perfect January day for the beach... warm enough that the children could take off their slacks and run in and out of the water... at the edge... and yet not so warm that we worried about getting too much sun. We had arranged to meet Susan and the children there, and not too long after we got settled in the damp sand area, Amelia ran down the beach to join us. Finn was sleeping in the car, with Susan reading, and I took dozens and dozens of photos of the children playing in the mud holes nicely provided by the tide today, and just having a blast! </p>
<p>Susan and Finn joined us, and he had some time in the mud too. We stayed an hour later than I intended to, but it was just too hard to leave. It really was the best day of the week! </p>
<p>Riku did his piano practice while I had a cup of hot tea, Mirei played quietly in the room, and then after that came tub time for them both, dinner ( homemade mac' and cheese and veggies), and a few pages of English homework for Riku. At 6:15, Mirei said "I am tired. I want to go to bed now" and refused to eat another bite. She was asleep within five minutes, or less(!), of my turning out the light. </p>
<p>Bryn tucked Riku in, after Riku read to him, and Riku got to hear two new books sent out by Kelly and Gregg, one of which was meant for Mirei I learned the next morning. Bryn fell asleep with him, not intentionally, and I gave up trying to waken him after four attempts to do so. I went through a ton of photos from the past few days... I'm way behind in my blog photos! </p>
<p>I am off to sleep with Mirei, a rare event, as she has been sleeping with her Daddy except for the first two nights of Akane's time away.  </p>
