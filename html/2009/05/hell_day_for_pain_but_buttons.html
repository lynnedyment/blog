								<h2>Two Walks in the Rain, Pink Brollies, and — Oh Yes — Pain!</h2>
								<p>I slept very well last night, thanks to a pain killer and 2 MD sleep capsules. I had gone to bed at 10:30, and was aware of Riku lying awake beside me when it was light. I checked my watch, saw that it was 6:30 and told Riku he could get up and get a book. While he was gone, I glanced at my watch again and it was 5:30! It was so light in the room, that it was hard to believe it was so early but, as always when he wakens too early, Riku was happy lying beside me reading/looking quietly at his book, and a half hour later or so we lay there talking quietly. </p>
<p>Getting off my futon an hour later was not fun!  I am sure I was in the same position all night, on my back for the most part, as moving from one tiny area of one side to the other, a mere inch, just hurt too bloody much! It took me fifteen minutes to get off the three-inch futon and to make my way to the shower area. Most of that time was spent just getting myself over to the door, and then standing up, by grasping hold of the door frame and the end of the wall. </p>
<p>I had a pretty good day, though, much better than I expected to, given that beginning. I started off with a nice long hot shower, dressed slowly, helped with breakfast for Riku and ended up walking him to school as usual, if a bit slower than normal. I really love that time with him, and was able to enjoy the walk in the light drizzle with him, as the ladybugs were out in full swing. There was a group of girls ahead of us in the schoolyard, all three with lovely pink umbrellas, and I stopped to take a photo of them. I felt better when I got home and think the slow walk was a good idea. </p>
<p>I had my egg and toast, and Mirei and I had some hot chocolate too, while we listened to the songs on Akane's computer that Doug had sent for the children. Later on, we went for a nice stroll in the light rain, just to get out of the house together. Mirei insisted on taking along her backpack, reassuring me that she would carry it herself, as I told her I couldn't today, and she did too. She did look funny with it under her raincoat, though! </p>
<p>We did our usual walk, up to and past the bakery, stopping to see if they had a little pizza for Mirei's lunch (they didn't). Before going into the grocery store, just to poke around, I took a photo of a cigarette machine, as it has been years since we had them in North America. We paused for a moment on the way home to see if the "snowman" lady was out. Of course she wasn't, with the rain, but Mirei posed for me beside her gate.We both admired the small broom hanging there, one we have seen her use to sweep her sidewalk. </p>
<p>We were out for a whole hour, much to my surprise, but I was ready to sit once we got home. We had lunch together, and then Mirei and I sat on the sofa reading a nice little stack of books. She would pop off the sofa, get hold of two or three, put them back, choose two more, and on it went. When we ran out of books downstairs, I showed her some family videos on the computer, as she so enjoys seeing her cousins, not to mention herself, when she was really little. </p>
<p>Mirei kept herself busy combing my hair, zipping my fleece jacket up and down, and giving me lots of kisses. She is perfectly capable of finding things to do and is never bored. </p>
<p>Bryn had gone off late in the morning to work at the café, and came home a few hours later with a new bike! Akane had given him directions earlier on how to get to a couple of bike shops, and he was quite taken with a used folding bike. He was very proud of it and showed it off to Mirei and me; it's in great condition and he is looking forward to zipping off to cafes further afield. </p>
<p>Akane met Riku after school for his piano lesson, and then they were home for our usual evening routine. The children watched a children's program on TV for the first time since it arrived on Monday, and had their baths before dinner. </p>
<p>Just after dinner, while I was trying to help with the kitchen cleanup, the pain really set in again with a wallop. It hit me out of nowhere, it seemed, and I was close to crying. I think it's worse because I have never had back problems, and so move in ways that I shouldn't without thinking! </p>
<p>Getting up off the bed again after reading to Riku and lying beside him until he was asleep required help from Bryn. I called up to him in his office, after trying myself for ten minutes, and thank goodness he heard me. Akane had fallen asleep with Mirei, and I would have been stuck there for a while. I got to the door but just could not pull myself up. I can understand why people in extreme pain just want it to be over! Childbirth for both my children hurt less than this, and only lasted seven hours in total too. Given the choice ... yup, I would pick childbirth. </p>
<p>I sat at a chair at the table, with a cushion under me, and one behind my back, writing my blog and checking my emails with a nice hot bed buddy on my lower back. I took my pain pill — I have no idea what they are, but only have enough for two more days — and took Bryn up on a generous shot of his very expensive Johnny Walker whiskey with water. I refused a drink of this the first week I was here, and didn't enjoy the tiny taste of it I sampled one bit. But tonight I was willing to try anything at all, and it went down just fine. I went to bed when the pain had subsided, about 10:30, feeling much more relaxed. </p>
<p>p.s. I took a photo of two packages of carrots Akane had picked up. Two short but fat carrots in each bag, for a total of just over $2.00. They're expensive, but sweet and delicious. </p>
