								<h2>West Coast Live, and My First Letter from Riku!</h2>
								<p>Doug had booked us into today's airing for the local "West Coast Live" program this morning, one of our favourite public radio programs. We left in lots of time, as parking is impossible near the Ferry Building on Saturdays, so Doug dropped me off and he went off on his search. I stopped by the Acme bread booth and picked us up a small batch of sticky cinnamon rolls to eat while we waited in our second row seats. Yum! </p>
<p>The program starts at 10 A.M. and ends at the noon hour. Sedge Thomson, the host, is always friendly, welcoming, and open to all of his guests, knowledgeable about their various topics and fields of interest. We have been to several of these programs over the years and they are always entertaining.</p>
<p>Today's guests included Slaid Cleaves, a singer/songwriter we have seen here locally several times, and at the Cambridge folk festival in England in 2001. An author, Lisa Hamilton, gave a very interesting talk/interview on "unconventional farmers in the age of agribusiness", about the organic farmers she has talked with over the past two years. We very much enjoyed a food author/critic who wrote a book called "Hungry Monkey", a quest to introduce to his young daughter to good food. And to end the show, Mariel Hemingway promoted her new book about eating as well: "Mariel's Kitchen: Simple Ingredients for a Delicious and Satisfying Life". She is lovely and engaging and I am looking forward to trying the cookies she is bringing to market, using coconut flour. It was a relaxing and fun two hours and good to get out and do something local and entertaining. </p>

<p>The Saturday market was on, of course, and so we wandered slowly about (it is so crowded that the pace is slow anyway, suiting me just fine), doing some sampling, and buying some lovely fresh-picked tomatoes, snap peas, and new tiny Yukon Gold potatoes. It was a lovely outing, but it did tucker me out and I was happy to be home with a hot cup of tea on the sofa. </p>
<p>Lucky me! Today's mail brought an extra-special treat, my very first letter from Riku. When I was in Japan, Bryn had been encouraging Riku to write letters to friends. Kai, a pal from his "Little Angel's" program had written and sent along a couple of photos, plus a drawing. Riku answered that, then wrote to Skylar, a special girl from his grade one class here in San Francisco. She got a drawing as well, and I was very happy to find that I was on the list too! I hope this is the beginning of a long correspondence with my youngest grandson. </p>
