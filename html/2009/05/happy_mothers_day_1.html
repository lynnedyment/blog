								<h2>Happy Mother's Day!</h2>
								<p>Riku was downstairs at 6:30 again this morning, although was sad because he had called to his dad in the night, and Bryn ended up sleeping with him. I'm sure in a way that was nice for him, but he is taking great pride in sleeping on his own and no doubt was disappointed with himself on some level too. We can't snuggle on the sofa until after I get up, as there is just no room, but he happily went off busying himself in the kitchen again, and of course I guessed that he was making me my fruit bowl again, as he asked me not to peek. I snuggled back under the duvet, and could hear Akane and Mirei in the kitchen with him. I know he wanted to do this on his own, but Akane helped him put some yogurt into a bowl for my tray. He came walking in to the living room, bearing it proudly with Mirei beside him, smiling away at their surprise. A lovely way to start off Mother's Day indeed! </p>
<p>Riku got busy immediately, drawing a lovely picture for Akane, and Bryn was upstairs doing something mysterious with paper and pencil crayons too. Mirei told me it was a surprise. Shhhh. Soon he came down bearing a homemade card for me, an old tradition and one I hold dearly in my heart. I have all the cards my children have made for me over the years. Lucky me! </p>
<p>I took a long hot steamy shower today while Bryn and Akane fed the children, and they kept busy with paper and glue and bits of paper. </p>
<p>Just before 9 o'clock Bryn and Akane went off on their bikes to the doctor's clinic as Bryn had an appointment to have his sinus problem rechecked. He has been suffering with this since before I arrived, and it was a problem in San Francisco for him too. He doesn't say much, but it sure takes its toll on Bryn's comfort level. </p>
<p>Just after 11 o'clock Bryn and I headed off to brunch together, just the two of us, on the bus. Last night Akane had phoned a vegetarian restaurant specializing in tofu, one of my very favourite foods, and ordered what she thought would be a special meal for me. We got there a little bit early, so Bryn was able to tell me and show me about the special group of shops that the restaurant was part of ... traditional Kyoto stores, with storefronts and the owner's homes set in behind. This set of five or six had been carefully renovated and housed a number of very nice little restaurants ... Italian, Japanese, and the one we were going to. </p>
<p>It was very special. Akane and Bryn both thought it would be a good spot for me as they have tables set down into the floor so that one can sit with one's legs in a pit, and not kneeling as is more traditional in many eating places here, even casual ones. I could not have managed that at all, and Bryn had to help me back to a standing position at the end of our meal. I was very comfortable throughout the meal, though, and enjoyed every single bite of it. </p>
<p>I was a bit surprised when the tray first arrived, as there was a bowl of soup with one of the partially cooked eggs on top, something I just cannot handle. However, Bryn knew that Akane had changed that course for me, and had the tray passed over to him instead. Whew! This was just a wonderful meal, from the soup through all the mysterious and various tofu dishes, to the really yummy soft tofu "cr√®me caramel". I could happily have eaten two of them, even though it was a generous portion! The service was perfect, with both women who served us being very warm and friendly. We enjoyed the traditional smoky Kyoto tea with our meal as well. </p>
<p>Bryn is a big fan of American-styled coffee shops, built in the early 1950s when there were a lot of American servicemen in Japan, rebuilding after the war. In the States we have many remakes of these coffee shops ... "Johnny Rocket's" is a big one, but I know there are others around too. They're spanking new, but the ones here are the originals, which means they are somewhat grungy, smell of over fifty years of heavy cigarette smoke, well soaked into the velvety cushions, set into dark wood. The low ceilings with hanging lamps, the banquette seating and the old linoleum floors complete the ambiance. Even though Bryn is not a big fan of the smoke-infused air, he loves the whole set-up. It's real, authentic, and he thinks it won't be too long before they start tearing these places down. I chose to go for tea in one he has been to before, just a block or two walk away, and it was just what I expected. The air hit me hard though; it's been a long time since I have walked into an eating area that smelled quite so dense with tobacco! I had tea, Bryn had coffee, and I snuck a couple of photos of the side/back view of an elderly man sitting at the booth behind Bryn. How I wished I could have just boldly walked up to him and asked if I could take his photo. He looked like someone out of a Japanese movie with his small pony tail, his wonderful soft gray pants, covered with a classically gorgeous long soft jacket/shirt top, and with soft black cloth slipper/shoes. I couldn't see his face until he and his family got up to leave, but it was more interesting than I was expecting it to be. </p>
<p>Akane and I had gone to a wonderful French bakery a few weeks ago, and it was very close by. Bryn hadn't been, but of course we had told him about it, so we walked there to pick up some bread. Edith Piaf was still singing, and the same friendly woman was taking care of the shop. Bryn bought some pain au levain and another loaf of some kind, and insisted on taking a photo of me outside, with my fingers held up in the "traditional" peace sign that so many people, especially the children, automatically make when a camera is pointed at them. </p>
<p>Back at home, the children and I took a stroll for ice cream at the nearby 7/11 store. Riku wanted a toy rather than ice cream (he's not a big fan, just as his cousin Bryn wasn't at his age either), but it didn't take much to persuade him that he might like the same frozen treat that Mirei had chosen. I had them wait until they got home to eat it, as it was a hot day and I knew it would be a big mess on the slow walk home. However, I could feel my own chocolate frozen bar was getting soft fast, so I attempted to eat mine while walking and had to change my top when I got in: it had dripped all the way down the front! The children both thought that was <strong>very</strong> funny! </p>
<p>After eating their own cones, Riku went upstairs on his own for some time in his room, while Mirei asked if she could check out my makeup bag. I gave her permission and sat totally intrigued watching her add lipstick with no mirror, eye shadow, eyebrow pencil and blush to those already rosy cheeks! It was adorable, and such a fun thing to observe. </p>
<p>While Akane got dinner for the children, Riku read "Adele and Simon" to me and Mirei. He had done his piano by that point, and had finished writing his twenty-five English spelling words with Bryn, and we had time for a few stories, while Mirei half listened and played on the sofa beside us. </p>
<p>Bryn showered with both children before dinner as well; it's a treat for them to be in the big bath area together, and while I was there I tended to bath the children separately as it made for a more relaxing time for them both. </p>
<p>Kelly sent me a lovely "Happy Mother's Day!" message from a friend's iPhone, as she was out of town for a Creative Memories weekend. Nice relaxing Mother's Day for her too, and she suggested we have a long talk once I get home. </p>
<p>I wasn't hungry at all, and asked Bryn to make me up a fruit and veggie plate. He did a great(!) job on it, and it was just what my body was craving. I sat on the sofa with some magazines while the children ate, and smiled watching Mirei getting a ride on her daddy's leg and dancing about the living room. </p>
<p>Bedtime followed, with both children asleep before 8 o'clock, and then it was time for Bryn to take Akane out for dinner for her Mother's Day treat. I worked on the computer until they got home; they hadn't managed to get into the place they had hoped to, as it was booked solid for Mother's Day, not something they had expected at all. However, they had a quiet evening out and enjoyed it. </p>
<p>Akane helped me get out the duvets out and the pillows and soon after I was tucked into bed. </p>
