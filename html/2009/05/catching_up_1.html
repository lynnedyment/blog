								<h2>A Long Day of Catching Up</h2>
								<p>Happy Mirei joined Riku and me in bed this morning for some silly stuff like showing me her belly, wanting to check out my belly button, rolling around and putting her feet near my ears, and trying to pay attention to Riku, who was trying very hard to get her to listen to who was who in one of his Ultraman magazines. Once in a while she would say "Oh, I know that guy, Riku!" but one could sense her heart wasn't really in it. </p>
<p>Akane had invited the family of Mirei's French school companion over today, and since they were due to arrive at 10 A.M. our little bit of morning seemed to fly by! Both children did some drawing, and I took a very long shower/bath, with Riku running to the door twice and telling me first that he had already done his reading, and then that he had done all his spelling; it took him less than four minutes again today for a different set of 25 words! So exciting! It's always good to have two of his daily routines out of the way so early in the day, as one never knows how the rest of the day will go. </p>
<p>Riku and Mirei had time to sit and relax together watching a movie, and some quiet time was just what they needed before their long day of being host and hostess got started. </p>
<p>At 10:10, the doorbell rang and the mom and two young children came in. Mirei's little friend, Kiko, just turned four, but is very very tiny, almost like an early two year old, and her brother is five. An older brother, Shouya,  joined them later in the afternoon after soccer practice. </p>
<p>The house was very busy and very loud at times too, and I was in Bryn's office with Akane's computer for most of their seven-hour visit! Bryn had gone to a caf√© in the morning and then joined them all here just before lunch. There were three adults for three children, which seemed a very good ratio to me. </p>
<p>There were a few issues at the beginning of the visit, as Haruki, the boy playing with Riku was determined to keep one of Riku's special Lego construction pieces, and take apart a huge set that Riku had spent a lot of time putting together. I "rescued" that particular set when they were downstairs for a few minutes, and so those two problems were solved. It seems the Japanese "way" of handling things like this is to talk to the child about what is fair and not fair, but not to actually intervene. Riku was in tears and said he "hated play dates!", but of course ending up having lots of fun not too much later. </p>
<p>Mirei and Kako spent a lot of time playing with the little kitchen upstairs, and with the strollers downstairs, and except for a tiny bit of squabbling, with tears on Mirei's part over one pair of sparkly dangly plastic earrings (!), these two little girls enjoyed each other's company too. </p>
<p>I got through so many emails during all that time, as well as doing a great job transcribing notes for my blog from paper to computer. I did puzzle over some of those late-night jottings but I did it! There was even time for a little family tree work, a nice way to finish off my session.  </p>
<p>Once the company left just after 5 P.M., the children had some quiet time together, and with me. I was reading the wonderful "Adelle and Simon" to Mirei when Riku joined us, so we all got to hunt for Simon's lost items together. </p>
<p>Then it was tub time for Riku. His very favourite thing to do now is to have our water "fight", just before it's time for him to come out. I think this was our third night at this, and I was the big loser tonight. He was all set with his tiny yellow duck, ready to squirt me the first time I opened the folding door! I got him too, several times, but he was sitting in the tub naked and wet anyway, so it had less impact on him.! </p>
<p>While all that was going on,  Bryn did some printing with Mirei (she learned to print "MOMMY" tonight, and that "Y" was a new letter for her to write). She learns so quickly, and so willingly! It's such fun to watch her enthusiasm and prowess! And her big "yahoo" as she did it a second time was priceless. </p>
<p>Mirei blew "rainbow" bubbles in the tub for her "treat". Heaven knows I don't need two children trying to soak me. She loves to help me put her cream on, and then I have to smell her and tell her how wonderful she smells. She got hand cream on too tonight, and learned how to rub the extra into her elbows, both at once! She enjoys being a girl. </p>
<p>Akane had put together a sushi dinner for them tonight. I'm a little squeamish about watching the children eat raw fish, so went through some magazines in my room while they all had some dinner time on their own. I joined them right at the end and ate some avocado, edamame, cucumbers and barley "rice", all of which I thoroughly enjoyed.  </p>
<p>Riku had a full tummy and happily played the piano for a half hour, even though it was the end of a very busy day. He sounds so good that Bryn and I just shook our heads at each other as he played his newest piece so well.</p>
<p>Bedtime followed quickly, as it was 7:30 by that time, and 7:45 before we were sitting side by side reading one more chapter in our book. We're getting close to the end, and even though it's probably a better book for an eight or nine year old, Riku is enjoying it. </p>
<p>One of the little rituals we have developed over the last two weeks, perhaps, at bedtime, is for Riku to stand on a folded over duvet, with two regular pillows on top of that, and then one thick foamy pillow, so that he can pull the cord to turn our over-the-bed light on (when we are getting ready to read, and then off, when we finish. He has to balance carefully, as it's all a bit unstable, we hold hands, and tonight it seemed easier than ever. I told him I thought he had grown an inch! </p>
<p>Akane fell asleep with Mirei, Bryn worked upstairs in his office, I worked on the computer, and headed off to bed at 10:30, feeling so good about getting so much done!</p>
