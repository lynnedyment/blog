								<h2><a href="/2009/05/cabbages_and_flower_wreaths_an.html">Cabbages and Flower Wreaths, and Acquaintances Old and New</a></h2>
								<p>What a lovely day this was! The sun was shining, the air was warm, and there was a slight breeze. Riku and I left for school five minutes earlier than usual, at 8 A.M., and so I had time to stop to take a photo of the very friendly neighbour on the next block who never fails to say good morning to us, with a big smile, and a slight bow. And there are always an extra few words for Riku as well. </p>
<p>Coming home, I decided to take a new street, and passed by one of the many commercial gardens in this area. I saw a man cutting lovely big cabbages, and stopped to have a look at them, and at the quickly-filling pea pods too. We had exchanged greetings and I walked on, but he stopped me with a "one moment" in English. He proceeded to cut a lovely big cabbage for me! I was so very pleased and thanked him so much, and asked if I could take his photo. He was a little shy about it, but nodded yes. I do like to have these memories of the friendly people I meet! </p>
<p>Akane went to Osaka/Sakai on her own today, via bus, train, train, subway, and bus I believe. Mirei and I set off at 10:30 to walk to the grocery store for those groceries we tried to get yesterday, but she had spotted what we thought might be a playground on the way home from that trip. I am so glad she had mentioned it, as we stopped by there first and met a "Baba" and her three-year-old grandson there. He and Mirei played so well together, and the grandmother was fun too, playing "baseball" with them both, and then weaving a lovely head wreath of blossoms for Mirei. The children picked the flowers for them, and followed each other around the big field exploring. We hope to meet up again tomorrow. </p>
<p>And once again today, we passed another "regular" on our walks, an older woman who is blind in one eye. It's permanently closed, and as we stopped to chat with her a bit as she was resting against a wall, Mirei asked her lots of questions. but all in Japanese so I have no idea what they said to each other. </p>
<p>We continued on, bought our groceries, and a tired little girl after an hour and a half of physical activity unpacked the groceries from her tiny bag, looking every bit the little housewife. </p>
<p>Our afternoon was busy with various activities, and Mirei snacked, and snacked, and snacked. She must be going through a growth spurt, as the calories going into this little body are huge! We went out to see if we could see Riku coming, waited a few minutes, and were greeted with his big smile. They had a snack together, then played for a while, before Riku ran over to invite Yuu-kun to play for an hour. </p>
<p>I put together a very quick dinner for the children, from various bits and pieces in the fridge, and after their tub Riku especially ate so much and so well. The usual reading/spelling followed, and Riku drew a picture of this house for Skylar, his "special" friend at Starr King in San Francisco. </p>
<p>Akane arrived home in time to say goodnight to Riku, although Mirei was fast asleep by then! Her daddy tucked a very tired little girl in at 7:15. </p>
<p>That's it folks!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/a_gorgeous_hot_sunny_day_a_riv.html">A Gorgeous Hot Sunny Day, a River, and Two Princesses</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke this morning telling me he dreamed about Skylar, a classmate in his grade one class in San Francisco (and a girl he admits to "liking"). He always gets a little grin on his face when he, or anyone else, mentions her name. He drew a picture for her this morning after breakfast, and sometime soon will write her a letter too. Her mom emailed Bryn yesterday to say that Skylar had been talking about Riku too, and she hoped they would become pen pals. </p>
<p>Riku had a follow-up visit with an allergist before noon today, and he had shown some interest in going "to the steps by Mirei's school" as well.  I bought a day pass for ¥500 (approximately $5.00), as we had a fair number of bus trips to do today. We ran quite a few errands before lunch at the Chinese restaurant where we ate two weeks ago ... picking up some meds for Riku's ongoing sinus infection/allergy problem, and walking to his skin specialist for an ongoing problem as well. There was lots of walking between all these places, and both children were such troopers about it. </p>
<p>Finally we were on the number 9 bus that we take to Mirei's school, and got off at the same stop. The "steps" Riku was talking about are a city renewal project of a once pristine river that flows through the city, and that had fallen into disrepair over the years. I'm not sure when it was finished, but what a lovely spot it is! Halfway there, Riku, tired from walking, sitting at the restaurant, and then sitting on a crowded bus, had decided he wanted to go home and not to the steps. But he was one happy camper, as was Mirei, once we got there. </p>
<p>The river at this spot is very very shallow, not even knee deep for children, and it's a long straight passageway with a bridge further along, and perfectly spaced concrete blocks, set in the water, for children and adults to walk along. Riku chose to walk in the water, playing with a boat he had with him, and even though Mirei and I took off our shoes to walk there too, the rocks were just a little too pebbly for our tender feet! </p>
<p>We walked back out, and were sitting on a bench, when Mirei noticed two older children from her French school. They spotted her too, and came running over to speak to her. They speak Japanese as well, which was the language they used with Mirei, and soon the three of them, plus Riku, were chasing each other around and around the area. </p>
<p>Akane had gone off to pick up the new sign for their mailbox, so it now reads Goda/Dyment in something more substantial than the paper Bryn had taped to it when they moved in. Along with some bread and cold cereal (Riku is getting tired of porridge) she came back with small cans of apple juice for the children. After chatting with the girls for a bit, we said goodbye and waited at the bus stop for the number 9 back to our neighbourhood. We lucked out again and all ended up with seats at the back of the bus after just two stops. I was glad I had some snacks with me, as did Akane, to keep Mirei from falling asleep. She was such a tired girl! </p>
<p>Riku did his spelling session with Bryn tonight, which beat last night's record of 25 words in less than four minutes! Riku enjoys doing this, as he's good at it, and can obviously print very quickly too. He read three chapters of a story book to Mirei and me, a treat for sure, as Mirei was very interested in the story, and he reads with lots of expression in his voice, when he's not tired. </p>
<p>After her tub, Mirei sat to do some printing with her dad, and came running into my room, so very excited, because she had printed both her name and mine without being told which letters to use!  I am so amazed at how quickly this little girl learns things! </p>
<p>Mirei has been dressing up in her princess dresses a lot over the past couple of days, and this morning Riku decided to join her. It is the funniest thing, as he makes quite a cute girl, and it's just hilarious to see him wearing a skirt, or lovely dress, and tiara, plus whatever bracelets, rings, and necklaces Mirei decides to share with him. I missed the evening photo but Riku promised he would get dressed up again for me soon. Mirei liked her plastic dangling earrings — and some of those necklaces — so much that she decided to wear them in the tub tonight too. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep at 7:40, Mirei not too much later, and Akane and Bryn went out for a late dinner at a Korean barbecue place, followed by an hour in a very smoky karaoke bar, with really bad videos of the songs being sung. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/catching_up_1.html">A Long Day of Catching Up</a></h2>
								<p>Happy Mirei joined Riku and me in bed this morning for some silly stuff like showing me her belly, wanting to check out my belly button, rolling around and putting her feet near my ears, and trying to pay attention to Riku, who was trying very hard to get her to listen to who was who in one of his Ultraman magazines. Once in a while she would say "Oh, I know that guy, Riku!" but one could sense her heart wasn't really in it. </p>
<p>Akane had invited the family of Mirei's French school companion over today, and since they were due to arrive at 10 A.M. our little bit of morning seemed to fly by! Both children did some drawing, and I took a very long shower/bath, with Riku running to the door twice and telling me first that he had already done his reading, and then that he had done all his spelling; it took him less than four minutes again today for a different set of 25 words! So exciting! It's always good to have two of his daily routines out of the way so early in the day, as one never knows how the rest of the day will go. </p>
<p>Riku and Mirei had time to sit and relax together watching a movie, and some quiet time was just what they needed before their long day of being host and hostess got started. </p>
<p>At 10:10, the doorbell rang and the mom and two young children came in. Mirei's little friend, Kiko, just turned four, but is very very tiny, almost like an early two year old, and her brother is five. An older brother, Shouya,  joined them later in the afternoon after soccer practice. </p>
<p>The house was very busy and very loud at times too, and I was in Bryn's office with Akane's computer for most of their seven-hour visit! Bryn had gone to a café in the morning and then joined them all here just before lunch. There were three adults for three children, which seemed a very good ratio to me. </p>
<p>There were a few issues at the beginning of the visit, as Haruki, the boy playing with Riku was determined to keep one of Riku's special Lego construction pieces, and take apart a huge set that Riku had spent a lot of time putting together. I "rescued" that particular set when they were downstairs for a few minutes, and so those two problems were solved. It seems the Japanese "way" of handling things like this is to talk to the child about what is fair and not fair, but not to actually intervene. Riku was in tears and said he "hated play dates!", but of course ending up having lots of fun not too much later. </p>
<p>Mirei and Kako spent a lot of time playing with the little kitchen upstairs, and with the strollers downstairs, and except for a tiny bit of squabbling, with tears on Mirei's part over one pair of sparkly dangly plastic earrings (!), these two little girls enjoyed each other's company too. </p>
<p>I got through so many emails during all that time, as well as doing a great job transcribing notes for my blog from paper to computer. I did puzzle over some of those late-night jottings but I did it! There was even time for a little family tree work, a nice way to finish off my session.  </p>
<p>Once the company left just after 5 P.M., the children had some quiet time together, and with me. I was reading the wonderful "Adelle and Simon" to Mirei when Riku joined us, so we all got to hunt for Simon's lost items together. </p>
<p>Then it was tub time for Riku. His very favourite thing to do now is to have our water "fight", just before it's time for him to come out. I think this was our third night at this, and I was the big loser tonight. He was all set with his tiny yellow duck, ready to squirt me the first time I opened the folding door! I got him too, several times, but he was sitting in the tub naked and wet anyway, so it had less impact on him.! </p>
<p>While all that was going on,  Bryn did some printing with Mirei (she learned to print "MOMMY" tonight, and that "Y" was a new letter for her to write). She learns so quickly, and so willingly! It's such fun to watch her enthusiasm and prowess! And her big "yahoo" as she did it a second time was priceless. </p>
<p>Mirei blew "rainbow" bubbles in the tub for her "treat". Heaven knows I don't need two children trying to soak me. She loves to help me put her cream on, and then I have to smell her and tell her how wonderful she smells. She got hand cream on too tonight, and learned how to rub the extra into her elbows, both at once! She enjoys being a girl. </p>
<p>Akane had put together a sushi dinner for them tonight. I'm a little squeamish about watching the children eat raw fish, so went through some magazines in my room while they all had some dinner time on their own. I joined them right at the end and ate some avocado, edamame, cucumbers and barley "rice", all of which I thoroughly enjoyed.  </p>
<p>Riku had a full tummy and happily played the piano for a half hour, even though it was the end of a very busy day. He sounds so good that Bryn and I just shook our heads at each other as he played his newest piece so well.</p>
<p>Bedtime followed quickly, as it was 7:30 by that time, and 7:45 before we were sitting side by side reading one more chapter in our book. We're getting close to the end, and even though it's probably a better book for an eight or nine year old, Riku is enjoying it. </p>
<p>One of the little rituals we have developed over the last two weeks, perhaps, at bedtime, is for Riku to stand on a folded over duvet, with two regular pillows on top of that, and then one thick foamy pillow, so that he can pull the cord to turn our over-the-bed light on (when we are getting ready to read, and then off, when we finish. He has to balance carefully, as it's all a bit unstable, we hold hands, and tonight it seemed easier than ever. I told him I thought he had grown an inch! </p>
<p>Akane fell asleep with Mirei, Bryn worked upstairs in his office, I worked on the computer, and headed off to bed at 10:30, feeling so good about getting so much done!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/long_shower_for_me_bryn.html">Visitors for the Children, a Walk Along the River, and a Quiet Evening Home Alone</a></h2>
								<p>It's "Golden Week", a national holiday here so Riku has the next three days off school. It was such a treat to have both children join me in bed for cuddles this morning, three days in a row. Bryn told me not long after we finally emerged from my room, that Akane's mother and sister would be visiting today, arriving some time mid-morning. </p>
<p>While they got breakfast going for the children, I took a really long shower and then soaked in the tub for a while, just relaxing. It's the first time I have tubbed this trip, being a shower kind of gal, but it was nice to sink down in that big stainless steel tub. </p>
<p>Knowing the day was going to be busy, Riku got his reading and spelling out of the way early today, and Mirei and I passed some time in my room, looking at a funny video her cousin Bryn had made, and then of course we went on to watch lots of others of all the children after that. </p>
<p>Ayako and Mrs. Goda arrived about 10:15, about ten minutes after Riku's piano practice had started. There was lots of excitement, as their grandmother had arrived with lots of food treats, which both children wanted to sample right away, and some small gifts for them as well. I said hello and then left them to have some time together. Mirei was happy to have their full attention while Riku finished playing, and then he too was busy visiting, and eating. </p>
<p>I took the time to myself to read quietly in my room. Propped up with two pillows on my futon on the floor, windows open to a nice breeze, I was nice and cozy and enjoyed getting something done too. At 11:30, they all headed out for lunch and shopping, so at noon I made Bryn and me a hot lunch of pasta with fresh tomatoes, cheese, and some carrot sticks. Bryn went right back to work and I spent two plus hours on the computer emailing and blogging. </p>
<p>By then I was ready to stretch my legs, so left the house at 3:30, walked down to the river and along that lovely path for a long time. There were lots of people out, couples walking, children in the little play areas, joggers, elderly men and women well covered in hats and long sleeves, and cyclists. There were lots of benches scattered about, and I sat to read for a bit, although really spent more time watching all the action. </p>
<p>As I was sitting, I was attempting to open a new bottle of water I bought at the 7/11 on the way down. I have the worst times with those lids for some reason, and a man walking by happened to notice me struggling with it. He came over to offer help, which I gladly accepted, and then we "chatted" for about close to an hour or more. </p>
<p>This was such an interesting encounter, as of course I speak about five words of Japanese (and don't always get those words pronounced correctly!), but it was perhaps three more words than this fellow knew in English. Well, not quite but more of that later. Despite the lack of a common language, we did manage to communicate over the course of that time, that I was born in England, raised in Canada, flew to Osaka from San Francisco, and then took a train to Kyoto. And yes, I was on my own, visiting my son (not sure this was understood), and had two young grandchildren. He was born and raised here in Kyoto, doesn't have a passport, has never left Japan, and has four grandchildren. </p>
<p>I believe he was attempting to ask me out, as he asked if I liked sushi. Just try explaining to someone in another language that one doesn't eat meat (and yes, I know that not all sushi is meat or fish related, but I assumed in his case it was what he meant). And yes, embarrassingly, as Bryn later told me it was, I moo-ed and baa-ed and even tried to get some young teen students there to help us out. So, no word for "no meat" but I said "no" to "steak?" with sawing motion, "yes" to spaghetti, "yes" to wine, and another "yes" to ice cream. But it was obvious we had said all there was to be said, and so it was "sayonara" after that. It was a very pleasant encounter and I spoke with another set of three young students, all thirteen, and happy to practice their English with me. </p>
<p>I was back home before Akane, Ayako, and the children, as they had dropped Mrs. Goda off at the train station for her trip back to Osaka, and then fed the children dinner. They didn't arrive home until almost 7 o'clock so it was a short evening at home for them: baths, dessert, and bed late at 8:15. Both asleep very quickly after such a busy day out and about for all those hours. And they came home with a flat screen TV (for the tatami room when Mrs. Goda visits), and a bigger one for the living room on order, gifts from Mrs. Goda. </p>
<p>Once the children were asleep, Akane, Ayako, and Bryn went out for dinner. I had some computer time. a bonus catch-up day for me today, and they were back at 10. Akane and Ayako went off for a walk, and I headed off to bed at 10:30 tonight, tired after a long day, and ready for tomorrow! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/riku_awake_at_6_both.html">Tuesday ... Another Happy Encounter, and a Surprise Afternoon Snack</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 6 A.M. today, sooner than he should have, but Mirei joined us at 6:30, happy to see us both awake. I sat with them while they ate their fruit bowls, and while Akane showered, we all ate eggs and toast. Akane set up the TV her mother bought yesterday, but after watching a bit about bento boxes, they went back to drawing and then got busy with a floor puzzle. This particular one is a 24-piece map of the world, and Riku has taught Mirei to jump on the countries, continents, or familiar place names, so she now knows Australia, Japan, Canada, San Francisco (there is a picture of the Golden Gate bridge), and sometimes she can find where Auntie Kelly lives too. </p>
<p>Both children put on their boots and went off hunting for bugs, in both the front and back of the house. They were successful and soon both had a small Styrofoam tray lined with leaves, twigs, and pill bugs. Mirei is not squeamish at all as she wants to touch them and inspect them just like her big brother. Riku was delighted when he found a small slug under a rock in the front garden area, and that hour went by very quickly for them! </p>
<p>By then Ayako was awake, so they were busy entertaining her. I hung up some laundry although it was looking and feeling a lot like rain. There was some alone time for me to tidy up my storage area in the room; I have lots of children's clothes to take home with me, and getting them right into my bag helps keep my closet area organized. Akane went off on her bike to pick up some groceries, while Ayako showered, and I put Mirei's hair into a little whale spout.</p>
<p>Soon it was time for a walk with Mirei while Riku did his piano practice, and Ayako joined us. We went up to the second playground, to see if we could find the same little boy who was there the other day, but instead there was a three-year-old girl with her dad. </p>
<p>Mirei is just so outgoing and friendly, and walked right up to them. Not much later she was inspecting the little girl's bag. Mirei had forgotten to load up with her own bags today, but she was very happy checking out the "cell phone", the change purse, and a second little wallet instead. It was very nice that the child didn't seem to mind this at all, although Mirei was generously sharing a little bag of candy with her. </p>
<p>I wanted to take Ayako to meet Mirei's "friend", the elderly woman with the snowman skirt, and she was outside hanging up her bedding! Mirei thought she looked very funny with her big glasses on today, something that perhaps she hasn't noticed before since we have always been closer to her, and Mirei could concentrate instead on her necklace and clothing. </p>
<p>Right next to her house is the big vegetable patch with peas growing so quickly, we can almost see the peas forming! How tempted we are to pick just one, but of course we can't. However, there was a fairly large group of people having a picnic/barbecue in the middle of this large garden area, and they were smiling, looking at Mirei, and finally waved their arms and "asked" us to join them! I am having so many of these nice encounters that I am not surprised any more, but Ayako was very surprised. </p>
<p>So, we walked around the corner, and noticed a woman who had just picked a big basket of fresh strawberries from her patch. Mirei smiled at her, and of course the woman offered her a bright red, juicy strawberry to nibble on, before we walked into the garden across the way. We walked up to this large friendly group, at which point Mirei decided to be a little shy. </p>
<p>That didn't last long though, as one man opened a new container of dark blue grapes and gave her a big clump of them, another offered her barbecued sardines (which she refused), and yet another gave her a whole closed container of dessert: white bread with the crusts cut off, spread with heavy cream, and layered with sliced strawberries! Most of the group came up to speak to us, and offering us all food. Ayako happily accepted a brochette of chicken and onions, and some sardines too. There were a couple left over, which Ayako was encouraged to take with her, and Akane told me later they were delicious. As we left we turned to give them all a big wave, Mirei called out goodbye in Japanese to them, and the whole group waved back at us. It is my favourite kind of interaction with the locals! </p>
<p>Not long after arriving home, Akane and Ayako went out for lunch together, and the children and I went up to their room to start clearing it up a bit. Riku wants everything in place, and works hard at keeping his side "ship-shape" as Mom would have said. Mirei finds new things to distract her at every turn, and has a great time with it all. </p>
<p>It was threatening to rain still, but Ayako had a hair appointment, and Akane had planned to take the children to the botanical garden, so they could spend more time with Ayako after that. However, Riku decided he wanted some quiet time at home instead; we had interrupted that time with his mom when we came back from our walk. </p>
<p>So, at 2 o'clock, the three gals left us, and Riku and I spent about an hour and a half in his room together. He was collecting all his loose Lego pieces together in one spot, tossing things he decided he no longer wanted (what a concept!), and I started putting Mirei's clothes in her numerous drawers. Bryn decided where the best spot for her bed would be, and that made a huge difference in the amount of floor space the children have for playing. </p>
<p>Riku went downstairs at one point, and came up, much to my surprise, with a snack for me! It was just the sweetest thing ... Bryn had found him trying to cut an orange with a regular kitchen knife, so helped him with that, but he had also peeled a banana for me, put both on a plate, somehow reached a tiny glass for me and carried it, filled with water, upstairs along with the plate of fruit. Bryn had assumed it was for Riku himself, and was as pleased as I was to learn later than it had been for his Nana. </p>
<p>Bryn popped in a video, "Dogs and Cats", for him as a treat, I went down to make tea, and after preparing a nice snack for him, joined him. He laughs harder and more when there is someone beside him enjoying it too. It was relaxing and fun to sit together in the quiet house, and I managed to get a bit more done in their room, before Akane and Ayako arrived home. </p>
<p>Dinner was an hour later than usual tonight, so Riku did his reading with Bryn before his tub, and Mirei did a little more printing while Riku tubbed. Dinner was delicious: a big plate of lightly cooked spring cabbage with garlic, and pasta with tomato sauce. </p>
<p>We're getting ever closer to the end of our book and read for twenty minutes tonight before turning off the light. It was 8:15, though, as he was quite congested once he lay down.  Akane and Ayoko went out for dinner, I did lots of emailing and some blogging, and went off to bed at 10:30 when they returned home. It was a busy, productive, but relaxing day. Oh, and it did rain, and all the clothes were on the line! <br />

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/wednesday_feels_like_sunday.html">Wednesday ... Felt Like Sunday, and Then Came the Big Hole!</a></h2>
								<p>It felt like Sunday today, because Riku just had five days off, and tomorrow he returns to school. He's had his Baba here for a day, and Auntie Ayako for two extra days, so the time no doubt went by quickly for him. </p>
<p>Today we had a very early start, with Riku awake at 5 A.M.! He agreed to try to get back to sleep, but a half hour later I suggested he get a book and read for a bit. He came back with paper and pencil and sat beside me drawing quietly. The book came next and he had his banana while he read. We got up at 6:30, and met Bryn in the kitchen; everyone else was still sleeping, including Mirei, who finally woke after 7, very unusual for her these days. Riku, in the meantime, had kept busy and very quiet doing some cutting and pasting to make his own face, which he changed into his dad with the addition of eyebrows! </p>
<p>After breakfast the children played happily together in their bedroom for the longest time. Riku was helping Mirei clear her bed of all the toys, games, stuffed animals, and collection of myriad bags, purses, hair accessories, and doo-dads! Her part of the room reminds me of Caillie's: every single object, no matter how tiny or what it's made of — plastic, paper, cellophane — is precious, and must not go in the garbage! </p>
<p>Riku did his piano while Mirei had some time alone with her aunt upstairs. Bryn is, of course, working, as it is Tuesday in North America.</p>
<p>Late in the morning, Ayako and Akane went out to run an errand and I suggested they have lunch out together, as Ayako is leaving this afternoon at 2. I made up some fried rice for lunch, and heated up the cabbage dish leftovers to go with it. Bryn joined us for lunch today, and I had a tiny bit of pasta, also a leftover. </p>
<p>The plan was for me to take the children to the playground for a long stretch for all of us, but both of them were reluctant to go out. They were playing dress-up in their room and Riku happily co-operated with Mirei, as she made suggestions and helped him with it all, and then paraded downstairs to show him off to me. It was so funny and such a great rainy day activity for them.</p>
<p>Mirei walked around for most of that time with her "packback" loaded onto her shoulders, and usually two extra bags as well in her hands, all set with extra scarves and accessories to add to Riku's outfit. What a girl she is! I wouldn't be at all surprised if one day this girl walks miles on treks without missing a beat, volunteering to carry everyone else's bags! </p>
<p>I again suggested that we all put on our raincoats, take our umbrellas and go to the playground, but had no takers. Eventually though they decided to put on their rain gear and go outside to look for pill bugs in the front garden area. About fifteen minutes later,  they started arguing about some little tool that belonged to Mirei; Bryn asked me to have them both come in the house. We had been expecting Akane and Ayako home a half hour before, to say goodbye to the children, so it was time for a change anyway, and boy, did we get it! </p>
<p>Unbeknown to me, Riku had lifted a very heavy iron manhole cover off a sewage access hole, about four feet deep. (A few days later I asked him how he managed to move it, as it was really heavy. His answer ... he lifted it with some difficulty, but then kicked it off the rest of the way with his shoe.) Riku came into the house right away, but I went out for Mirei, and stepped right into that hole with my left foot and leg! Thank goodness it was me, and not Mirei or Riku, was all I could think later on! </p>
<p>What a shock this was, and what a very painful experience! It was all a blur, and I am not sure how I got out either, but was badly scraped along the top left side of my thigh, right down to my shin bone and ankle, something I didn't know until later. But, what really hurt was my back. I lay on my side moaning in agony; both children thought I was just pretending, and were laughing at my dramatic sounds! However, when I told them to tell their Dad it was an emergency, that changed fast; they both looked very worried.  Riku went running. Mirei stayed beside me, patting me, and telling me it would be okay. </p>
<p>Lots happened: Bryn sent Riku to his room, where he kept calling down to me from his bedroom window, asking how I was, Mirei was so concerned and sweet, staying right beside me, while Bryn was asking if he could help me up, what he could do, etc. But there was nothing for a good fifteen minutes, as I just could not imagine trying to get up. Finally, he was able to get me into a chair which he brought outside, and things went a little blank and blurry. The cars and roads and trees were all silvery and disappearing, and I felt so dizzy, but that went away after perhaps ten minutes. Finally, Bryn supported me while I hobbled into the house, and sat on the sofa, still moaning and hating to do so in front of the children. </p>
<p>Riku was allowed downsatirs, and stood crying beside me. Poor guy!  I asked if he would read me a story, hoping it would distract him and me, but he cried saying he couldn't and didn't want me to die. I felt awful for Riku; he has seen me hurt once before and that was his concern then too. I reassured him I would be fine in a few days, and Mirei asked why I kept saying "shoot".  :) It wasn't what I wanted to say, believe me! Mirei got a wet tissue and wiped the blood off and cleaned a small cut along the base of my thumb; in Mirei's mind that was my biggest injury. Blood! </p>
<p>Akane and Ayako got home about 2:15, about a half hour after it happened, and Ayako suggested that I get to a hospital even if I felt that nothing was broken. By this time I was just feeling awful and thinking some pain medication would help, if nothing else! After Ayako made a few phone calls, to a few facilities I gather, off we went, arriving at the hospital at 4 P.M. Ayako left us to continue on home to Osaka; she had been so kind, and I appreciated her going out of her way to seek help for me.</p>
<p>I was hurting a lot; I couldn't sit, and I knew I wouldn't be able to stand for long, and the fifteen minutes to get into an examining room seemed forever. It is a big facility, with lots of chairs and sliding office doors where the patients are seen, and it was almost empty from what we could see. However, there may well have been a patient behind each door! It was all very quiet and still. </p>
<p>Akane was there as my translator, and explained what had gone on. The doctor asked a few more questions and then a nurse accompanied us to the X-ray department a few floors up. There was a flat table, but I knew there was no way I was going to be able to get down on that, so they did four or five standing X-rays instead. We waited perhaps fifteen minutes after that, and the nurse gave me a "thumbs-up" as we walked back into the doctor's office. What a nice thing to do, as I was so afraid that I perhaps had crushed vertebrae, and knowing even a few minutes ahead of time that all was well was a huge relief. </p>
<p>Bottom line was that I stretched some back tendons in that hard fall down the hole, and it is going to take some time for it all to heal. I was wrapped in a big wide pressure bandage, which immediately felt like a good firm hug, and helped with the walking immensely! Before the appointment, I had been leaning heavily on Akane, as well as on the nurse's shoulder, and was then able to walk on my own, if carefully. </p>
<p>Akane had talked the doctor into ten pain pills, rather than the five he was originally going to prescribe, so she went off to get those, at the drug store around the corner, and I was happy to use the handicapped bathroom, with low and high rails(!), and even better, the wonderfully warm toilet seat that I fondly remembered from the condo in Osaka, as well as in many of the department stores. I haven't been in even one of those wonderful stores here yet. </p>
<p>The entire cost of all these health services, including the pressure bandage, was a mere $200! I can't begin to imagine what the hospital bill, with four X-rays, would have been in San Francisco. </p>
<p>So, home in a taxi ... the drivers here all wear navy blue uniforms, ties, and gloves, and open and close the door for you. The seats were covered in what to us would seem to be fussy "old lady" lacy but heavy cotton fabric. Funny what one pays attention to when one would rather not be concentrating on not feeling every bump in the road! </p>
<p>It seemed a long way home, but the cab fare was just Y1100, about $11.00, about half or less than I thought it would be. The children were very happy to see me, and both asked lots of questions about how I was feeling and admired my very large "bandage". Mirei kept patting me, rubbing me, and kissing the little scrape on my hand.</p>
<p>School the next day, so tubs with their dad, while Akane whipped up one her delicious dinners, and then somehow they fitted in piano and reading for Riku. It was a very busy couple of hours! </p>
<p>The bandage is making a huge difference in how I feel, and now I just want a good night's sleep. Sitting and standing are no fun at all. Bed at 10:30 p.m. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/hell_day_for_pain_but_buttons.html">Two Walks in the Rain, Pink Brollies, and — Oh Yes — Pain!</a></h2>
								<p>I slept very well last night, thanks to a pain killer and 2 MD sleep capsules. I had gone to bed at 10:30, and was aware of Riku lying awake beside me when it was light. I checked my watch, saw that it was 6:30 and told Riku he could get up and get a book. While he was gone, I glanced at my watch again and it was 5:30! It was so light in the room, that it was hard to believe it was so early but, as always when he wakens too early, Riku was happy lying beside me reading/looking quietly at his book, and a half hour later or so we lay there talking quietly. </p>
<p>Getting off my futon an hour later was not fun!  I am sure I was in the same position all night, on my back for the most part, as moving from one tiny area of one side to the other, a mere inch, just hurt too bloody much! It took me fifteen minutes to get off the three-inch futon and to make my way to the shower area. Most of that time was spent just getting myself over to the door, and then standing up, by grasping hold of the door frame and the end of the wall. </p>
<p>I had a pretty good day, though, much better than I expected to, given that beginning. I started off with a nice long hot shower, dressed slowly, helped with breakfast for Riku and ended up walking him to school as usual, if a bit slower than normal. I really love that time with him, and was able to enjoy the walk in the light drizzle with him, as the ladybugs were out in full swing. There was a group of girls ahead of us in the schoolyard, all three with lovely pink umbrellas, and I stopped to take a photo of them. I felt better when I got home and think the slow walk was a good idea. </p>
<p>I had my egg and toast, and Mirei and I had some hot chocolate too, while we listened to the songs on Akane's computer that Doug had sent for the children. Later on, we went for a nice stroll in the light rain, just to get out of the house together. Mirei insisted on taking along her backpack, reassuring me that she would carry it herself, as I told her I couldn't today, and she did too. She did look funny with it under her raincoat, though! </p>
<p>We did our usual walk, up to and past the bakery, stopping to see if they had a little pizza for Mirei's lunch (they didn't). Before going into the grocery store, just to poke around, I took a photo of a cigarette machine, as it has been years since we had them in North America. We paused for a moment on the way home to see if the "snowman" lady was out. Of course she wasn't, with the rain, but Mirei posed for me beside her gate.We both admired the small broom hanging there, one we have seen her use to sweep her sidewalk. </p>
<p>We were out for a whole hour, much to my surprise, but I was ready to sit once we got home. We had lunch together, and then Mirei and I sat on the sofa reading a nice little stack of books. She would pop off the sofa, get hold of two or three, put them back, choose two more, and on it went. When we ran out of books downstairs, I showed her some family videos on the computer, as she so enjoys seeing her cousins, not to mention herself, when she was really little. </p>
<p>Mirei kept herself busy combing my hair, zipping my fleece jacket up and down, and giving me lots of kisses. She is perfectly capable of finding things to do and is never bored. </p>
<p>Bryn had gone off late in the morning to work at the café, and came home a few hours later with a new bike! Akane had given him directions earlier on how to get to a couple of bike shops, and he was quite taken with a used folding bike. He was very proud of it and showed it off to Mirei and me; it's in great condition and he is looking forward to zipping off to cafes further afield. </p>
<p>Akane met Riku after school for his piano lesson, and then they were home for our usual evening routine. The children watched a children's program on TV for the first time since it arrived on Monday, and had their baths before dinner. </p>
<p>Just after dinner, while I was trying to help with the kitchen cleanup, the pain really set in again with a wallop. It hit me out of nowhere, it seemed, and I was close to crying. I think it's worse because I have never had back problems, and so move in ways that I shouldn't without thinking! </p>
<p>Getting up off the bed again after reading to Riku and lying beside him until he was asleep required help from Bryn. I called up to him in his office, after trying myself for ten minutes, and thank goodness he heard me. Akane had fallen asleep with Mirei, and I would have been stuck there for a while. I got to the door but just could not pull myself up. I can understand why people in extreme pain just want it to be over! Childbirth for both my children hurt less than this, and only lasted seven hours in total too. Given the choice ... yup, I would pick childbirth. </p>
<p>I sat at a chair at the table, with a cushion under me, and one behind my back, writing my blog and checking my emails with a nice hot bed buddy on my lower back. I took my pain pill — I have no idea what they are, but only have enough for two more days — and took Bryn up on a generous shot of his very expensive Johnny Walker whiskey with water. I refused a drink of this the first week I was here, and didn't enjoy the tiny taste of it I sampled one bit. But tonight I was willing to try anything at all, and it went down just fine. I went to bed when the pain had subsided, about 10:30, feeling much more relaxed. </p>
<p>p.s. I took a photo of two packages of carrots Akane had picked up. Two short but fat carrots in each bag, for a total of just over $2.00. They're expensive, but sweet and delicious. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/the_pain_continues_but_that_mi.html">That Mirei ... aka Florence Nightingale, but Florence with a Wardrobe!</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke this morning at 1 A.M. to use the bathroom, and it was a half hour of pure agony between getting up and getting back down to my futon on the floor. In between it took at least ten minutes to slide off the futon and get to the bedroom door (about three feet in total!), and then another ten to get up off the floor.Getting to the bathroom was the third, and last, ten minutes of this painful trip. Man! I hurt! </p>
<p>The shade we used for the first time in our room last night is just amazing. The room is full of daylight from 5 A.M. on, and Riku has been awaking anytime from half past five on the last few days, but at 6:45 this morning he was still sleeping soundly. </p>
<p>I managed to get to the doorway, and then called quietly to Bryn (who was in the kitchen) to help  me up, not willing to do this again on my own, unless I had no choice. Gee, I was up and standing within seconds!</p>
<p>He gently woke Riku, with a quiet "good morning", and of course Mirei went bouncing in, full of vim and vigour; Riku wasn't quite ready for that level of morning cheer! He had slept for almost two extra hours, and I am so sorry we didn't know that the window shades were on all the windows in the house, except the sliding doors. They're a protection against typhoons, and almost everyone has them in this area. I love them! </p>
<p>I hobbled into the shower area, and let the hot water pour down my back. My nightie fell onto the floor and got soaked, but there was no way I could reach down to rescue it. Bryn had given me the prescription pain pill first, but I honestly do not think they are working for me. I just felt helpless, and was near tears for the first hour after waking. </p>
<p>Mirei was such a darling. I called her into the bathroom to help me with my underwear and socks! I just could not bend that far, so she squatted down and put them all at floor level, so I could step into them, and of course I could manage once she got them up to about my knees. She was so efficient with the socks ... asked me where the heel should be on her hands, and turned them perfectly, so that when she was facing me the heel was in the right position! And all the while, she kept assuring me "You will be OK, Nana" and "You will get better, Nana." and of course I will, but I want it to be today! </p>
<p>I decided it would be better not to walk Riku to school today, much to my chagrin, as it is only the second day I have missed since arriving five weeks ago. But I had no idea how long it would take us to do that twenty-minute walk the way I was feeling. He went off to school with Akane, waving goodbye from the gate. </p>
<p>I didn't know what to do to get comfortable. Sitting hurt too much, standing did as well, and I certainly couldn't lie down! Every time Mirei looked at my face, she made a comment.. "Are you okay, Nana?", "Let me check your hand; is it getting better? Let me kiss it.", worried still about the very superficial small scrape on that hand(!), and "Oh, it's getting better now!" </p>
<p>What a very sweet little girl she is, running to get me anything I needed at all ... my water bottle, a blanket, "the orange pillow or the green one? The orange one is nice and hot (from the bed buddy) and the green one is nice and cool." All that attention and kisses too. I am one lucky woman! I hope she's around in another thirty years! </p>
<p>I finally made myself a little "nest" on the sofa, with folded duvets, and two pillows, and got some heat behind my lower back with the bed buddy. That felt pretty good, and even more so after I took two of the 222s (acetaminophen with codeine) I bought in Canada, and luckily have with me! I found them tucked into a corner of my kit bag. Mirei suggested "Just relax, Nana." and "Just sit back and close your eyes; you will feel better soon." and I did indeed. We had about two hours of nesting/reading/photo-shooting/playing time on the big wide sofa. Akane kindly cooked up a perfectly fried egg and grainy toast for me, and a big cup of hot chocolate too, all of which I was ready for once the pain had eased.</p>
<p>It will be such fun to see the photos Mirei took of me and of us, as it was quite a long photo shoot! She is just at the stage where she likes to make really silly faces and then checks them out immediately, so she can howl when she does so. What a funny little girl she is. I can't imagine not seeing her for so long, as she changes every single day, and not just her clothes! </p>
<p>Akane brought her computer over to the sofa for me, and while Mirei was upstairs changing clothes, a habit she has cultivated since having access to lots of new clothes in her room right now, I managed to answer emails from friends and family. I dozed off now and then too, much to my surprise, but it shows me how much more relaxed I am! Mirei wandered in and out of the living room, getting up to snuggle with me, and then getting off to tend to her babies, or find another bag to stuff blankets and animals into. She had time for some drawing too, as I found her lying on my futon in the bedroom at one point. </p>
<p>At 1 P.M. Akane and Mirei left the house, with Mirei wearing her new summery black cotton dress with bunnies on it, a black bolero type sweater over it, and sadly reduced to just one tiny pink bunny purse (and not the big pink "packback" and pink cloth bag as well). "I won't be tired! I will carry them myself!" but Mommy won, and off they went for lunch, and a little time away from the house.  </p>
<p>Bryn went off on his new bike to a distant café, and Riku came roaring in the house at 1:50, having walked home on his own again. He declined a snack (they eat lunch and are then dismissed), but told me he would let me know when he's hungry. </p>
<p>He was playing on his own in his room, and I heard some calling out from his window to outside the house.Yuu-kun and another boy were out there, and were inviting him to go to the other boy's house. He is also a grade one student, although also not in Riku's class. I told Riku he needed to find out if the mother was home, and so off they ran. I put on my jacket and walked over to the house, just around the corner, to make sure there was someone home and to make sure she knew about the plan. Riku and I had seen this little boy turn into the driveway for his home back when I was picking him up, so I knew just where to go.The mom was very friendly, and even spoke a little English, so I was able to ask her to send Riku home at 4 P.M. for his piano practice. That gave the three boys almost two hours to play. Fifteen minutes later he was home to grab his Pokemon cards, and ran back over to show to show them his little collection. Just before the deadline he was home, a happy boy. </p>
<p>Akane made okonomiyaki for dinner, with a vegetarian version for me. It was delicious, and the children finished up quickly so they could watch "Doraemon". This character, an ear-less cat, is a Japanese comic book icon, who became even more popular once animated and shown on TV. It's Friday and they were allowed to stay up later tonight for a treat. </p>
<p>Mirei, again like Caillie, has a hard time merely sitting and watching anything for too long on the tv, so in between what caught her attention. Mirei and Bryn shared some silly time together. She was sitting on her Dad's lap, taking turns with him imitating her as she posed, fingers to face, and head cocked in one direction or another, and then she imitating her daddy. I took three or four sets of photos in all, which I will get up in an album once I am back home. Soooo cute! Then it was the usual bedtime routine, a little more rushed than usual as it was later than normal.</p>
<p>I had decided to sleep on the sofa tonight, after reading online that the worst thing one could do for stretched tendons and/or pulled muscles was to bend at all, and certainly not to be getting up and down from a floor. So a decision was made to have Riku sleep in his own bed on his own. He likes snuggling with me, and having a warm body in his bed at night, as he is used to it, but he was such a good sport about this. Mirei would be in with her parents as usual. A little bribe helped too; he was promised a trip to the toy store with his dad tomorrow afternoon, if he made it through the night without calling out. </p>
<p>We read the second last chapter of our book in his bed ("We're almost there, Nana!"), and I turned off the light to snuggle with him for a bit, and woke up two hours later! Egad! Getting out of Riku's low bed is not easy either, especially when my back has tightened up with lying there.  </p>
<p>Earlier in the day, I had a "hit" on my Ancestry tree about my mom's paternal grandfather and had been looking forward to answering the gal who wrote to me, and putting in the new (for us) information. But those two hours of sleep did away with that plan! I did manage to write to her, but was anxious to get to bed.</p>
<p>Bryn helped me set up the sofa with two duvets and pillows, and my little nighttime nest on the sofa looked very inviting by the time I was ready to tuck in. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/piggies_playground_and_buttons.html">A Surprise Breakfast, Piggies, Playground, and Buttons!</a></h2>
								<p>I slept well again last night, with just one too-long trip to the bathroom in the night. Finding the toilet seat <strong>down</strong>, once I made it there, almost had me in tears, as bending down that low to lift it just seemed like too much to ask. Crazy! My back stiffens right up and lifting myself, even while holding on to the arms of the sofa, just has me sweating buckets. Oy vey! I shall give thanks every day for a healthy back, as soon as it is back to normal. I guess not ever having had back problems has spoiled me for being able to move quickly and in whatever direction I choose! </p>
<p>Darling Riku came downstairs at 6:30 this morning. He told me he had been in his room "thinking", waiting for 6:30, which is a shame, as I too had been lying there listening for any quiet footsteps upstairs. He went right into the kitchen today to make me a "surprise"; I could hear the fridge door opening and closing, and he quietly went to the hutch and took out a bowl, and headed back to the kitchen. Not much later, he came in proudly bearing a bowl of fresh fruit for me. What a lucky Nana I am! I was so touched; what a kind thing to do this was, and all his own idea too. </p>
<p>Bryn went out for breakfast at 7:30, to work at his café again today, and the morning flew by. I stayed on the sofa for a while, with both children buzzing about me. The children played so well together, with Mirei changing clothes like an Oscar winner attending a dozen parties. Riku, being her official "dresser", announced her entrance. "Ladies and gentlemen! Here is Queen Elizabeth!" It was hilarious, and they kept busy for so long entertaining each other.</p>
<p>When Riku went off for some quiet time on his own, Mirei entertained me, kissing my hand, making sure I was comfortable, sitting beside me with all her bags and backpacks, and ribbons and bows, and chatting up a storm. She reminds me of Caillie, more and more so. She combed my hair carefully, I put her hair in "piggies" again today, and then while they ate the rest of their breakfast I took a long hot shower and felt much better after that. </p>
<p>By 11 A.M. it was time for some fresh air. It was a gorgeous day, and Riku wanted to play with somebody. We walked over to the child's house around the corner (where Riku had played yesterday), but were told by a neighbour that he and his family were out for a bike ride. We came back home to collect Mirei. Bryn had just arrived home, Akane was heading out to run errands, and off we went, stopping to pick up Yuu-kun.</p>
<p>The boys walked ahead of us, waiting at the corners until the last block. They went racing up the steps, as did Mirei, until she noticed me lagging behind. She walked back down to me, gently took my hand, and told me she would help me, with the most concerned expression on her face. "It's okay, Nana. You will feel better soon." Sweet girl. </p>
<p>There were only two children there, a brother and a sister, and not too long after we arrived, they were all checking out all the bugs they could find. Two women came, one to cut the other's hair, so that totally fascinated the children for about ten minutes. Soon another boy came on his own, and there was Frisbee playing, running and chasing, dashes up and down the slide, and more bug searching. Mirei sat for the longest time at the side of the sandbox, playing with two little girls who had arrived later. I wasn't comfortable sitting or standing, and was happy to be on the way home again an hour and a bit later. Akane was on her way out and Bryn was just arriving home. </p>
<p>My back felt close to spasm (I was so uncomfortable at the playground, not being able to stand for long, and not happy trying to get up and down for the fairly low bench either), and I was hurting too much when we got home. Bryn made grilled cheese sandwiches for the children with lots of veggies while I put my feet up. I haven't had much of an appetite since my fall, and am not even interested in all my big cups of milky tea either. After a while though, I did eat a nice big portion of a soba noodle, cabbage, and other veggie soup I had made the other day. </p>
<p>It was a gorgeous day, and Akane did three loads of laundry. I have hung up my last clothing for this trip, as there is no way I can navigate down to the two cement blocks from the sliding glass door any longer. However, Riku and Mirei sorted the clothes into each of our piles ... laughing at my bra(!), and everyone's underwear ... all very funny obviously! Mirei stuck to it and helped by handing her mom every piece of laundry until the job was done. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn were in and out on various errands, but once home got started on the usual list of things to do. Riku's hair was getting long, and I was hoping to see it cut before going home. I love his hair fairly short. Since he was too hot and sweaty while playing the piano, Akane cut his hair herself for the first time in a long time (he had been going to my hair cutter in San Francisco for the past few cuts). She set up his chair so that he could watch  "Night at the Museum", which of course was nice for him, but not so easy to cut his hair with all the laughing and trying to see the screen as well. He has such thick hair and we all laughed at all the hair on his back, telling him he looked just like his Grandpa and his great-grandpa too, my dad. I like hairy men and Riku knows this, but it looked like it must have tickled like mad! </p>
<p>Bryn showered with Riku, and then set off with him to a toy store to choose a special toy for his night on his own. They left at 4:40, with plans to meet up with Akane and Mirei at 5:30 for dinner out. I declined to go with them, as I couldn't imagine climbing up and down on a bus or even having to stay in one position for long, especially if it were at a chair-less spot, as is typical here of many of their favourite restaurants.</p>
<p>I had a little quiet time first, though, with Mirei, which was very nice at the end of my day with her. We went outside and blew bubbles for a half hour; we both had a great time! She would blow lots of them and at one point I said "There are a million of them!" and after that she would say it too any time she blew more than a dozen of them. Nice little video of this too. </p>
<p>She has been practicing over and over and over yesterday and today undoing and doing up the buttons on the blouses she was wearing, and must have said to me in a big voice three times in an hour "Look Nana! I can do my buttons all by myself!". She is so proud of herself and should be too; she's been working hard at this. After this, she was unbuttoning and buttoning buttons whenever and wherever she could, just to keep in practice! </p>
<p>She and Akane left at 5:20 for the bus, and I got busy immediately on the computer, catching up on older blogs that Bryn has attached photos to already. It took me a while to get my little comfort zone perfect ... two thin pillows on the seat, one thick one behind my back, and a heating pad tucked in between. Not hungry for dinner,  I did treat myself to a small cup of hot chocolate and a piece of yummy whole grain toast at 8:30. </p>
<p>The time passed very quickly, and at 7:20 the family walked in the door. They had dessert, did the bedtime routine, but of course had their showers/tubs earlier, Mirei got to wear her sunny new yellow pineapple PJs and looked adorable; Riku had new PJs too, watched a little big of TV, but was tired and more than ready for his bed. </p>
<p>We read the book about Galileo again; he was asleep late though, not being able to settle in the hot night, and finally succumbed at close to 9, with that darned glowing light still. Bryn took it down and placed it face down on Mirei's bed; Akane is mystified as to why there is a light that doesn't turn off! I was too uncomfortable tonight to fall asleep, which was a good thing for which my back was grateful.</p>
<p>Akane and Bryn were online, searching for bookcases and wall units during the evening, and I was just too sore to walk up the stairs to Bryn's computer or to even think about asking him to bring it down. Bryn helped me make up my bed very early, crawled in and read a bit, wrote a few blog notes, and dozed off and on for a bit in between. Bryn left at ten to go for a drink, just a five minute walk away, his first night out since they moved in. I was vaguely aware of him standing in the doorway some time later.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/happy_mothers_day_1.html">Happy Mother's Day!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku was downstairs at 6:30 again this morning, although was sad because he had called to his dad in the night, and Bryn ended up sleeping with him. I'm sure in a way that was nice for him, but he is taking great pride in sleeping on his own and no doubt was disappointed with himself on some level too. We can't snuggle on the sofa until after I get up, as there is just no room, but he happily went off busying himself in the kitchen again, and of course I guessed that he was making me my fruit bowl again, as he asked me not to peek. I snuggled back under the duvet, and could hear Akane and Mirei in the kitchen with him. I know he wanted to do this on his own, but Akane helped him put some yogurt into a bowl for my tray. He came walking in to the living room, bearing it proudly with Mirei beside him, smiling away at their surprise. A lovely way to start off Mother's Day indeed! </p>
<p>Riku got busy immediately, drawing a lovely picture for Akane, and Bryn was upstairs doing something mysterious with paper and pencil crayons too. Mirei told me it was a surprise. Shhhh. Soon he came down bearing a homemade card for me, an old tradition and one I hold dearly in my heart. I have all the cards my children have made for me over the years. Lucky me! </p>
<p>I took a long hot steamy shower today while Bryn and Akane fed the children, and they kept busy with paper and glue and bits of paper. </p>
<p>Just before 9 o'clock Bryn and Akane went off on their bikes to the doctor's clinic as Bryn had an appointment to have his sinus problem rechecked. He has been suffering with this since before I arrived, and it was a problem in San Francisco for him too. He doesn't say much, but it sure takes its toll on Bryn's comfort level. </p>
<p>Just after 11 o'clock Bryn and I headed off to brunch together, just the two of us, on the bus. Last night Akane had phoned a vegetarian restaurant specializing in tofu, one of my very favourite foods, and ordered what she thought would be a special meal for me. We got there a little bit early, so Bryn was able to tell me and show me about the special group of shops that the restaurant was part of ... traditional Kyoto stores, with storefronts and the owner's homes set in behind. This set of five or six had been carefully renovated and housed a number of very nice little restaurants ... Italian, Japanese, and the one we were going to. </p>
<p>It was very special. Akane and Bryn both thought it would be a good spot for me as they have tables set down into the floor so that one can sit with one's legs in a pit, and not kneeling as is more traditional in many eating places here, even casual ones. I could not have managed that at all, and Bryn had to help me back to a standing position at the end of our meal. I was very comfortable throughout the meal, though, and enjoyed every single bite of it. </p>
<p>I was a bit surprised when the tray first arrived, as there was a bowl of soup with one of the partially cooked eggs on top, something I just cannot handle. However, Bryn knew that Akane had changed that course for me, and had the tray passed over to him instead. Whew! This was just a wonderful meal, from the soup through all the mysterious and various tofu dishes, to the really yummy soft tofu "crème caramel". I could happily have eaten two of them, even though it was a generous portion! The service was perfect, with both women who served us being very warm and friendly. We enjoyed the traditional smoky Kyoto tea with our meal as well. </p>
<p>Bryn is a big fan of American-styled coffee shops, built in the early 1950s when there were a lot of American servicemen in Japan, rebuilding after the war. In the States we have many remakes of these coffee shops ... "Johnny Rocket's" is a big one, but I know there are others around too. They're spanking new, but the ones here are the originals, which means they are somewhat grungy, smell of over fifty years of heavy cigarette smoke, well soaked into the velvety cushions, set into dark wood. The low ceilings with hanging lamps, the banquette seating and the old linoleum floors complete the ambiance. Even though Bryn is not a big fan of the smoke-infused air, he loves the whole set-up. It's real, authentic, and he thinks it won't be too long before they start tearing these places down. I chose to go for tea in one he has been to before, just a block or two walk away, and it was just what I expected. The air hit me hard though; it's been a long time since I have walked into an eating area that smelled quite so dense with tobacco! I had tea, Bryn had coffee, and I snuck a couple of photos of the side/back view of an elderly man sitting at the booth behind Bryn. How I wished I could have just boldly walked up to him and asked if I could take his photo. He looked like someone out of a Japanese movie with his small pony tail, his wonderful soft gray pants, covered with a classically gorgeous long soft jacket/shirt top, and with soft black cloth slipper/shoes. I couldn't see his face until he and his family got up to leave, but it was more interesting than I was expecting it to be. </p>
<p>Akane and I had gone to a wonderful French bakery a few weeks ago, and it was very close by. Bryn hadn't been, but of course we had told him about it, so we walked there to pick up some bread. Edith Piaf was still singing, and the same friendly woman was taking care of the shop. Bryn bought some pain au levain and another loaf of some kind, and insisted on taking a photo of me outside, with my fingers held up in the "traditional" peace sign that so many people, especially the children, automatically make when a camera is pointed at them. </p>
<p>Back at home, the children and I took a stroll for ice cream at the nearby 7/11 store. Riku wanted a toy rather than ice cream (he's not a big fan, just as his cousin Bryn wasn't at his age either), but it didn't take much to persuade him that he might like the same frozen treat that Mirei had chosen. I had them wait until they got home to eat it, as it was a hot day and I knew it would be a big mess on the slow walk home. However, I could feel my own chocolate frozen bar was getting soft fast, so I attempted to eat mine while walking and had to change my top when I got in: it had dripped all the way down the front! The children both thought that was <strong>very</strong> funny! </p>
<p>After eating their own cones, Riku went upstairs on his own for some time in his room, while Mirei asked if she could check out my makeup bag. I gave her permission and sat totally intrigued watching her add lipstick with no mirror, eye shadow, eyebrow pencil and blush to those already rosy cheeks! It was adorable, and such a fun thing to observe. </p>
<p>While Akane got dinner for the children, Riku read "Adele and Simon" to me and Mirei. He had done his piano by that point, and had finished writing his twenty-five English spelling words with Bryn, and we had time for a few stories, while Mirei half listened and played on the sofa beside us. </p>
<p>Bryn showered with both children before dinner as well; it's a treat for them to be in the big bath area together, and while I was there I tended to bath the children separately as it made for a more relaxing time for them both. </p>
<p>Kelly sent me a lovely "Happy Mother's Day!" message from a friend's iPhone, as she was out of town for a Creative Memories weekend. Nice relaxing Mother's Day for her too, and she suggested we have a long talk once I get home. </p>
<p>I wasn't hungry at all, and asked Bryn to make me up a fruit and veggie plate. He did a great(!) job on it, and it was just what my body was craving. I sat on the sofa with some magazines while the children ate, and smiled watching Mirei getting a ride on her daddy's leg and dancing about the living room. </p>
<p>Bedtime followed, with both children asleep before 8 o'clock, and then it was time for Bryn to take Akane out for dinner for her Mother's Day treat. I worked on the computer until they got home; they hadn't managed to get into the place they had hoped to, as it was booked solid for Mother's Day, not something they had expected at all. However, they had a quiet evening out and enjoyed it. </p>
<p>Akane helped me get out the duvets out and the pillows and soon after I was tucked into bed. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/monday_only_seven_days_before.html">Monday ... Hot!, First Homework, Bugs, and Mirei Hurting ...</a></h2>
								<p>And the saga continues; all was well until that dreaded "getting up to the bathroom in the night" routine. Foolishly, wanting to "save" the pain meds I have left, I decided to sleep without them. I didn't realize how much I needed them for just getting up once, but boy, my body let me know it. Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! I did get back to sleep, though, after taking them, and Riku opened my door at 6:30, happy to see me awake. </p>
<p>He was a proud boy today, as he didn't call out once. Bryn heard him make a noise at one point, and went into the room to find Riku sitting up in bed. However, he lay right down again and slept through on his own. Big transition for someone who has had someone in his bed at some point for every night of his life. He told me he woke up at 6 o'clock, made his bed, and tidied up his room until it was time to come down. What a guy! </p>
<p>Sunshine Mirei made her entrance not too much later, in her bright yellow PJs and a big sunny smile. Sometimes she is grumpy when she first awakens, but it doesn't take much to get her on her way to her usual self. Immediate protein helps immensely on those days. "Get some food into that girl!" says her dad. </p>
<p>Riku helped himself to a banana first thing today, so he must have been hungry, and I made up their fruit bowls, sitting with them at the table while they ate. They like to have company, of course, and I was happy to sit and let the parents do the rest of the breakfast routine. </p>
<p>Mirei was in bright pink today, looking as summery as the day feels. She had a few minutes to admire herself in the mirror, looking this way and that way, and making different expressions at herself too, not all of them attractive! She likes to make not only others laugh, but herself too, and I guess practicing this helps in both cases. Akane and Bryn went off to Osaka, by bus and train, to look at storage units and bookcases. They dropped Mirei at school at 9, and continued on their way. </p>
<p>Riku and I left for school at our usual time, didn't see our regular smiling neighbour today, which disappointed both of us, but saw lots of friendly faces on our way.I snapped a photo of the unicycles on the way out, and wonder if the school perhaps owns them. </p>
<p>I walked home more slowly than usual, and saw the kind man in his garden who had given me the cabbage last week. He bowed, and I bowed, and we both exchanged morning greetings. </p>
<p>I sat with heat on my back, emailing, and then had a long phone call from Gail, after eating an egg and toast, the first morning breakfast I have felt like eating in a few days. I caught up on all the news from home ... Paul is coughing horribly and waiting to see his doctor about the two or three growths they have found in his left lung, Beth is understandably stressed out, and Uncle Frank, after six weeks in the hospital, sat up today, and is on a soft food diet. Candy and Rick are in Niagara Falls for Lisa's 70th birthday party, and for some support for all those needing it there. Busy days in Ontario, and worrisome too. If I hadn't hurt my back, I would be planning a trip there a few days after going home.</p>
<p>I got some blogging done, and then did some housework before Riku arrived home at 1:45: dishes, sweeping, and thoroughly cleaning the kitchen counters. At one point I could hear the sound of children outdoors, unusual at this time of day, and got out there in time to see a big group out for a walk with their nursery school teachers. </p>
<p>Just as I was about to slip on my sandals to peek out for Riku, he came bursting through the door, announcing that he walked all the way from the lights on his own. Was he hot! Sweat was dripping from his scalp and face; that haircut came just in the nick of time. </p>
<p>He plunked himself down on the floor in the hallway, took off his socks, and dumped out his school bag, anxious to show me the school photo taken the day before school officially started. He is front and centre in the photo, and his mom, dad, and grandmother are in the photo too. I'm hoping for a copy ... </p>
<p>I have been asking for a few days if he had any homework and the answer has always been "no". Today I didn't ask, and so Riku of course got to tell me he did. </p>
<p>He sat at the table for ten minutes, drinking cold juice, after I had wiped him down with a cool cloth ... on his face, neck, arms, hands, and even his armpits, which made him laugh but that he obviously enjoyed. The house stays cool, though, and so he went up to his room to putter about on his own as usual. He had a cool bowl of mixed fruit, sitting on the edge of the patio door, with the white curtains blowing out behind him. He looked so relaxed and I took a few photos while he was sitting there thinking. </p>
<p>Eventually he made his way outdoors to hunt for and inspect bugs, one of his favourite things to do anywhere at all. He sat eating the rest of his cold fruit salad on the doorstep, with a lovely breeze blowing the curtains around him. I took lots of photos as he was quite the picture sitting there, contemplating his next bug move. </p>
<p>I loved having this quiet time alone with him, as I know only too well how long it will be before I have it again ... and then he'll be a seven-year-old and changed in ways I haven't witnessed. It makes me sad. </p>
<p>I knew he would be a busy boy with all his normal activities, once his parents came home, so I coaxed him into reading with me on the sofa, with bottles of cold water on hand for us, and in exchange I would listen as he walked me through his borrowed book from school, based on the movie they watched on the weekend: "Cats Return". He did a super job explaining in great detail what was going on, who the bad cats were, and who the friends — aka "good guys" — were. The drawings are wonderfully done, and it was fun sitting next to Riku while he translated from the Japanese to me. </p>
<p>At 4:45 we decided to walk to the bus stop to meet Mirei and her parents. There is a point at which Bryn likes to walk one way, and Akane another, so we found a spot where we would see them no matter which way they came. Along the way we stopped to say "hello" to Mirei's "snowman" lady. It was the very first time Riku has met her, so that was fun. Riku decided we should hide, and just peek at the buses as they went by, to see if we could spot them first, but we waited and waited and waited, in a shady spot though, to no avail, and gave up at 5:15. </p>
<p>I did take a couple of photos on that hot walk, though: one of a very tiny fresh produce shop with bamboo poles leaning against the store front to keep it cool, and another of the main business street, where Riku and I were waiting to spot the #19 bus. </p>
<p>We were happy to be back in the cool house. Akane, Bryn, and Mirei arrived home at 5:40, having run some errands after picking up Mirei, so the evening was a little more rushed than would have been ideal. Bryn prepared a pizza for the children with lots of veggies, a standard fast meal, and one that both children enjoy,</p>
<p>Bryn showered with Riku making it extra fast, but Mirei had hurt her forearm somehow during dinner, and was whimpering in pain. Poor wee girl; it isn't often she hurts, and I had her sit with her hand on a pillow, moving it gently to see how much and where it hurt. It was so tender and she flinched with any movement at all. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn discussed taking her to the doctor, but she was so tired and would have had to walk many blocks, and likely wait a while to be seen, so instead her dad showered with her very gently after she took some children's Tylenol, and before it was her bedtime, not much later, she was moving her arm comfortably. Phew! We shall see how it is in the morning. </p>
<p>A rare day ... no spelling or piano for Riku. No time! He did do his homework, though, with Akane, and it took less than a minute I think, as it was very basic and easy math for him. He had been doing much harder math than that at Starr King, but this is the first year for the children here. </p>
<p>My back was telling me there was no way it could get down onto Riku's bed for story time; I was not happy missing out on this time at the end of his day, but his daddy tucked him in, and Riku was asleep at 8:15. Bryn went to bed at 9(!) tonight, Akane was on her computer, and so I sat making notes in my "bed" until just past 11 P.M. Here's to a better night! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/observation_period_lady_bugs_b.html">Observation Class With Riku, Lady Bugs Bite!, Mirei the Entertainer, and Cherries Too!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku was very quiet walking to school today, with lots on his mind, really had to make an effort to smile at our favourite lady, and wasn't interested in engaging in conversation with a friendly man walking his dog, a man determined to talk to Riku and finally succeeding.</p>
<p>We spotted a heron on the edge of the water, and talked about nesting, and eggs, and food for the water birds. Finally, just as I was leaving him at school, Riku told me they had planted flowers in pots outside their classroom windows. He wanted me to see them, so I walked outside to the back of the class, and saw all the little pots filled with soil and upturned water bottles. Leaning out the window, Riku pointed to his, and several other children came to join him. I took a couple of shots of happy smiling children, including our little guy. </p>
<p>I walked slowly home, taking a few photos of the school again, with the freshly planted vegetable gardens in the foreground, and then walked along the river for a few blocks as well. I wasn't quite ready to head home. I took some photos of another heron on her nest. It was a lovely morning, and I enjoyed the quiet time and the fresh air. I was feeling so much better than yesterday morning, and am so grateful that I am healing more quickly than I expected to be.</p>
<p>It's a blowy hot day, and I put one load of wash in, and got that out on the line after all, by walking along a narrow path at the side of the house, thus avoiding the impossible-to-get-down (at the moment) cement blocks from the dining room. I thought I wouldn't be helping with any more laundry, until I realized there was a way around it. I got a second load ready to hang out too, and managed to do it before leaving the house later on. I even did up the dishes, although my back was letting me know that enough was enough by that time! </p>
<p>Akane came back home right after dropping Mirei off; she was on her computer, so I got busy sending off some birthday/post cards, while Akane booked my door-to-door shuttle for Monday. This is a bargain; only $40.00  for the  trip ... no bus (or taxi), no train, no transfer to another train to the airport, and it might even be cheaper. I am booked for pick-up at 12:30 Monday, and since I will need help lifting my case and the one box I will be taking with me, Akane booked a porter service as well. There may be red-caps there, but neither Bryn nor Akane are sure of this, and at $4.00 per piece, this too is a bargain. Nice to have that all taken care of and not be worrying about how I will manage. I am particularly happy that Bryn won't have to spend hours of his day off travelling all that way with me. </p>
<p>Akane was also trying to get me in to see a doctor again, if only to get more pain meds for the trip. However, as cheap as it is to be treated here, it can be very time consuming. The best plan seemed to be to go to the hospital tomorrow, where they have my records, so that X-rays didn't need to be retaken (which I wouldn't have wanted to do anyway). But to go there meant getting to the hospital at 7:30 to get a number, waiting until the clinic opens at 8:30, and then — since it is such a busy place — waiting possibly two or three hours, Akane said, to be seen. It's all complicated by Mirei being in school, and Akane needing to be there to pick her up at noon tomorrow (not the usual 4 P.M.), and of course my needing Akane at the hospital as a translator! It's all too involved, and I decided later in the evening that I would try to get by on fewer pain meds in the next few days and stockpile some for that flight home. I am feeling better as well, and in six more days ... I might not need them at all! </p>
<p>I made a yummy brunch of sauteed tomatoes, scrambled eggs, two small slices of delicious grainy toast, and a big cup of tea. Mom would have enjoyed it as much as I did! Tasted like home, when I was a child ... comfort food for sure.</p>
<p>Akane and Bryn went out for lunch together, and to run some errands, and so I sat with a heat pack on my back and typed away like mad. </p>
<p>Today there is a second monthly 45-minute class open to the parents and relatives of the grade one classes, and I was delighted to be here for this again. Akane and Bryn arrived home, and we were ready to leave together for school. However, I set out on my own, to walk at my own slower pace, and met them at the door at 2:45. </p>
<p>I could see Riku searching for us in the sea of faces, and he broke into a big smile when he met my eyes. We were lucky enough to get the same spot at the back of his class, leaning against a counter, as we did the last time, and this gave me a great vantage point for taking photos and videos of Riku and the class. </p>
<p>Today they were learning to identify which row was where ... second row from the left, third row from the right, etc. and when the teacher called it out, the children had to point to the row she was referring to. It was loud! So was the "bingo" style game with numbers, but the children had a great time with it all. </p>
<p>I like the teacher very much. She is energetic, tolerant, obviously enjoys her job, and keeps the children focused and interested. Riku sits in the front row of the second aisle from the door, and I think it's a great spot for him. He is more likely to be engaged in what is going on if he's there in front; he's a dreamer and that would be easier in the middle of the classroom. He likes his desk-mate too, a six-year-old girl.</p>
<p>The teacher really impressed me when Riku pointed out a spider crawling between his and his desk-mate's desks. She picked it up carefully, walked over to the window with it, and let it go. She got an A+ from me for that move. </p>
<p>We started our walk toward the bridge together, with Akane and Bryn ahead of us with their umbrellas, to shade them from the hot sun, and Riku and I holding hands walking along looking for ladybugs. Riku picked one up and, much to his surprise a bit later, it bit him! I have never had this happen to me, ever, and Riku was not pleased. He has decided that perhaps ladybugs are no longer his favourite insect. </p>
<p>We split up after the walk across the bridge, as Riku has a 45-minute Chinese class on Wednesday afternoons, and Bryn was heading home to leave to pick Mirei up at 4 P.M. Akane and Riku went off to the bus, and I walked with Bryn.</p>
<p>We were both very glad to be in the house, as it is a hot day again. After Bryn left, I got the second load of laundry in from the line and folded, and then sat down with a very achy back and a hot pack, after taking my first pain pill of the day. At that point, going without meds didn't seem to be a plan that will work. It's frustrating as, except for the pain, I am so much more mobile than I was. </p>
<p>Bryn came walking in with Mirei at 4:45, dressed in the sweetest little black cotton dress, looking like a little French maid. Bryn and I had such a wonderful hour or so with her. She was feeling silly ... no surprise there(!), and insisted that I take lots of photos of her making faces, so she could instantly look at them, laugh out loud at them, and then insist on yet another silly pose. What a girl this is! </p>
<p>There is a sweetness to Mirei as well, though. I had cooked up the last of the pasta, along with some veggies for Mirei's dinner, and there wasn't quite enough for the three of us (Riku and Akane had dinner out). Bryn insisted that I have the portion left after we served Mirei's, and Mirei asked "How about you, Daddy?" He asked what she meant, and she answered "What are you going to eat for <strong>your</strong> dinner?" He assured her he would be fine, and in fact ended up eating the last of her pasta, since she had a very generous and healthy snack before dinner. She must have been so thirsty on this hot day, as I swear she drank a quart of liquids between getting home and bedtime. </p>
<p>Bryn showered/tubbed with Mirei after dinner, and how I loved hearing them laughing and chatting in the shower. It's right off the kitchen and with a folding door so it's easy to hear all that's going on. He shampoos her hair, and talks to her all the way through the water routine; it's adorable. She was all ready for bed at 6:30, with her bright yellow jammies on, and her hair combed out, when Akane and Riku walked in. </p>
<p>I was sitting on the sofa when Riku came into the living room, and he was so excited and just had to show me something right away: fresh cherries! He and I both love them, and they had bought a small basket of them on the way home. Yum! Akane said they were quite expensive but it was worth the price just to see the expression on Riku's face as he pulled out the stem on two of them, washed them, and brought them back so we could eat them together. I hope he always thinks of me when he eats cherries. </p>
<p>It was a rushed evening for sure for Riku, as he had a quick tub, and then his homework to do, although it took only three minutes, if that, as it was very basic adding and subtracting, with pictures to help out. </p>
<p>The Co-op delivered groceries today, and since we weren't home, it was left at the door with dry ice keeping it cold. Riku's treat after homework was done was to observe that dry ice in a bowl Bryn set out for him, and did he love it! It was such fun to watch his face as he watched the "smoke" moving around, covered it with a book, and asked lots of questions. </p>
<p>I wanted to tuck him in tonight, as my nights left here are too few. We looked at a Japanese book of the solar system, and Riku pointed out a green moon, and a blue moon ... not sure what they are(!) ... but loved to hear him say "Aren't they just amazing?" and "Isn't it incredible?" </p>
<p>It was so hot up in his room tonight, and Riku, who usually settles in quickly after his story, was very restless. He lay quietly for a few minutes, and then came out with "Man, I just can't sleep!". I reassured him that sleep will come, that he just needed to lie quietly and perhaps count to himself. I got him into lighter-weight  PJs, and that helped, but Bryn also came in and opened the window a crack and that did the trick. It was 8:30 before he was asleep, though ... too late for this early riser, after such a long busy day! </p>
<p>Akane fell asleep with Mirei, Bryn was upstairs working, and I had a little extra time for some family tree work on Akane's computer. This was just perfect timing, as once again I was so excited because Gail and I have had contact with a distant relative in England on our Mom's father's side, with information we have never had before! I could stay up until the early hours, working on this, but won't. Instead I blogged and went to bed, sleeping in my own tatami room for the first time in many days. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/teachers_principals_and_lots_o.html">A Teacher, a Principal,  Lots of "Hello"s and the Dancing Duo</a></h2>
								<p>Okay, it was bloody hard getting out of bed this morning ... all the way from the floor up seemed an especially long way, after taking no pain meds the night before, but I sure did like waking up in my "own" bed. I had a rough night without that to deal with, as I had trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, and was awake every twenty minutes or so from 4 A.M. </p>
<p>The rest of my day was great! I had a long long hot shower, nice and early before the family awoke. We had a great morning with the children today.They were up early enough that they had lots of free time this morning. </p>
<p>Riku (aka Mr. Dyment)  and Mirei (his student and, strangely enough, his daughter too!) started off by playing school as soon as they were dressed. So while their breakfast was being prepared, Riku was busy asking Mirei math questions (which he answered for her in whispers), and "checking" her homework. They both had backpacks filled with papers and books, and amused themselves very nicely. When it was time to eat, I told the "teacher" that it was his break time and he should come to the teacher's lounge, while Mirei sat two seats away in the "lunch room". They actually had time for two fifteen-minute "breaks" to leave the table and continue with their role-playing. </p>
<p>Riku left the house right at 8 A.M., a minute before me, and was down at the corner of the street when I walked out. I called out to him, and he turned back, grinning at me. Mr. Independent! I imagine he will be walking to school on his own within the next month or so, although I don't know, he sure likes having someone to walk and talk with, and his dad and I like it too. </p>
<p>Since we left in good time, it meant it was a "meandering" walk to school (no rushing at all). Mirei insists on kissing and hugging him before he leaves, and I must try to get a photo of this sweet goodbye at the door. (Her "good night"s to him are equally enthusiastic and loving.)</p>
<p>Lots of children regularly saying "good morning" or "hello!" in English to me now. Other children overhear it, then say it too, and the next day they come right up to greet me. </p>
<p>Today, thinking Riku might like a little more independence, I asked him if he would like me to leave him before entering the courtyard area, and walk to his classroom on his own. He surprised me by saying, "Nana, I never want you to do that. I always want you to come with me." That may have changed when I am back again in November, so I'll continue to enjoy that extra few minutes with him. </p>
<p>Rain was threatening this morning, so we went prepared with brollies and raincoats but, despite the heavy breeze and the slightly threatening darkness, it never happened. It did cool down last night and we were all glad it did. Sleeping is so much easier when it's cool in those upstairs bedrooms! </p>
<p>Mirei was out of school at noon today, so she and Akane had lunch out, as they always do on Wednesdays. Bryn cooked himself a pizza, and shared a tiny piece with me, as it smelled soooo good, but I was having a delicious kabocha squash croquette that Akane had picked up for me, along with a banana and the last of the almonds from SF. </p>
<p>Mirei was in my room with me, lounging about on my bed, at 2:35 when Riku peeked into the open window to say hello to us! I didn't expect him home until 2:45. They must have gotten out at 2:15, but he told me he was ahead of everyone all the way home, except for one boy, and that he (Riku) had run all the way! That would be quite the feat actually, with his heavy backpack.  :)</p>
<p>Riku did his piano practice early today, plus his second lot of easy homework, while Mirei and I went up to her room, with a big stack of books to read. However, she got distracted with bags of toys at her end of the room, so I started sorting through Riku's clothes, once more getting them into piles of short-sleeved shirts, long sleeved, PJs, etc. Bryn came in at one point, and went downstairs with the stack of short-sleeved shirts, and had Riku try them on, and Akane decide what to keep and what could be given away. One pile down, five to go! But just getting them sorted made him happy, as he can now see the top of his dresser. </p>
<p>Mirei has to take two blown eggs to school next Monday for a project, and so Bryn and Riku took care of this. Bryn punched the holes carefully into the shells, and then he had Riku break the yolks, while he blew them out. Riku decided it was too yucky to do himself, but he sure did enjoy watching the whole process, and taking part in the clean part of it too. </p>
<p>Riku and Mirei started to watch a Japanese movie he had wanted to see; however, they sat through about a half hour of it, and started playing "teacher" again, so off went the TV, and not too much later Riku was in the tub for a long play, and then Mirei. </p>
<p>While Mirei tubbed, Riku did his reading, from a great book in which he loves the illustrations by Chris Van Allsburg. No story, but lots of room for imagining what the story might be, with a hint from the one line provided with each picture. Interesting book for sure! It's called "The Mysteries of Harris Burdick".</p>
<p>Bryn helped Akane with some of the dinner prep', and we had a most delicious meal. Mirei spotted mine and wanted it, of course ... brown rice with a perfectly cooked fried egg on top of it, and a wonderful new dish, to me, of a special kind of seaweed, with thin strips of tofu and carrot cooked in with it. Akane told me that a lot of restaurants in SF serve this, as it is a popular macrobiotic dish. Yum! I loved it and ate lots of it. The rest of the family ate two different types of fish, one raw, and a smoked salmon, with an egg foo yung type dish with crab. </p>
<p>There was some time for the children to dance together after dinner, and it was such fun to see that I taped some of it, and took photos too. Riku was twirling Mirei around and they did some improv' too. Adorable! </p>
<p>A much cooler night meant an earlier night for both children. Riku asleep at 7:45 and Mirei not much later. Bryn and Akane went off to the clinic for a follow-up visit for Bryn. They came back bearing 21 tablets the doctor gave Bryn for pain, which he doesn't feel he needs, so gave them to me (I have given up on the notion of doing without pain meds!). Coincidentally, they are the same tablets that I was prescribed ten of, so that will more than cover my next few days' needs. </p>
<p>I went to bed early and read ... the perfect end to my day. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/thursday_akane_in_sakai_slushi.html">Thursday ... "Hello"s,  Some Would-Be Spying, and Slushies</a></h2>
								<p>I felt great this morning! No trouble at all getting up from my bed on the floor, and was in the shower at 6 A.M., with a load of laundry started, and the children's fruit on the table when they came downstairs. Breakfast for the children was relaxed and easy; they ate the fruit right away, Riku polished off his egg and toast, had a fifteen minute break ... drew, and then had porridge, did his morning routine, and we were out the door at 8 A.M. again. Mirei was a little slower today eating her breakfast, and had trouble sitting at the table for some reason. She has an extra fifteen or twenty minutes before she heads out, though, so that helps. </p>
<p>After all the children yesterday stopping to say "hello" and "good morning" to me in English, I decided to take some photos of a few of then today. It was fun, and most of the children are more than happy to pose for me, with big smiles and their peace signs. On the way home I stopped to take some photos of the heron, and hope at least one of them turns out for me. </p>
<p>Akane went off to Sakai to meet with her mom and run some errands, so Bryn and I were on our own with the children after school. After breakfast, I hung up the laundry — lovely breezes all day today, and then I caught up on some emails and did some blogging. </p>
<p>Riku has been coming home on his own for quite a few days now, and I thought it would be fun to "spy" on him, and get some photos when he was unaware of my presence. So, I headed out the door at 2:30 today, kept out of sight once I spotted the children walking toward the bridge, and hid behind a drink machine. And along came one older group of children, then a group of younger children with a few older students, but no Riku! An older fellow spotted me hiding, and by way of gestures, I was able to let him know what I was doing hiding away with a camera at the ready! He has seen Riku and me walking home before. Nice to know that someone is paying attention to slightly irregular behaviour!</p>
<p>By then I had decided that Riku must have gone a different way, and so I started walking up toward the house. I got all the way home (by this time it was 2:55 and they he is always home before this)  but he wasn't here. I was a little concerned, of course, and called up to Bryn, who headed immediately out on his bike. </p>
<p>I thought perhaps he had gone to one of the two boys' homes he knows of in the neighbourhood, without asking permission, but was still worried. I headed right back out too, and about three blocks away, around the corner he came, with Bryn right there with him, and about six older boys! </p>
<p>It turned out they had a late dismissal today, as some of the older children in the school were in the classrooms with the younger ones, while the teacher and the students explained some of the dangers of walking home and how to avoid them. Apparently there is an effort made in some of the schools to involve the older students in the care of the younger ones. They were being very friendly with Riku, and all of them called out goodbye to him as we walked along with him home. What a great idea! Now he knows he can call on them if he needs some help along the way. </p>
<p>Yesterday I had Riku freeze apple juice in a cup in the freezer and he liked it so much that I did one for him again today. He was just delighted with it; such an easy way to make him smile. Riku played with Lego in his room for the longest time, so I got the laundry in, folded, and put away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Riku started a letter to Skylar, "the" girl in his classroom in SF, who sent him a framed photo of herself. Riku has a photo of the two of them to send off to her, as well as a picture he drew for her of his house. He did a great job on the accompanying letter, composing it himself, while I spelled out any words he was unsure of. His letter started off on a very positive note "Dear Skylar, Japan is beautiful."</p>
<p>While he did this, I was in the kitchen preparing a Spanish potato omelet for our dinner. It was a staple in our house from the time Kelly and Bryn were children, and Riku and Mirei have had it a few times as well. It is fairly fast, easy, and nutritious, and can vary each time too. Tonight's version had spinach and grated carrot in it, as well as the usual garlic, onions, potatoes, eggs, and cheese ... this time mozzarella, and not the traditional cheddar. Riku just wolfed it down, eating twice as much as I thought he would! Dinner was on the table at 5:30, and by 6 o'clock the dishes were done, and Riku did his spelling with Bryn, before Bryn tubbed both children. The children had lots of free time after this, and played their favourite "cat" game.</p>
<p>Mirei had done her "homework" too, printing both "Mirei" and "Nana" so well; I love how she just loves to do this, and does it already without asking what letter is next.  </p>
<p>Akane arrived home at 6:30, Riku did his two minutes worth of homework, and then his piano practice; he was playing beautifully and I did some taping. While he played, Mirei and I sat on the sofa while she combed my hair, and I combed hers. We read a story too, and so the evening ended. </p>
<p>My hips and back were very sore from the too-long standing in the kitchen. This meant it was particularly hard to settle in with Riku, who also seemed to have trouble falling asleep tonight. Getting up from his low bed was not fun tonight either! I spent most of the evening going through magazines, with a nice hot pack on my back, and making some blog notes. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/a_friendly_neighbour_friendly.html">A Friendly Neighbour,  More Friendly Faces, and a Lovely Walk to Riku's Piano Lesson</a></h2>
								<p>Oh, I was one sore woman today! Standing in one spot is what I find the hardest thing to do, so the little bit of it I did last night did me in. I felt fine while I was doing it, but getting up in the night was almost as bad as it was the second or third night. Even after my usual long hot shower, I just hurt everywhere. Arggh! I will be happy when I can just bounce out of bed again, and not have to rely on the children helping me put my socks on. It is sweet, though, that they are both happy to put on one sock each to help me out! </p>
<p>Riku and I left at 8 for school today, and once he was in his classroom, I spotted a young boy with a marvelous bright green bug on his hand. I admired it, went back in to get Riku, and soon we had a big group of children gathered 'round to see it as well. I let it crawl on me, as Riku was afraid it was poisonous. Someone at school has been telling him that most of the bugs they see are poisonous and he believes them! I am determined to prove them wrong.I think the children were very impressed with my bravery! </p>
<p>On my way home, I took a route that had me pass by a man whom I see each day,tending to his flowers in front of his house. I have never spoken to him, as he is almost always crouching, but I did sneak a photo of him from the back one day. Today his neighbour, a man, was coming out of his door, but I was on the street, and moving fast enough that I didn't have to try to decide whether to speak to him or not. I rarely do to men, especially ones over fifty or so, as they rarely seem approachable, though of course there are exceptions. But making that decision wasn't necessary today. </p>
<p>Much to my surprise, when I was a few yards ahead of this fellow, I heard him call out "good morning" to me in Japanese. I turned and returned his greeting, and he went on to speak to me, in pretty good English, asking many questions: where was I staying, where did I live (I always volunteer that I am "Canada-jin" — "from Canada" — but live in SF), and then how long was my visit. I used fingers to tell him, and he understood, and then told him I was flying back in three days. He bowed and said goodbye and smiled when I said goodbye to him in Japanese. Encounters like this make me happy! </p>
<p>Last weekend I was out walking with the children, and a man passed by us, greeting the children by name! I had no idea who he was, and neither did the children, but later in the week, the same fellow passed by again, greeting me warmly. He lives just two doors down the street from us, but I had never met him before. Some of the locals are certainly curious about this new family in the neighbourhood, and have gone out of their way to meet and greet Akane, Bryn, and the children ... and me too! </p>
<p>I really did take it easy, as Bryn strongly suggested for the rest of the morning and the early afternoon, spending lots of time on the computer, while Akane was out of the house, and then sitting on the sofa with a hot pack for the rest of the time. Akane went out and bought eggs, some "instant" hot packs for me for the plane trip, and a Tylenol equivalent too, as the pills that the doctor prescribed for both me and Bryn don't always seem to work for me. </p>
<p>However, Riku's piano lesson is today, and Bryn had suggested earlier in my visit that I go along and see him not only playing (we get to sit in the same room with him), but to see the lovely little park/shrine area where he has his snack beforehand. Bryn didn't think it a good idea for me to do that walk today, though, and actively discouraged me, as it is half again as long as the walk to school. But I don't want to wait until November to meet his teacher and envision his walk there. So, we walked slowly to school, and met Riku, along with lots of children who surrounded us on our way out of the grounds. </p>
<p>It is just a lovely walk to where Riku's piano teacher lives, in amongst the hills behind the school. The road is winding, and the views are just lovely all the way along up to the forested part of the area. When there is time, Akane and Riku usually stop to have his snack on the grounds of a small shrine, but today, since he is now in school longer, we had time for just a quick look, and a few photos too, of course. He snacked on apple slices on the way.</p>
<p>His teacher, Sensei Abe (Ab-eh) is just lovely: soft spoken, gentle, and ever so patient. Bryn and I sat in the small room behind Riku and the teacher at the piano, and of course I took lots of video and a few photos during practice. At the end, she played a "game" with Riku where she played a few notes on a small keyboard, and Riku replicated them on the piano. We were amazed at how well he did! He obviously has a good ear, and he got several thumbs up from her. At the end of the lesson, I asked if I could take a photo of them, then Bryn took one of me with them, and then she got her camera and took a few photos as well! Just a few hours later she had sent them through to us. I liked her very much, and she told Bryn to bring me back another time, but that won't be until late fall. </p>
<p>We stopped to smell some gorgeous yellow roses on the way home, and I took a few photos of the surrounding hills. Much to my surprise, Bryn hailed a cab and I was very happy to not face the half-hour walk home. I was knackered, and happy to be home with my feet up and a hot pack behind my back. I pretty much stayed there the entire evening, and felt much better for it too. </p>
<p>Bryn bathed with the children again tonight, with lots of happy laughter coming from the bath area (music to my soul), and Mirei blew some bubbles at the end of her bath. </p>
<p>I was feeling better enough at the end of the day that I asked if Riku could sleep in with me for my final three nights there. Bryn agreed, and Riku and I were both very happy. After the children were tucked into bed , Akane and Bryn left for dinner out, and I had some computer time. Not much, though, as I was sore, and tired, and headed off to bed before 10 P.M.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/a_first_all_day_at_home.html">A First ... All Day at Home</a></h2>
								<p>This morning felt like a school day, as Riku has a field trip today, and he and Akane had to leave the house at 8:40 A.M. Riku and I enjoyed our slow waking up together time first, though, and then Mirei quietly slid open the door to see if we were awake. Seeing that we were (we had been very quiet), she said "Oh, you're already awake!" and joined us in bed for a little bit. But soon they were both up and on the move. I sat with them while they had their fruit and breakfast, and left showering until after Riku and Akane departed. </p>
<p>It's dreary again today, with no sun in sight. Mirei went up to her dad's office and played on the floor while he worked and I showered, and then we played in her room, did some reading on the sofa together, and I laughed at all her funny faces. What an entertainer she is! I just cannot wait to see what this little girl chooses to do with her life. I hope she never loses her zany and uninhibited sense of silliness. </p>
<p>I was just plain sore today. No idea why, but I was very comfy sitting on the sofa while Mirei played with and around me. Akane and Riku had lunch out together, and enjoyed the Botanical Garden trip, especially since the rain held off for them. </p>
<p>Riku did his piano practice, his spelling, and his reading, having that all out of the way early in the day. Akane made my favourite noodle dish for dinner, along with lots of edamame and steamed carrots. Mirei will eat an entire bowl of the edamame on her own, before Riku or anyone else even notices. She is expert at getting them out of the pods in the most efficient way, and now I know enough to put some on Riku's plate, and to take some for myself, before Mirei gets to them. Both children eat such a wonderful variety of foods, but whereas Mirei loves to eat, Riku mostly just eats what he has to. Once in a while he will polish off his plate quickly, but he would rather do almost anything else other than sit at the table and just eat. </p>
<p>Bryn bathed the children again tonight; it has become his "job" since I fell, and Akane and I cleaned up the kitchen together. I read a nice long story to Riku, and he was asleep quickly. He was tired after his three hours of tromping about the garden, with all that fresh air. </p>
<p>Akane fell asleep with Mirei tonight, and I sat at her computer catching up on my blog and emails, and later, when Bryn went out for a drink, I went through dozens and dozens of photos on his computer, searching out the perfect blog pics for the last few days. He has not had time to add them to my blogs, so Doug will be doing these when I get back home. I am thankful for this team that keeps my blogs going! </p>
<p>Bedtime at 11 P.M. for me tonight ... feeling sad as the time to leave comes ever closer. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/a_dreary_grey_day_for_my_last.html">A Drizzly, Grey Day, and My Last in Kyoto for Many Moons</a></h2>
								<p>Riku slept in until 6:45 A.M. today, waking when he heard Mirei running about upstairs. It was drizzly and grey when we opened our eyes, and it would have been very easy to roll over and go back to sleep ... if rolling over were easy right now, and if there weren't two happy sunny children eager to get on with the day. </p>
<p>They rediscovered a "camping" kit and had such fun playing up in their room together after breakfast. Mirei was very fond of the lantern that really lights up, and was delighted that my room was so dark with the metal shades still pulled across. Riku liked the (plastic) "Swiss Army" knife, and Mirei used it to "clean" my fingernails! </p>
<p>I had hoped to make oatmeal cookies with the children today, something we had planned to do just before my fall, but knew I wouldn't be up for the normally fun activity.They weren't aware that I had been hoping to do this, so I sat on the sofa while they played happily around me. </p>
<p>Mirei and I went for a forty-minute walk in the late morning, while Riku did his piano practice. Mirei insisted on taking her umbrella, even though it was barely misting at that stage, but I was without a hood on my jacket and was very happy to carry it for her when the rain came down more seriously! She had on one of her favourite raincoats, with flowers on it, so we both stayed dry. Mirei wanted to walk to the "new" playground to see if Yui-kun, the little boy she played with the first time we went, was there, but of course no one was on this rainy day. We were happy to wander, though, and did so, slowly up and down the blocks, checking to see if her "snowman" lady was in her window. No such luck, and Mirei decided she was "probably having a nap." </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn were having a new Internet connection installed this morning, so Bryn was without his computer for a few hours, with some problem that eventually got fixed up. However, that put him behind in some work he needed to do, and it meant that none of us had computer access for a few hours today.</p>
<p>I put the time to good use, and packed up all my belongings from the one shelf in "my" room. I was sure I was going to need to pack up a big box, as I am taking things back to SF with me that Akane and Bryn don't want any longer, but luckily it all fit into the two bags I have with me. I want to carry only one small bag onto the plane, with my book, ticket, and a bit of food.  </p>
<p>Later in the day, Riku drew a second picture for Skylar, as the first one he drew for her — of his house — somehow disappeared. And, when he had that all set to go, the photo of him with Skylar had disappeared as well! Mirei was beside him drawing too, while I sat on the sofa watching and listening to all the exchanges going on. </p>
<p>Later, the photo fell out of one of Mirei's many many bags that she likes to carry all over the house, stuffed with the things she considers essential to her happiness. She looks like an overloaded workhorse, albeit a very cute one! She reminds me so much of Caillie when she does this: Caillie still has bags and bags of things she needs going from her mom's to her dad's, driving both of them wild. Ah well, this too shall pass. </p>
<p>The children started watching an Ultraman show, but Mirei loses interest in TV very quickly, as did her daddy at the same age, so went back to her bags, hauling them here and there, as she came upon anything newish. She and Akane went off together to the grocery store as well, so she had two walks in the rain today. </p>
<p>I snuggled up beside Riku on the sofa to keep him company, as he loves someone to watch anything at all with him, but I kept dozing off and snoring! I would tell him I was watching every minute of it, and that my body was just making weird noises, but he didn't buy that for a minute! We all had a nice fruit snack on the sofa too, something not usually allowed. Shhhhh. "Mum's the word," as Mirei would say. </p>
<p>Akane ordered two plain pizzas in for dinner, a first this trip, and had bought tomatoes and fresh basil to add to them if we chose. It was good, but not Amici's. Bryn showered both the children together tonight, for a treat, and by 6:45 they were both flossed, brushed, and ready for story times. Riku and I read a few pages of "I Found a Dead Bird", which always leads to lots of interesting discussions once the light is out. </p>
<p>I had some time on the computer once Riku was asleep, but was too sore and tired to concentrate on emails or blogging, so did a few family tree hits instead. Bed at 11 P.M., my last night here for too long a time. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/kyoto_to_san_francisco.html">Kyoto to San Francisco</a></h2>
								<p>I had a very restless last night, awake every hour or two, off and on throughout the entire night. Each time I felt as though three or four hours had passed, only to find a mere hour had. I had a lot on my mind ... leaving the children for so long, how the flight would go when I wouldn't be able to move much to get comfortable, how many pain tablets I had left, whether I should get up and take two right away, but most of it was upset, hating the thought of not seeing these children for six months. They will have changed so much by then, and I know how much I will be missing. I'm hoping I sleep on this flight, not something I usually do, but today it would be bliss. </p>
<p>Riku woke at 6:15, after hearing Mirei upstairs. He just bounces out of bed, but there is always a ten-minute coming 'round period too, when he is still slumbering, and wraps his arm around the back of my neck. Tonight he will be back upstairs, sleeping in his own bed, and being a big boy again. </p>
<p>I put the kettle on for Akane's and Bryn's tea, made the fruit plates for the children, one for myself today too, and showered, letting the hot water relax those tight muscles in my back. Then I sat with the children as they ate their breakfast; Mirei had <strong>two</strong> fried eggs this morning with her toast and ate every bite of it. Riku had his usual one, plus cereal with blueberries, and got to play with a funny little recording device. He and I both spoke sentences one at a time, and then he howled with laughter each time we heard them played back, as our voices were somewhat distorted and often interrupted the previous sentence. </p>
<p>Mirei helped me with my socks for the very last time today, even though I was attempting to put them on myself. She insisted, and told me that Grandpa could help me when I go home. "Soon you will be all better, Nana!" and yes, I shall. Can't wait! </p>
<p>It's a gorgeous day here today; I'm so glad I didn't leave yesterday when it was grey and drizzly all day long. Doug emailed to say there had been a hot spell, which has broken, and so it's going to be lovely on both ends of my (long) day. </p>
<p>I said goodbye to Mirei at the door, and made it quick, as she really has no idea how long it will be before we see each other again. I was feeling pretty teary, and I didn't want her to be sad. I got a nice kiss and a gentle hug earlier too, and a wave goodbye as Riku and I left for school at 8:05. Bryn will be walking Riku to school from now on; I'm going to miss our walks each day, as I did when he left San Francisco. It's always a lovely way to start off a weekday. </p>
<p>Riku spotted a long thin worm today as we walked along, and there was time for him to stop for a good look at it. It was moving fast, which really surprised Riku, and he asked me to tell his parents that he had seen his first live worm! Apparently he has seen only dead ones, which is hard to imagine, and even though I looked for it on the way home as promised, he/she had disappeared. We talked about buying a box of worms, maybe a hundred or more, and letting them loose in his back yard to make it healthier, and he thought it would be fun to dig them up too, and see how they were doing. We always check for the heron near the river, and we saw just his head and neck today; he was very still and must have been looking for breakfast. </p>
<p>And of course today I got to say "goodbye" to everyone, and not just "good morning". First was our friendly neighbour around the corner, then the principal who took my photo with Riku for me, a couple of the moms we always pass, and finally a group of boys who often greet us in the morning. I took two photos of them, so it will be fun to see all those familiar faces once I get home. Riku and I had a private kiss and hug before we got to his classroom, and then a long hug on his way back from getting a drink at the fountain down the hall. I had a hard time with that final goodbye and delayed it as long as possible. We waved to each other all the way down to the end of the corridor, before he went into this classroom. </p>
<p>I had a letter to mail to Skylar, Riku's "friend" from Starr King in San Francisco, so I walked the long way home leaving me to come up to the mailbox from the streets below us. It paid off, as I hoped it would, as I got to say goodbye to Mirei's "snowman" lady who was sitting outside her door in a chair, watching the gardening going on in the plot next to her home. That made my day, and I was so pleased to wave goodbye to her, and to take her photo too! </p>
<p>I put my bedding in the washer, got Bryn to hang up the two duvets we used, and then had breakfast and finished up my packing. My pick-up is at 12:50, for my 5:30 P.M. flight. I dashed off an email to my sisters, letting them know what time I would be in. Strange, as I leave at 5:30 tonight, Monday, and will be arriving in San Francisco at 11 A.M. today!</p>
<p>I had a big fruit plate for my breakfast with a few nuts; Akane came right back from dropping Mirei off at school and made me a wonderful packed lunch for my trip ... those yummy noodles with veggies and tofu that we had on Saturday, five inari (I like Akane's more than any I have tasted) and (I was delighted to find) a bag with lots of fresh carrot sticks too. It was all packed carefully with napkins and wooden chopsticks as well! Lucky me! </p>
<p>I had so much I wanted to take, and got right at it ... some photos of the upstairs, pics of the hole I had dropped into, a frozen juice slushie for each of the children, and a note to them each. I was just finishing off Riku's when the shuttle arrived, ten minutes early, but of course by the time the suitcases were packed, and I was in and settled, with the bill paid, it was exactly 12:50. Gail and Tom had thoughtfully dashed off some mega painkillers for me in the mail, and it turned out that after I had said goodbye to Akane and Bryn, and just pulled away from the house, Bryn checked the mail box and found they were there! They hadn't been fifteen minutes earlier, as I had checked. Too bad, as this might have made the trip a little more comfortable for me. </p>
<p>We drove into Kyoto to pick up an American couple from NYC, very friendly people, who had just finished up their three-month world tour in Kyoto. We chatted on the way to the airport, and it was lovely having company. We arrived at the airport at exactly 3 P.M., a half hour earlier than Akane had requested the porter, to help with my bags. However, the fellow at the curbside, along with my very nice driver, managed to get him there earlier for me. He was an enthusiastic, friendly young man, and took care of all of my bags, staying with me until they were loaded on the weigh scale. We waited less than five minutes to get to the check-in counter. </p>
<p>By this time I was ready for my first cup of tea of the day, so stopped at a Starbuck's cafe before going to my gate. Once I had that in hand, I realized I was hungry and so ate half of my noodle dish and an inari too, both so tasty! Then I was off to the gate area to read until my flight was called. The woman from the shuttle bus tracked me down to ask how I was doing, and, when it was time to board, an American fellow, who was passing by as I struggled to get out of my seat, offered to carry my bag on board for me. </p>
<p>I had changed my seat at the check-in counter, hoping that I might end up with two seats at the back of the plane to myself, and I lucked out! It was just perfect, as I could still sit by the window for the view and the extra leaning space, but not have to struggle past anyone when I wanted to get up to move a bit. I put my four hot packs on my back, and settled in for the long flight home. </p>
<p>It all went very well, much better than I hoped, as there was enough room that I could fidget at will. I watched a movie, did lots of reading, slept for perhaps an hour, enjoyed the rest of my meal from Akane, except for the inari, which I plan to enjoy here at home, and enjoyed the little meals that were part of the trip ... dinner, and a snack shortly before landing. I always get hungry on planes, so having the extra meal was a plus for me. </p>
<p>We landed a little bit early, and it was such a treat to walk out and find Doug waiting for me. It is good to be home, and I know I will be taking it much easier here, not having the temptation of walking with the children. </p>
<p>I had zero energy for the rest of the day, happy to lie about reading magazines, checking email once in a while, and napped about 1 P.M. for just an hour while lying on the sofa. It was wonderful to have Doug taking care of me, making me tea, and heating up some dinner for us. I was awake enough to watch a movie with him too, which ended at 11, and then turned in for the night, with two pillows tucked around me. Home.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/one_of_the_things_i_did_on_my.html">One of the Things I Did on Spring Vacation — aka "Stepping Into The Hole"</a></h2>
								<p>OK, I have written plenty about having stepped into "the hole", and its aftermaths, so here are a few pics' of that experience.</p>
<p>Mirei near the offending hole. It looks so innocent when covered, doesn't it?</p>
<p>Me crashed out on the sofa the next day, where I stayed put for many many hours over the next eleven days. </p>
<p>Mirei at the playground tending to the scratch on my hand, the injury that worried her the most.</p>
<p>I didn't realize for many days that I had scraped/bruised my entire left leg, from hip to ankle, while sliding into that hole. I had Bryn take a photo of it.</p>
<p>Next is a photo of me on the sofa wearing the wonderful pressure belt/bandage that I was still wearing a month later. I could sit there comfortably for a couple of hours, reading to the children, watching them play, and working on Akane's laptop. </p>
<p>On the day I left Japan, I talked Bryn into stepping into the hole (having refused his offer to lower me in!) to show the depth of it, and then I was off to California, after a final goodbye to my nemesis. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/my_first_letter_from_riku.html">West Coast Live, and My First Letter from Riku!</a></h2>
								<p>Doug had booked us into today's airing for the local "West Coast Live" program this morning, one of our favourite public radio programs. We left in lots of time, as parking is impossible near the Ferry Building on Saturdays, so Doug dropped me off and he went off on his search. I stopped by the Acme bread booth and picked us up a small batch of sticky cinnamon rolls to eat while we waited in our second row seats. Yum! </p>
<p>The program starts at 10 A.M. and ends at the noon hour. Sedge Thomson, the host, is always friendly, welcoming, and open to all of his guests, knowledgeable about their various topics and fields of interest. We have been to several of these programs over the years and they are always entertaining.</p>
<p>Today's guests included Slaid Cleaves, a singer/songwriter we have seen here locally several times, and at the Cambridge folk festival in England in 2001. An author, Lisa Hamilton, gave a very interesting talk/interview on "unconventional farmers in the age of agribusiness", about the organic farmers she has talked with over the past two years. We very much enjoyed a food author/critic who wrote a book called "Hungry Monkey", a quest to introduce to his young daughter to good food. And to end the show, Mariel Hemingway promoted her new book about eating as well: "Mariel's Kitchen: Simple Ingredients for a Delicious and Satisfying Life". She is lovely and engaging and I am looking forward to trying the cookies she is bringing to market, using coconut flour. It was a relaxing and fun two hours and good to get out and do something local and entertaining. </p>
<p><a href="/i/2009-15-30%20WCL-1.jpg"><img height="200" src="/i/2009-15-30%20WCL-1-thumb.jpg" width="133"></a> <a href="/i/2009-15-30%20WCL-2.jpg"><img height="200" src="/i/2009-15-30%20WCL-2-thumb.jpg" width="133"></a></p>
<p>The Saturday market was on, of course, and so we wandered slowly about (it is so crowded that the pace is slow anyway, suiting me just fine), doing some sampling, and buying some lovely fresh-picked tomatoes, snap peas, and new tiny Yukon Gold potatoes. It was a lovely outing, but it did tucker me out and I was happy to be home with a hot cup of tea on the sofa. </p>
<p>Lucky me! Today's mail brought an extra-special treat, my very first letter from Riku. When I was in Japan, Bryn had been encouraging Riku to write letters to friends. Kai, a pal from his "Little Angel's" program had written and sent along a couple of photos, plus a drawing. Riku answered that, then wrote to Skylar, a special girl from his grade one class here in San Francisco. She got a drawing as well, and I was very happy to find that I was on the list too! I hope this is the beginning of a long correspondence with my youngest grandson. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/05/post_3.html">A Surprise Invitation</a></h2>
								<p>Doug had picked Susan, Kevin, and the children up at the airport at 11:20 this morning, back from their ten-day visit to Toronto and further afield, and into Quebec too. I was home taking it very easy, spending some time on the computer, and reading during my frequent breaks from sitting here. </p>
<p>Much to our delight, we had a phone call from Susan about 1:30, wondering if we would like to join them for a very early supper ... sort of "dunch", I guess. I was ready to get out of the house for a break, and ready to hear about their trip and see the children, so the answer of course was a resounding "We'd love to!" </p>
<p>I got a little burst of energy and made a pan of brownies (with some chopped dried cranberries), to take with us. We were at the door at 3 P.M. on the nose, and heard Amelia calling out "Hi Nana! Hi Grandpa" from the living room, and Finn was leaning over the gate at the top of the stairs calling to us exuberantly as well. He was all smiles, and followed Doug into the kitchen, while I headed for the living room to see Amelia. I got a nice gentle hug, and she asked how I was feeling now. I snuggled next to her and watched a bit of her movie with her, and then left to say hello to Susan and Finn. </p>
<p>We visited and caught up on our news, while Finn and Doug sat together in the bean bag chair in the living room, "reading" aka "looking to see if there are any photos in the adult books from the bookcase in that room." Not many, as it turned out, but the hunt was fun, I gather, as they were in there and quiet for the longest time! </p>
<p>Dunch time! We sat at their lovely new big table to a choice of three Amici's pizzas, freshly delivered. Yum! Amelia urged me to try the pesto, her new favourite, and Finn was helping himself to one of each, after taste-testing them first. We had salad, I ate lots of pizza(!), chatted away, and then finished up with cheesecake and/or the brownies, and tea. Yummy, every bite of it. </p>
<p>Amelia had catch-up homework to do, finishing up the daily journal she was to keep while on holiday. She had done a creative job on many of the pages with dried leaves, admission passes to various museums in Toronto, details of her day at Opa's 80th birthday party, visiting with relatives, swimming at Uncle Peter's pool and four days at his cottage near Tremblant, Quebec. Amelia was tired though, and had been sick at the hotel this morning and again on the plane, so I felt sorry for her as she dragged on, trying to finish up, when all she wanted to do was relax and talk with us. </p>
<p>Kevin bathed Finn; I cleared the table, and then sat down with another cup of tea, while Amelia got those last two sentences done up. We left as she was about to pop in the tub, and I heard later that both children were asleep at 7 P.M. </p>
<p>It's lovely to have them home, and so good to have little ones in my life again. </p>
