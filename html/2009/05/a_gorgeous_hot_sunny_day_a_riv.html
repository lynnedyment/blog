								<h2>A Gorgeous Hot Sunny Day, a River, and Two Princesses</h2>
								<p>Riku woke this morning telling me he dreamed about Skylar, a classmate in his grade one class in San Francisco (and a girl he admits to "liking"). He always gets a little grin on his face when he, or anyone else, mentions her name. He drew a picture for her this morning after breakfast, and sometime soon will write her a letter too. Her mom emailed Bryn yesterday to say that Skylar had been talking about Riku too, and she hoped they would become pen pals. </p>
<p>Riku had a follow-up visit with an allergist before noon today, and he had shown some interest in going "to the steps by Mirei's school" as well.  I bought a day pass for ¥500 (approximately $5.00), as we had a fair number of bus trips to do today. We ran quite a few errands before lunch at the Chinese restaurant where we ate two weeks ago ... picking up some meds for Riku's ongoing sinus infection/allergy problem, and walking to his skin specialist for an ongoing problem as well. There was lots of walking between all these places, and both children were such troopers about it. </p>
<p>Finally we were on the number 9 bus that we take to Mirei's school, and got off at the same stop. The "steps" Riku was talking about are a city renewal project of a once pristine river that flows through the city, and that had fallen into disrepair over the years. I'm not sure when it was finished, but what a lovely spot it is! Halfway there, Riku, tired from walking, sitting at the restaurant, and then sitting on a crowded bus, had decided he wanted to go home and not to the steps. But he was one happy camper, as was Mirei, once we got there. </p>
<p>The river at this spot is very very shallow, not even knee deep for children, and it's a long straight passageway with a bridge further along, and perfectly spaced concrete blocks, set in the water, for children and adults to walk along. Riku chose to walk in the water, playing with a boat he had with him, and even though Mirei and I took off our shoes to walk there too, the rocks were just a little too pebbly for our tender feet! </p>
<p>We walked back out, and were sitting on a bench, when Mirei noticed two older children from her French school. They spotted her too, and came running over to speak to her. They speak Japanese as well, which was the language they used with Mirei, and soon the three of them, plus Riku, were chasing each other around and around the area. </p>
<p>Akane had gone off to pick up the new sign for their mailbox, so it now reads Goda/Dyment in something more substantial than the paper Bryn had taped to it when they moved in. Along with some bread and cold cereal (Riku is getting tired of porridge) she came back with small cans of apple juice for the children. After chatting with the girls for a bit, we said goodbye and waited at the bus stop for the number 9 back to our neighbourhood. We lucked out again and all ended up with seats at the back of the bus after just two stops. I was glad I had some snacks with me, as did Akane, to keep Mirei from falling asleep. She was such a tired girl! </p>
<p>Riku did his spelling session with Bryn tonight, which beat last night's record of 25 words in less than four minutes! Riku enjoys doing this, as he's good at it, and can obviously print very quickly too. He read three chapters of a story book to Mirei and me, a treat for sure, as Mirei was very interested in the story, and he reads with lots of expression in his voice, when he's not tired. </p>
<p>After her tub, Mirei sat to do some printing with her dad, and came running into my room, so very excited, because she had printed both her name and mine without being told which letters to use!  I am so amazed at how quickly this little girl learns things! </p>
<p>Mirei has been dressing up in her princess dresses a lot over the past couple of days, and this morning Riku decided to join her. It is the funniest thing, as he makes quite a cute girl, and it's just hilarious to see him wearing a skirt, or lovely dress, and tiara, plus whatever bracelets, rings, and necklaces Mirei decides to share with him. I missed the evening photo but Riku promised he would get dressed up again for me soon. Mirei liked her plastic dangling earrings — and some of those necklaces — so much that she decided to wear them in the tub tonight too. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep at 7:40, Mirei not too much later, and Akane and Bryn went out for a late dinner at a Korean barbecue place, followed by an hour in a very smoky karaoke bar, with really bad videos of the songs being sung. </p>
