								<h2>Monday ... Hot!, First Homework, Bugs, and Mirei Hurting ...</h2>
								<p>And the saga continues; all was well until that dreaded "getting up to the bathroom in the night" routine. Foolishly, wanting to "save" the pain meds I have left, I decided to sleep without them. I didn't realize how much I needed them for just getting up once, but boy, my body let me know it. Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! I did get back to sleep, though, after taking them, and Riku opened my door at 6:30, happy to see me awake. </p>
<p>He was a proud boy today, as he didn't call out once. Bryn heard him make a noise at one point, and went into the room to find Riku sitting up in bed. However, he lay right down again and slept through on his own. Big transition for someone who has had someone in his bed at some point for every night of his life. He told me he woke up at 6 o'clock, made his bed, and tidied up his room until it was time to come down. What a guy! </p>
<p>Sunshine Mirei made her entrance not too much later, in her bright yellow PJs and a big sunny smile. Sometimes she is grumpy when she first awakens, but it doesn't take much to get her on her way to her usual self. Immediate protein helps immensely on those days. "Get some food into that girl!" says her dad. </p>
<p>Riku helped himself to a banana first thing today, so he must have been hungry, and I made up their fruit bowls, sitting with them at the table while they ate. They like to have company, of course, and I was happy to sit and let the parents do the rest of the breakfast routine. </p>
<p>Mirei was in bright pink today, looking as summery as the day feels. She had a few minutes to admire herself in the mirror, looking this way and that way, and making different expressions at herself too, not all of them attractive! She likes to make not only others laugh, but herself too, and I guess practicing this helps in both cases. Akane and Bryn went off to Osaka, by bus and train, to look at storage units and bookcases. They dropped Mirei at school at 9, and continued on their way. </p>
<p>Riku and I left for school at our usual time, didn't see our regular smiling neighbour today, which disappointed both of us, but saw lots of friendly faces on our way.I snapped a photo of the unicycles on the way out, and wonder if the school perhaps owns them. </p>
<p>I walked home more slowly than usual, and saw the kind man in his garden who had given me the cabbage last week. He bowed, and I bowed, and we both exchanged morning greetings. </p>
<p>I sat with heat on my back, emailing, and then had a long phone call from Gail, after eating an egg and toast, the first morning breakfast I have felt like eating in a few days. I caught up on all the news from home ... Paul is coughing horribly and waiting to see his doctor about the two or three growths they have found in his left lung, Beth is understandably stressed out, and Uncle Frank, after six weeks in the hospital, sat up today, and is on a soft food diet. Candy and Rick are in Niagara Falls for Lisa's 70th birthday party, and for some support for all those needing it there. Busy days in Ontario, and worrisome too. If I hadn't hurt my back, I would be planning a trip there a few days after going home.</p>
<p>I got some blogging done, and then did some housework before Riku arrived home at 1:45: dishes, sweeping, and thoroughly cleaning the kitchen counters. At one point I could hear the sound of children outdoors, unusual at this time of day, and got out there in time to see a big group out for a walk with their nursery school teachers. </p>
<p>Just as I was about to slip on my sandals to peek out for Riku, he came bursting through the door, announcing that he walked all the way from the lights on his own. Was he hot! Sweat was dripping from his scalp and face; that haircut came just in the nick of time. </p>
<p>He plunked himself down on the floor in the hallway, took off his socks, and dumped out his school bag, anxious to show me the school photo taken the day before school officially started. He is front and centre in the photo, and his mom, dad, and grandmother are in the photo too. I'm hoping for a copy ... </p>
<p>I have been asking for a few days if he had any homework and the answer has always been "no". Today I didn't ask, and so Riku of course got to tell me he did. </p>
<p>He sat at the table for ten minutes, drinking cold juice, after I had wiped him down with a cool cloth ... on his face, neck, arms, hands, and even his armpits, which made him laugh but that he obviously enjoyed. The house stays cool, though, and so he went up to his room to putter about on his own as usual. He had a cool bowl of mixed fruit, sitting on the edge of the patio door, with the white curtains blowing out behind him. He looked so relaxed and I took a few photos while he was sitting there thinking. </p>
<p>Eventually he made his way outdoors to hunt for and inspect bugs, one of his favourite things to do anywhere at all. He sat eating the rest of his cold fruit salad on the doorstep, with a lovely breeze blowing the curtains around him. I took lots of photos as he was quite the picture sitting there, contemplating his next bug move. </p>
<p>I loved having this quiet time alone with him, as I know only too well how long it will be before I have it again ... and then he'll be a seven-year-old and changed in ways I haven't witnessed. It makes me sad. </p>
<p>I knew he would be a busy boy with all his normal activities, once his parents came home, so I coaxed him into reading with me on the sofa, with bottles of cold water on hand for us, and in exchange I would listen as he walked me through his borrowed book from school, based on the movie they watched on the weekend: "Cats Return". He did a super job explaining in great detail what was going on, who the bad cats were, and who the friends — aka "good guys" — were. The drawings are wonderfully done, and it was fun sitting next to Riku while he translated from the Japanese to me. </p>
<p>At 4:45 we decided to walk to the bus stop to meet Mirei and her parents. There is a point at which Bryn likes to walk one way, and Akane another, so we found a spot where we would see them no matter which way they came. Along the way we stopped to say "hello" to Mirei's "snowman" lady. It was the very first time Riku has met her, so that was fun. Riku decided we should hide, and just peek at the buses as they went by, to see if we could spot them first, but we waited and waited and waited, in a shady spot though, to no avail, and gave up at 5:15. </p>
<p>I did take a couple of photos on that hot walk, though: one of a very tiny fresh produce shop with bamboo poles leaning against the store front to keep it cool, and another of the main business street, where Riku and I were waiting to spot the #19 bus. </p>
<p>We were happy to be back in the cool house. Akane, Bryn, and Mirei arrived home at 5:40, having run some errands after picking up Mirei, so the evening was a little more rushed than would have been ideal. Bryn prepared a pizza for the children with lots of veggies, a standard fast meal, and one that both children enjoy,</p>
<p>Bryn showered with Riku making it extra fast, but Mirei had hurt her forearm somehow during dinner, and was whimpering in pain. Poor wee girl; it isn't often she hurts, and I had her sit with her hand on a pillow, moving it gently to see how much and where it hurt. It was so tender and she flinched with any movement at all. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn discussed taking her to the doctor, but she was so tired and would have had to walk many blocks, and likely wait a while to be seen, so instead her dad showered with her very gently after she took some children's Tylenol, and before it was her bedtime, not much later, she was moving her arm comfortably. Phew! We shall see how it is in the morning. </p>
<p>A rare day ... no spelling or piano for Riku. No time! He did do his homework, though, with Akane, and it took less than a minute I think, as it was very basic and easy math for him. He had been doing much harder math than that at Starr King, but this is the first year for the children here. </p>
<p>My back was telling me there was no way it could get down onto Riku's bed for story time; I was not happy missing out on this time at the end of his day, but his daddy tucked him in, and Riku was asleep at 8:15. Bryn went to bed at 9(!) tonight, Akane was on her computer, and so I sat making notes in my "bed" until just past 11 P.M. Here's to a better night! </p>
