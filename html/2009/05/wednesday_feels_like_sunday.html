								<h2>Wednesday ... Felt Like Sunday, and Then Came the Big Hole!</h2>
								<p>It felt like Sunday today, because Riku just had five days off, and tomorrow he returns to school. He's had his Baba here for a day, and Auntie Ayako for two extra days, so the time no doubt went by quickly for him. </p>
<p>Today we had a very early start, with Riku awake at 5 A.M.! He agreed to try to get back to sleep, but a half hour later I suggested he get a book and read for a bit. He came back with paper and pencil and sat beside me drawing quietly. The book came next and he had his banana while he read. We got up at 6:30, and met Bryn in the kitchen; everyone else was still sleeping, including Mirei, who finally woke after 7, very unusual for her these days. Riku, in the meantime, had kept busy and very quiet doing some cutting and pasting to make his own face, which he changed into his dad with the addition of eyebrows! </p>
<p>After breakfast the children played happily together in their bedroom for the longest time. Riku was helping Mirei clear her bed of all the toys, games, stuffed animals, and collection of myriad bags, purses, hair accessories, and doo-dads! Her part of the room reminds me of Caillie's: every single object, no matter how tiny or what it's made of — plastic, paper, cellophane — is precious, and must not go in the garbage! </p>
<p>Riku did his piano while Mirei had some time alone with her aunt upstairs. Bryn is, of course, working, as it is Tuesday in North America.</p>
<p>Late in the morning, Ayako and Akane went out to run an errand and I suggested they have lunch out together, as Ayako is leaving this afternoon at 2. I made up some fried rice for lunch, and heated up the cabbage dish leftovers to go with it. Bryn joined us for lunch today, and I had a tiny bit of pasta, also a leftover. </p>
<p>The plan was for me to take the children to the playground for a long stretch for all of us, but both of them were reluctant to go out. They were playing dress-up in their room and Riku happily co-operated with Mirei, as she made suggestions and helped him with it all, and then paraded downstairs to show him off to me. It was so funny and such a great rainy day activity for them.</p>
<p>Mirei walked around for most of that time with her "packback" loaded onto her shoulders, and usually two extra bags as well in her hands, all set with extra scarves and accessories to add to Riku's outfit. What a girl she is! I wouldn't be at all surprised if one day this girl walks miles on treks without missing a beat, volunteering to carry everyone else's bags! </p>
<p>I again suggested that we all put on our raincoats, take our umbrellas and go to the playground, but had no takers. Eventually though they decided to put on their rain gear and go outside to look for pill bugs in the front garden area. About fifteen minutes later,  they started arguing about some little tool that belonged to Mirei; Bryn asked me to have them both come in the house. We had been expecting Akane and Ayako home a half hour before, to say goodbye to the children, so it was time for a change anyway, and boy, did we get it! </p>
<p>Unbeknown to me, Riku had lifted a very heavy iron manhole cover off a sewage access hole, about four feet deep. (A few days later I asked him how he managed to move it, as it was really heavy. His answer ... he lifted it with some difficulty, but then kicked it off the rest of the way with his shoe.) Riku came into the house right away, but I went out for Mirei, and stepped right into that hole with my left foot and leg! Thank goodness it was me, and not Mirei or Riku, was all I could think later on! </p>
<p>What a shock this was, and what a very painful experience! It was all a blur, and I am not sure how I got out either, but was badly scraped along the top left side of my thigh, right down to my shin bone and ankle, something I didn't know until later. But, what really hurt was my back. I lay on my side moaning in agony; both children thought I was just pretending, and were laughing at my dramatic sounds! However, when I told them to tell their Dad it was an emergency, that changed fast; they both looked very worried.  Riku went running. Mirei stayed beside me, patting me, and telling me it would be okay. </p>
<p>Lots happened: Bryn sent Riku to his room, where he kept calling down to me from his bedroom window, asking how I was, Mirei was so concerned and sweet, staying right beside me, while Bryn was asking if he could help me up, what he could do, etc. But there was nothing for a good fifteen minutes, as I just could not imagine trying to get up. Finally, he was able to get me into a chair which he brought outside, and things went a little blank and blurry. The cars and roads and trees were all silvery and disappearing, and I felt so dizzy, but that went away after perhaps ten minutes. Finally, Bryn supported me while I hobbled into the house, and sat on the sofa, still moaning and hating to do so in front of the children. </p>
<p>Riku was allowed downsatirs, and stood crying beside me. Poor guy!  I asked if he would read me a story, hoping it would distract him and me, but he cried saying he couldn't and didn't want me to die. I felt awful for Riku; he has seen me hurt once before and that was his concern then too. I reassured him I would be fine in a few days, and Mirei asked why I kept saying "shoot".  :) It wasn't what I wanted to say, believe me! Mirei got a wet tissue and wiped the blood off and cleaned a small cut along the base of my thumb; in Mirei's mind that was my biggest injury. Blood! </p>
<p>Akane and Ayako got home about 2:15, about a half hour after it happened, and Ayako suggested that I get to a hospital even if I felt that nothing was broken. By this time I was just feeling awful and thinking some pain medication would help, if nothing else! After Ayako made a few phone calls, to a few facilities I gather, off we went, arriving at the hospital at 4 P.M. Ayako left us to continue on home to Osaka; she had been so kind, and I appreciated her going out of her way to seek help for me.</p>
<p>I was hurting a lot; I couldn't sit, and I knew I wouldn't be able to stand for long, and the fifteen minutes to get into an examining room seemed forever. It is a big facility, with lots of chairs and sliding office doors where the patients are seen, and it was almost empty from what we could see. However, there may well have been a patient behind each door! It was all very quiet and still. </p>
<p>Akane was there as my translator, and explained what had gone on. The doctor asked a few more questions and then a nurse accompanied us to the X-ray department a few floors up. There was a flat table, but I knew there was no way I was going to be able to get down on that, so they did four or five standing X-rays instead. We waited perhaps fifteen minutes after that, and the nurse gave me a "thumbs-up" as we walked back into the doctor's office. What a nice thing to do, as I was so afraid that I perhaps had crushed vertebrae, and knowing even a few minutes ahead of time that all was well was a huge relief. </p>
<p>Bottom line was that I stretched some back tendons in that hard fall down the hole, and it is going to take some time for it all to heal. I was wrapped in a big wide pressure bandage, which immediately felt like a good firm hug, and helped with the walking immensely! Before the appointment, I had been leaning heavily on Akane, as well as on the nurse's shoulder, and was then able to walk on my own, if carefully. </p>
<p>Akane had talked the doctor into ten pain pills, rather than the five he was originally going to prescribe, so she went off to get those, at the drug store around the corner, and I was happy to use the handicapped bathroom, with low and high rails(!), and even better, the wonderfully warm toilet seat that I fondly remembered from the condo in Osaka, as well as in many of the department stores. I haven't been in even one of those wonderful stores here yet. </p>
<p>The entire cost of all these health services, including the pressure bandage, was a mere $200! I can't begin to imagine what the hospital bill, with four X-rays, would have been in San Francisco. </p>
<p>So, home in a taxi ... the drivers here all wear navy blue uniforms, ties, and gloves, and open and close the door for you. The seats were covered in what to us would seem to be fussy "old lady" lacy but heavy cotton fabric. Funny what one pays attention to when one would rather not be concentrating on not feeling every bump in the road! </p>
<p>It seemed a long way home, but the cab fare was just Y1100, about $11.00, about half or less than I thought it would be. The children were very happy to see me, and both asked lots of questions about how I was feeling and admired my very large "bandage". Mirei kept patting me, rubbing me, and kissing the little scrape on my hand.</p>
<p>School the next day, so tubs with their dad, while Akane whipped up one her delicious dinners, and then somehow they fitted in piano and reading for Riku. It was a very busy couple of hours! </p>
<p>The bandage is making a huge difference in how I feel, and now I just want a good night's sleep. Sitting and standing are no fun at all. Bed at 10:30 p.m. </p>
