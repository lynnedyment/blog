								<h2>Tuesday ... Another Happy Encounter, and a Surprise Afternoon Snack</h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 6 A.M. today, sooner than he should have, but Mirei joined us at 6:30, happy to see us both awake. I sat with them while they ate their fruit bowls, and while Akane showered, we all ate eggs and toast. Akane set up the TV her mother bought yesterday, but after watching a bit about bento boxes, they went back to drawing and then got busy with a floor puzzle. This particular one is a 24-piece map of the world, and Riku has taught Mirei to jump on the countries, continents, or familiar place names, so she now knows Australia, Japan, Canada, San Francisco (there is a picture of the Golden Gate bridge), and sometimes she can find where Auntie Kelly lives too. </p>
<p>Both children put on their boots and went off hunting for bugs, in both the front and back of the house. They were successful and soon both had a small Styrofoam tray lined with leaves, twigs, and pill bugs. Mirei is not squeamish at all as she wants to touch them and inspect them just like her big brother. Riku was delighted when he found a small slug under a rock in the front garden area, and that hour went by very quickly for them! </p>
<p>By then Ayako was awake, so they were busy entertaining her. I hung up some laundry although it was looking and feeling a lot like rain. There was some alone time for me to tidy up my storage area in the room; I have lots of children's clothes to take home with me, and getting them right into my bag helps keep my closet area organized. Akane went off on her bike to pick up some groceries, while Ayako showered, and I put Mirei's hair into a little whale spout.</p>
<p>Soon it was time for a walk with Mirei while Riku did his piano practice, and Ayako joined us. We went up to the second playground, to see if we could find the same little boy who was there the other day, but instead there was a three-year-old girl with her dad. </p>
<p>Mirei is just so outgoing and friendly, and walked right up to them. Not much later she was inspecting the little girl's bag. Mirei had forgotten to load up with her own bags today, but she was very happy checking out the "cell phone", the change purse, and a second little wallet instead. It was very nice that the child didn't seem to mind this at all, although Mirei was generously sharing a little bag of candy with her. </p>
<p>I wanted to take Ayako to meet Mirei's "friend", the elderly woman with the snowman skirt, and she was outside hanging up her bedding! Mirei thought she looked very funny with her big glasses on today, something that perhaps she hasn't noticed before since we have always been closer to her, and Mirei could concentrate instead on her necklace and clothing. </p>
<p>Right next to her house is the big vegetable patch with peas growing so quickly, we can almost see the peas forming! How tempted we are to pick just one, but of course we can't. However, there was a fairly large group of people having a picnic/barbecue in the middle of this large garden area, and they were smiling, looking at Mirei, and finally waved their arms and "asked" us to join them! I am having so many of these nice encounters that I am not surprised any more, but Ayako was very surprised. </p>
<p>So, we walked around the corner, and noticed a woman who had just picked a big basket of fresh strawberries from her patch. Mirei smiled at her, and of course the woman offered her a bright red, juicy strawberry to nibble on, before we walked into the garden across the way. We walked up to this large friendly group, at which point Mirei decided to be a little shy. </p>
<p>That didn't last long though, as one man opened a new container of dark blue grapes and gave her a big clump of them, another offered her barbecued sardines (which she refused), and yet another gave her a whole closed container of dessert: white bread with the crusts cut off, spread with heavy cream, and layered with sliced strawberries! Most of the group came up to speak to us, and offering us all food. Ayako happily accepted a brochette of chicken and onions, and some sardines too. There were a couple left over, which Ayako was encouraged to take with her, and Akane told me later they were delicious. As we left we turned to give them all a big wave, Mirei called out goodbye in Japanese to them, and the whole group waved back at us. It is my favourite kind of interaction with the locals! </p>
<p>Not long after arriving home, Akane and Ayako went out for lunch together, and the children and I went up to their room to start clearing it up a bit. Riku wants everything in place, and works hard at keeping his side "ship-shape" as Mom would have said. Mirei finds new things to distract her at every turn, and has a great time with it all. </p>
<p>It was threatening to rain still, but Ayako had a hair appointment, and Akane had planned to take the children to the botanical garden, so they could spend more time with Ayako after that. However, Riku decided he wanted some quiet time at home instead; we had interrupted that time with his mom when we came back from our walk. </p>
<p>So, at 2 o'clock, the three gals left us, and Riku and I spent about an hour and a half in his room together. He was collecting all his loose Lego pieces together in one spot, tossing things he decided he no longer wanted (what a concept!), and I started putting Mirei's clothes in her numerous drawers. Bryn decided where the best spot for her bed would be, and that made a huge difference in the amount of floor space the children have for playing. </p>
<p>Riku went downstairs at one point, and came up, much to my surprise, with a snack for me! It was just the sweetest thing ... Bryn had found him trying to cut an orange with a regular kitchen knife, so helped him with that, but he had also peeled a banana for me, put both on a plate, somehow reached a tiny glass for me and carried it, filled with water, upstairs along with the plate of fruit. Bryn had assumed it was for Riku himself, and was as pleased as I was to learn later than it had been for his Nana. </p>
<p>Bryn popped in a video, "Dogs and Cats", for him as a treat, I went down to make tea, and after preparing a nice snack for him, joined him. He laughs harder and more when there is someone beside him enjoying it too. It was relaxing and fun to sit together in the quiet house, and I managed to get a bit more done in their room, before Akane and Ayako arrived home. </p>
<p>Dinner was an hour later than usual tonight, so Riku did his reading with Bryn before his tub, and Mirei did a little more printing while Riku tubbed. Dinner was delicious: a big plate of lightly cooked spring cabbage with garlic, and pasta with tomato sauce. </p>
<p>We're getting ever closer to the end of our book and read for twenty minutes tonight before turning off the light. It was 8:15, though, as he was quite congested once he lay down.  Akane and Ayoko went out for dinner, I did lots of emailing and some blogging, and went off to bed at 10:30 when they returned home. It was a busy, productive, but relaxing day. Oh, and it did rain, and all the clothes were on the line! <br />
