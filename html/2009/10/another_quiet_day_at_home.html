								<h2>Another Quiet Day at Home</h2>
								<p>A couple of weeks ago Bryn bought tickets to "Disney on Ice"; he and Mari thought it would be fun for Mirei and were they right! I don't think Mirei really knew what skating meant, but she was excited about the idea of seeing princesses, which she knew were part of the show. </p>
<p>She had a lovely long sleep again last night, and after stretching and a long cuddle in bed, the first thing she asked me was whether I was going to see the princesses too. I wasn't, of course, but knew we had to get moving so that she would be all set to leave at 9:30. </p>
<p>I told Mirei she could wear a dress today, since I knew it would be hot in the valley, and she chose her pink one. She looked as sweet as could be in it, and she won't be wearing sleeveless summer dresses for a long time. She and her dad go home in just five days. </p>
<p>The minute she had eaten her egg and toast she asked for a bowl of water, so that she could soak the gel capsule she had found that magically produces an animal. It usually takes a while for this to happen, but Mirei decided she didn't have to wait at all, but could instead just peel off the plastic, and voila! She was delighted to see the cow emerging ever-so-quickly. None of the other children have done this, but patiently waited and watched to see it take place over an hour or more. </p>
<p>I packed her up a snack pack, and off she went with Grandpa—to be dropped off at T'ai Chi—and then on to San Jose for the 11 A.M. show. Doug came home briefly before heading right back out to a movie, so I had the entire day on my own. I expected Bryn and company back about 2, so worked fast and hard at housework and even took some time to work on my family tree, a very rare event these days. Since they didn't arrive back until close to 5 o'clock, I got so much done, and my back let me know it, too. </p>
<p>Mirei came bounding into the house and started telling me about all the princesses she had seen, and described the sparkles on their dresses (short dresses, not long ones), and how one girl cut her long hair "cause she was protecting someone", and there were leaves made from lights on the ice, and there were princes and many many girls, and a fairy godmother. It all sounded very exciting and Bryn said it was just a perfect venue for her: she sat enraptured, paid lots of attention, and told Bryn that "sometimes the Beast (of "Beauty and the Beast") was nice and sometimes cranky." She knows her movies! </p>
<p>She was full of vim and vigour when she got home, and full of beans too. She imitated her dad's voice perfectly when he was on the phone, repeating the tone of voice he used when answering ... "helll lo therrrrre", making us both laugh, and then doing the same thing when he hung up ... "buh bye." And of course making us laugh makes her laugh, and so it goes on and on. What a character Mirei is! </p>
<p>We have a little game in our family, with this current generation of children, whereby they put their feet up on the table and I say in a stern voice, none of which is taken seriously, "Get those feet off my table." It started with Bryn and Caillie, and went on down to Riku and Amelia too. And now it's Mirei's turn, and how she loved hearing it again. </p>
<p>At one point, Mirei asked me what was "important". I was wondering how to define it for her, but she quickly broke in to tell me ... "eating good food is important", and "sleeping is important", followed by "Did you know Nana, that you grow when you are sleeping?" I told her I knew that, and she answered, "I did not know that." And the list went on ... "brushing your teeth is important", "not chewing hard candy is important, 'cause your teeth might break." Later I heard her telling her baby in the tub that she shouldn't eat hard candy and the baby said, "This is chewy hard candy, not (holding her hands in a claw) like this." I'm not sure where all this came from, and Bryn went out before I could ask him about it. </p>
<p>I did some recording of Mirei having a long conversation in the tub tonight. She often goes on for a very long time, most often in Japanese, although over the last week I have noticed she is talking to her babies more in English. And how her English has improved in just this month; I can't believe some of the expressions that she is coming out with these days. Tonight I was taking a peek at the paper, and she told me, "Put down your paper, Nana, and pay attention to me." </p>
<p>Mirei chose four tiny Winnie-the-Pooh books to read over the next four nights, but in fact we read two of them tonight. She had napped on the hour-long trip home, and so I didn't attempt to get her into bed for an hour later than usual, and then it took her forty minutes of lying in the dark to settle down. There was a lot of tossing and turning on her part before those eyes finally closed at 9:10. I was more tired than usual, too: housework is more taxing than playing in the playground! </p>
