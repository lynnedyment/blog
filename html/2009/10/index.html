								<h2><a href="/2009/10/bryn_and_mirei_arrive.html">Bryn and Mirei Arrive!</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn's and Mirei's plane touched down a half hour early this morning, and we were there to see those smiling faces as they walked through the gate. Mirei had her hair cut last month, and the shorter more structured cut is adorable on her. Bryn looked fit and well, and had a great flight with Mirei. He said not only did she sleep for four hours, not something he was sure would happen, but she napped in the limo on the way to the airport, and was a delightful traveling companion: happy, entertaining, and quiet. I'm sure their seat companions nearby appreciated that too! </p>
<p>Mirei walked in the house and within minutes was back doing just what she always did ... serving us "breakfast" from the little kitchen area, tending to her two dolls in the cradle and stroller, deciding to draw me a picture, followed by asking to paint, then use the Play-Doh, and finally ending this morning's activities by going off to the living room to read on the sofa. Whew! </p>
<p>Bryn left with Doug after noon to pick up his rental car, and was heading straight off after that to Murphys, a very small town in central California, to meet up with groom-to-be Brent and others for the pre-wedding guy party. Mirei gave him a big hug when he left, and gave her Grandpa a big hug too. </p>
<p>We puttered about, doing this and that downstairs. I was busy with laundry, too, and she was happy to just poke about rediscovering old toys. The bag of various necklaces came out and Mirei was busy stringing those around her neck, but decided not to use any of the necklaces with shells on them. Interesting. They would have been Riku's first choice!  </p>
<p>She had Doug busy catching and tossing a ball to her at one point, and then she joined me upstairs while I was having a quiet cup of tea. We decided to just drop the ball from various heights into each other's hands. I got lots of snuggles in there too! She pulled Bryn's old play farm up on the bed  with us and she chatted away about animals, and Old MacDonald, singing the song too, of course. </p>
<p>The afternoon passed quickly, Mirei ate a hearty late lunch, and then we walked over on this bright sunny warm day to the playground on Potrero Avenue, singing nursery rhymes as we went.</p>
<p>We passed a funky car on the way, and Mirei posed very prettily beside it after noticing I was just going to take a shot of the car! </p>
<p>Once at the playground, she climbed, went down the slides, climbed up on the big structure there about halfway only today, and used all the other playground equipment too. We walked home slowly, with Mirei stopping to poke a small stick into whatever holes in the sidewalk and walls that she could find. About a half block from the house, she declared she was tired, but didn't ask to be carried. She must have been soooo tired after such a long, long day. </p>
<p>I popped her into a warm tub with bubbles and two "babies" to wash and shampoo, and made her up a big dinner of eggs, "bacon", half a bagel, corn, and edamame. I was pouring her some milk and realized she hadn't said a word; I just assumed she was busy eating, but instead found her slowly drifting sideways, as she was off to sleep! I wanted her to eat more than she had, but it was no use at all. She managed a couple more bites, once I put her on my lap, but then she snuggled into my shoulder, I carried her off to bed, and shut the door at 7:45. I do hope she sleeps through the night and wakens happily adjusted to the time change, but we shall see. </p>
<p>Such a sweet loving girl is Mirei! We all got lots of hugs and kisses throughout the day, and as always she had us laughing at her antics. How she loves to make people laugh! </p>
<p>I'm a bit jet lagged myself, mostly because I didn't sleep long enough the last few nights before leaving Ontario, so it's going to be an early night for me too. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/jet_leg_and_the_bay_area_disco.html">Jet Leg and the Bay Area Discovery Museum</a></h2>
								<p>Much to my surprise, Mirei slept in until 9:45 this morning, a fifteen hour jet lag recovery! She awoke at 1A.M. and I joined her in bed, but she slept right through, long after I had left her room. I even managed to get a photo of her and she didn't budge! </p>
<p>It was a perfect San Francisco day; the sun was shining, the weather was warm, no wind, and the sky a beautiful blue, with no clouds. So, after quite a leisurely two hours at home, Mirei and I headed off for her first day's adventure, to the Bay Area Discovery Museum. Half an hour later, with heavier than usual traffic, Mirei was sound asleep! I let her sleep for a while in the car at the museum, but she finally roused with the comings and goings of the other cars. </p>
<p>We had lunch immediately, our usual picnic fare of a grilled cheese sandwich, and filled out with goodies I brought from home. I was surprised that Mirei chose to go to the indoor activity area first, rather than playing outside, but it was quiet and relaxing there today, with fewer people around than usual, so she quite enjoyed people watching at the clay table. </p>
<p>Not much later the craft room opened, and Mirei happily joined in, making a puppet face with a paper plate. It's interesting to see what a people watcher Mirei is! In both places, and perhaps moreso today because she was tired, she often just sits and observes others around her. She loved gluing pink "hair" onto her plate, and added eyebrows and lashes to the face too. </p>
<p>Her next stop was the toddler area. My guess is that she is going to be too tall for this spot next year. I hope not, as she still loves to meander from room to room there, jumping, lying, and relaxing on the water lily ponds, buzzing about the small climbing platform next door, and moving fast between the two. She made me laugh out loud when she spread out her legs over three areas of the place where she can make the frogs' bubbles visible by stepping on them. Too bad she didn't have a middle leg for this, as she managed to really stretch out those legs! </p>
<p>We spent a lot of time there, until I reminded her that the fish stream was outside, and that used up another half hour of our time. Before we left that area, she stopped to use the little chalkboard, and wrote her name, Nana, Riku, and Mommy all by herself. A fellow who works there, and had recognized her from previous visits (even asking where her big brother was!), was amazed. She likes to print too, as Riku does it and she wants to be just like him. All her favourite things were fitted in, ending with climbing on the boat, going through the giant log, climbing up the log steps all by herself, and ringing the bell several times at the top of the hill. </p>
<p>We left just as the museum was closing, at 4 P.M., so there was no time for the rolling pennies table today, but I promised her we would be there earlier next time. She managed to stay awake on the way home, and we stopped at Rainbow for a few groceries. </p>
<p>Mirei was practicing catching a big ball today with both Doug and me, and we did more practicing this evening. She's improving steadily and is very proud of herself!  Later she told me she liked my garden and went outside on her own, riding on the trike for a bit, and taking her babies out for a stroller ride. </p>
<p>We had dinner before the tub tonight; her baby got another hair wash, as did Mirei, and the bubbles were out too during tub time. It was a nice relaxing end to our day, and she was tucked in at 7:40 tonight. </p>
<p>At 10 o'clock Mirei woke up. Even though she is lying quietly, with me beside her for over an hour, it seems that sleep is eluding her, so I am off to join her now, at 11:30. That wee cat nap must have given her some extra mileage! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/saturday_felt_like_a_sunday.html">Saturday ... Felt Like a Sunday!</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei slept until 10:33 this morning! Even though she was awake for perhaps an hour and a half after 10 last night, she still slept twelve and a half hours. She has done so well with this adjustment to West Coast time, and stumbled into the kitchen squinting and smiling. After a cuddle and some hugs on my lap, she went right to her little kitchen to get me something to "eat", just as though that was her duty. I prepared eggs, toast, and "bacon" for us while I was served fruit and juice. She obviously knows me well. We had a very lazy morning, and Mirei watched "the green Caillou" while I showered just before noon. I must say I love mornings we don't have to dash off.</p>
<p>We didn't have much in the way of plans for today at all. It's the weekend and often the places we would like to go to are very busy. We did have casual plans with Susan to possibly meet up at Ocean Beach this afternoon, but set off after lunch to a Vegetarian Food fair near Mirei's Japanese nursery school. As we drove her by the school, we noticed the door was open, so stopped to see if Mirei's teacher was there. She was, and greeted Mirei with a big smile. Mirei was quite shy with her, but did want to go inside the door. The teacher and her husband were decorating for Hallowe'en, and so Mirei saw a little bit of that. We made arrangements for Mirei to go to school on Fridays, from 9–1, and then she will go on to play with Jonah, a little boy from her class, after that. Right now Mirei is saying that she doesn't want to go to that school, or to go to Jonah's house, but we shall see how she is feeling closer to the day that will happen. </p>
<p>The Vegetarian Fair was interesting, and Mirei was quite happy trying out various samples of yogurt, vegan cookies, tofu, veggie "chips", juices, and coconut ice cream. She also picked up some stickers and chose a poster of healthy food choices, done in a cartoon style, that is now hanging in her room. There was a friendly gal who invited Mirei over to colour, so she did that, and chatted away with her, telling her her name, and her brother's name, and their ages. </p>
<p>It was quite windy and she had Doug carrying her to and from the car for part of both trips. I had my Sudoku book in the car with me, and while I was sitting in the back seat with her, she practiced her numbers, telling me each one correctly. I hadn't realized she knew her numbers so it was fun being her "teacher". </p>
<p>We drove to Ocean Beach for the sand castle contest, but it was 4 P.M., the tide was coming in, and there weren't too many people on that blowy beach. I even sat in the car while Doug and Mirei got out to see if we could spend a little time there, but it was just too cold and windy. </p>
<p>On the way home, we stopped at the playground at the top of Noe Valley, and spent forty-five minutes there. I was cold, but Mirei was quite happy going down the slides, having Doug push her on the swings, and watching all the birthday children gathered there. </p>
<p>Mirei got right into the tub when we got home, I made pasta for dinner, and then we practiced catching the ball ... she's getting better and better, and is now tossing it into the air and catching it regularly, and reading on the sofa. She had gone in the living room before me, while I cleaned up the dinner dishes, and I found her sitting quietly in the corner chair waiting patiently for me. </p>
<p>It's such a pleasure to share our days with this little girl. There wasn't an unhappy moment in her day from morning until night and those smiles just keep on coming. She's such a good little companion. Mirei has her Grandpa and me grinning away, and it's obvious she enjoys entertaining us; I just can't imagine her not here with us. </p>
<p>Sound asleep at 7:35 tonight, snuggled up against me, with her nose touching mine! Such a pleasure from that first sleepy smile to that last snuggle. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/tilden_park_day.html">Tilden Park Day</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei slept until just after 8 o'clock today, giving her a solid twelve and a half hours of sleep. I think the jet lag is over and she has settled into a regular sleep now. As soon as she saw Doug eating his breakfast this morning, she decided she wanted to eat exactly what he was eating, so it was a container of yogurt, a cinnamon raisin English muffin, and juice for her, or at least for the first course of her morning meal. </p>
<p>She watched "a different Caillou, the blue one" today while I showered. Later, while she was making lots of party dishes for me in the kitchen, I told her Daddy was coming back today, and her reply was "Today? Tuesday?!";  I learned later from Bryn that Tuesday is her day of choice when she feels driven to name a day. </p>
<p>I am hearing lots of "Oh my goodness" and "Oh my gosh!" from this little girl lately, as well as many other expressions that sound like me. </p>
<p>It has been a long time since we had Mirei at the little steam train ride in Tilden Park in Berkeley, so I packed up a picnic lunch and off we went. First stop was the "Redwood Valley Railway Company" and we lucked out in that the smaller, and free train was running when we got there. We had to wait a little bit for the steam to build up, and it was chilly standing there, but once on the train we were in the sunshine and it was much more pleasant. </p>
<p>We were able to get on the larger train immediately and Mirei pointed out every small building along the route. There was a group with five children sitting behind us, and as always Mirei spent a lot of time observing them, able to tell me later how many were boys and how many were girls. She doesn't miss very much, this girl! </p>
<p>It was time for lunch and so we drove close to the small farm in the park, enjoying our lunch sitting on a bench in the sunshine. Mirei was anxious to finish up and play in the playground, so after half of hers was finished I let her run off and come back for bites. There is a series of small climbing rocks here, and Mirei climbed them all. She did a great job except that she insisted on climbing down the last foot or so standing looking out! </p>
<p>We played ball for the longest time, using a small pink ball someone had left behind. We bounced it, rolled out, and tossed it over the course of the hour we spent there, and had lots of fun. Then it was time to stroll off to the little farm, a much larger area than Doug remembered it being from many years ago. Mirei saw cows up very close, goats, sheep, turkeys, both wild and domestic, ducks, chickens, rabbits, and rams, and managed to find a few pieces of lettuce and celery to feed to two cows. </p>
<p>On the way home, Mirei asked me to point out the numbers in the Sudoku book I had in the car, so with the point of my pencil, I was the "teacher" and was surprised that she recognized the numbers to nine. She hadn't known them when she went to Japan in March, and so it was the first time I realized that she had learned them. </p>
<p>We sang lots of songs on this trip and Mirei has started doing what Brynnie did when he was a little guy ... making up the words for new songs. I recorded her doing this yesterday, and wish I had gotten my camera out today to do more of it. Once home we continued singing, and just before Bryn came home, about 7:15, we had been singing about the ducks not coming back. She will have this down pat within the week I am sure. </p>
<p>Tub time, of course, and then dinner, since she had snacked on the way home with her leftover lunch, and then Bern, Bryn's friend, came over to say hello to her just before her bedtime. Mirei was thrilled to bits to have her here with her, and they played with all the "food" and dishes in the little kitchen, making more party food as she had this morning. Guess we have a party girl on our hands! </p>
<p>I took Mirei off to bed, just as Bryn and Bern were leaving for a concert. It was 8:15 when she fell asleep; it took her a little longer to settle down after her excitement of having both her Daddy and Bern here. She told Bryn she missed him <strong>so</strong> much, and she was <strong>so</strong> glad he was home. He looked mighty pleased himself, after having had a great weekend wedding celebration with Brent, Mikela, and all their guests. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/a_visit_with_finn_and_amelia_t.html">Visiting with Finn and Amelia</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei slept for eleven hours last night, so we are back to a more normal sleep routine for her. That was an easy transition for her jet lag, sleeping right through for four nights in a row, and an easy transition for us too! </p>
<p>Finn came over for a visit at 9:30 this morning. He and Mirei played together upstairs and in the kitchen, but also spent some time on their own ... Finn with me in the garden, and Mirei with her doctor's kit bandaging up animals in her own room. </p>
<p>Susan showed up at noon with two bunches of pinky-coral tulips for me, as well as big deli sandwiches and two bags of chips for us all to share. The sandwiches were so big that Bryn and I both ate just half, as did Susan; the children had already eaten eggs and toast and so weren't hungry. Nice to have a "picnic" that someone else made! </p>
<p>We made arrangements to meet up with them at the 23rd street playground after Finn's nap, and after Amelia was out of school for the day. Mirei is always happy to play with Play-Doh, so we did that for a little bit, she played with her babies, we went outside to do some sweeping, but the highlight was taking her tricycle out on the sidewalk, so she could peddle up and down all by herself. It was hard going in the backyard, as she had to keep steering in circles, and not all the leaves & garden debris have been picked up yet. Mirei was very proud of herself, as she went all the way up and down our block on her own (except for some help on the slight hill going up and slowing her down on the way down!). </p>
<p>I wanted to give my back a break before going on to the playground, so she and Doug sat at the table while she wrote out the alphabet for him. She came up to show me her handiwork, and to point out that Grandpa had done the other drawing on the page. Mirei is always happy to write or identify letters and/or numbers, so it's easy to entertain her when we have a few minutes to put in. </p>
<p>We drove to the playground just after 3 P.M., and Mirei was delighted to see Amelia. Me too! She has gotten taller and looked very grown up in her school uniform. She and Mirei played so well together, and later all three children started pulling up "weeds" in the grassy area and pretending it was soup in Mirei's hat, used for a pot! </p>
<p>One of the children from Riku's grade one class came up and said "Hello, Riku's grandmother"! And then his brother came up and asked if I was Riku's mother. It was Justin and Jonathon(?), and we talked for a little bit, and then I introduced myself to their father, José, and filled him in on how Riku was doing. Justin and his family had been to México in August, so they weren't around when Riku was here, as was true of so many of his classmates. However, Justin did give me his address, and his dad says he will write and draw pictures for Riku for certain, as he enjoys doing both. </p>
<p>Susan sent me home with a bag full of magazines, for both Doug and me, licorice for me, chocolate mints for Doug, and a cookbook from the farm they go to as a family every year. Doug read out a couple of recipes to me that sounded good to him! </p>
<p>After Mirei's tub and dinner, Mirei said she would like to do a puzzle. We went upstairs together and instead of a puzzle she chose three alphabet/number sets. So, we sat in the living room with the large alphabet cards I had given her two years ago, and she read off each one to me, checking to see where the little girl with the red hair was on each. Then she chose the rubber alphabet board and put all the letters in backwards just for fun. And it was fun, as she would pretend to hide a few of them, raise her eyebrows and ask me where it was, claim that she didn't know, and then produce it with a big chuckle. What a girl! Our last evening event had Mirei tipping out rubber numbers from a mat and then having her ask me for each of them, carefully placing them in the right spots. Mirei liked being the "teacher" for this last one! </p>
<p>She was tucked in and asleep by 7:25 and I dozed off for ten minutes myself. Busy days.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/were_going_to_the_zoo.html">We're Going to the Zoo!</a></h2>
								<p>I woke up at 6:30 this morning, and even though I was very quiet, Mirei woke up at the same time and decided she had to go to the bathroom too. I was sure that was it, that she was awake for the day, but I was amazed that just minutes after snuggling back into the duvet, Mirei was breathing quietly and slept for another hour. I dozed on and off, and was watching her sleep when those eyes opened up. She always looks over and smiles, as though questioning whether it's okay to be awake, and today when I answered her "good morning!", she said "That was <strong>fast</strong>!", meaning, I assume, the night. Perhaps she thought it only lasted that one final hour! </p>
<p>Mirei had suggested yesterday that we go to the zoo, but I thought Doug had something going on today that required him having the car. I was wrong, and so the zoo was on after all, much to Mirei's delight. I decided we would spend the morning at home, and head out after lunch, avoiding the need to carry our lunches around the vast zoo grounds. </p>
<p>I had some cards and letters to write, so after Mirei had time with her "babies", and I cleaned up the kitchen, I joined Mirei while she watched "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".  In between watching the bits she had questions about, I got quite a bit accomplished. This worked well and it gave me a chance to put my feet up too, before the busy afternoon got started. </p>
<p>Mirei asked if she could ride her trike this morning, and so Doug took her out, up and down the block again, although Doug said today she was more interested in a more exciting ride, perhaps standing on the seat while he pushed her! Guess she feels she has that pedaling down pat. </p>
<p>We got to the zoo at 1 P.M. and left just after 4. We covered a lot of territory during that time too, and still didn't see the bears, all the Australian animals, or the tigers, so we will go another day. We did see lots, though ... the male lion wandering about, the baby gorilla climbing on a biggish rock, while his mom looked on ... and then disappeared on him, causing him to slide down off the rock head first, scrambling after her. </p>
<p>The giraffes were wonderful to see, as always; Mirei pointed out the zebra, and now knows that male peacocks are the ones with the pretty feathers. Today Mirei was determined to climb on every animal sculpture she came across, and I think I got photos of every one of them! </p>
<p>We went to the farm area, and Mirei got up the courage to feed the rambunctious goats, with some help and security management from Grandpa. She did a great job, though, and for the last two-thirds of the feeding she was keeping her hand nice and steady and not minding their being a little aggressive. Mirei enjoyed watching the tiny chicks, not long ago hatched out, and felt the woolly sheep too. </p>
<p>I think her favourite part of the zoo of all today, though, was watching a tiny alligator, who was sitting on a turtle, and then watched as the zoo keeper picked him up so that the turtles could be fed. She spent a lot of time moving about and peering into the water to see them, and watched an owl for a long time too. We should probably take her once a week while she's here just so she really gets to know her animals. Today she showed so much interest in so many of them. </p>
<p>We all spent some time watching the gophers today; Mirei grinned away as she got to pretend she was one of them. And she seemed to enjoy watching the meercats too, just like her Grandpa, who finds them fascinating. </p>
<p>A special big treat for her today was candy floss, the first time she has asked for it. Before buying it, though, we went into the café so she could eat a yogurt for her mid-afternoon snack, visited the farm area, and then she had the floss. Interestingly, even though she really liked it, it wasn't too long before she handed me back her last piece and said we should save some for another day. It will be interesting to see if she asks for it tomorrow. Riku likes it too, but ate even less of it than Mirei did, before saying he didn't want any more of it. </p>
<p>On the final leg of our day at the zoo, Mirei decided to ham it up. She pulled her arms out of her shirt, and walked the rest of the way out of the area with her shirt up, patting her belly, posing with silly faces, and walking backwards. It was just hilarious and she attracted lots of attention, which just egged her on. What a girl! I think she needs a t-shirt that says this! </p>
<p>I could see that Mirei was close to drifting off in the car on the way there, so we opened our windows up a bit, and did a little game of naming letters and numbers. This kept her busy and happy, and she was active and busy all the time we were at the zoo. On the way home she went back to the paper and pencil drawing and naming letters, and she wasn't even close to drifting off, much to my surprise. </p>
<p>Bryn bought a new skateboard today, and Mirei was so very interested in it. I don't know if this bodes well for the future, what with her desire to stand on her trike at this stage! Bryn put her on it in the kitchen and she grinned away as he scooted her up and down the kitchen area. I got a video of it too, which made her laugh. </p>
<p>Mirei has been playing with Play-Doh a lot during her meals; it's a treat for her to just sit and roll it, press out shapes, and blow out little circles using a hollow tube. It's one of her favourite pastimes and there is lots of it here for her. </p>
<p>Quick tub time after dinner tonight, and then I read her the first of the seven stories from "The Everyday Story Book" that I won when I was in grade one. All of the grandchildren know these stories, and of course their parents too, so I'm glad I remembered to read Mirei "Sally's Lost Shoe" tonight. She enjoyed it very much and we shall continue with the rest of the stories this coming week. </p>
<p>It was a grand day, and the weather was perfect for it as well. Our busy girl was asleep at 7:35 tonight, and I got lots of emails cleared up. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/a_quiet_day_with_mirei.html">A Quieter Day with Mirei</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei slept eleven and a half hours last night, waking at 7:10 this morning. We stayed in bed for a half hour after Mirei suggested "Let's just snuggle", just as her brother always did. I burrow down and listen to all the morning chatter. Riku liked to read as many books as we could on mornings like this, but Mirei is happy to talk about what we did yesterday, or what her animals are saying. She has been sleeping with a soft yellow and white dog, who sports a bandage from her administrations on Monday, so we talked about how he was coming along before we got up and on with our day. </p>
<p>Mirei snuck quietly down the hallway to check on her Daddy and just as she turned to leave, he growled and in she went to burrow with him for a while. During breakfast, Bryn and Mirei demonstrated a very silly thing they do together. Bryn points his finger at something specific and then Mirei, instead of looking where he is pointing, instead looks at his finger and says "I don't see butterflies ... or books, or whatever. Then they switch and Mirei does the same with Bryn. It is so funny to see and I must tape it sometime soon. Mirei often tells me funny things her dad does, and I think it amuses Bryn to hear me tell it to him later on. He obviously makes a very big impression on this little girl of his, and has passed on his own quirky silly sense of humour too. </p>
<p>We had a quiet morning at home.  Mirei watched a Caillou tape she hadn't seen before, while I took a long shower and tidied up a bit upstairs. Of course I always watch some of the program with her, as she likes company as much as Riku does. It's always fun to hear what they have to say about what's happening on the screen. I love to see her smiling as she watches the interactions between Caillou, his mom and dad, his sister, and his cat Gilbert. </p>
<p>Mirei likes her reading time, just as Riku did, but we always sit in the living room. She tucked a pillow behind both of us today, as we read four books, but decided she would rather share mine that use her own. She chose a new alphabet book today and goes over each page until she knows each new word for the letters. </p>
<p>Between her two breakfast courses we did some ball catching practice again, and what a difference a few days has made. Mirei was able to stand way back by the fridge while I sat in the kitchen area, throwing the ball to her and having her catch it! She did these long catches at least five times in a row, with lots of other good catches along the way, and she was one proud and happy little girl. </p>
<p>Doug went off to join Bryn for lunch at the newly changed (once more) Roosevelt Tamale Parlour, so Mirei and I went off with her trike to the mailbox. I can see what Doug meant about her wanting to do more interesting things with her trike, now that she has mastered the fine art of peddling and steering much much better too. Today she wanted to put one foot up on the back of the trike and use it like a scooter. I bet she would be great at that! But she went two full blocks today so certainly had her exercise peddling more up the slight rise than she did yesterday. </p>
<p>Once Doug was home he sat with Mirei while she wrote out the alphabet again, and I went upstairs with a hot cup of tea and read for twenty minutes. I must put up a photo of her printing as she is very proud of her letters and even circles the nice points on the capital A to show us she has done a good job there. </p>
<p>After that we did a Costco run, followed by a trip to Rainbow for major grocery shopping. Mirei is fun to have along with us, as she behaves very well and quite enjoys the whole experience. </p>
<p>Doug had to stop at Safeway for a few more items, so dropped us off at the newish playground on Bryant Street. Riku had been there in August, but it was Mirei's first time and it was a huge hit.  She spent lots of time in the toddler area, standing on the train calling out "All aboard!" as she did on Sunday at the park, bouncing with some bigger girls on a three seater bouncer (I have no idea what they are called), but then she discovered something new and exciting, and went to work figuring that out. It was a series of round rubber steps suspended by ropes, and she really had to concentrate to hold on to the swinging ropes and moving steps before moving on to the next one. But she just kept at it, doing it over and over again, until by the time Doug joined us, she pretty much had it down pat. I was so impressed with just how determined she was to get it right, and was so sorry I had forgotten to bring my camera along today. I will get back there with her though, as she would have been happy to spend more time. </p>
<p>Bryn was home and not busy working when we arrived, so he and Mirei had some silly fun times together. He put her on top of the fridge, made her howl with laughter while she was eating dessert, practiced ball throwing and catching with her, and was amused by her as she took hold of the door stop and used it as a microphone to sing us a very long complicated made-up song. </p>
<p>Bryn had been chatting with Akane on IM and arranged to have her put Riku on Skype with us. What a treat this was! Mirei was so happy to see Riku, her Baba (Akane's mother, who was visiting), and especially Akane. It was hard for Riku to get a word in edgewise, so Bryn took Mirei off to read for a few minutes so that I could talk to Riku on his own. </p>
<p>They had a typhoon in Japan and he was very excited about it. He slept with Akane last night, and said it was much quieter in the tatami room where she sleeps; I guess the wind must have been howling.</p>
<p> It was wonderful to see and talk to Riku, as it has been too long since we last managed a visit via the computer. He always looks so much older to me, and I love the way he talks and looks right at the camera so I get a good look at him.</p>
<p> I told him I had met Justin at the playground, and we managed to chat for a few minutes before it was time for him to leave for school. He never likes to rush and so said goodbye so he could leave ten minutes earlier than usual. Mirei did come dashing in and said "goodbye sweetie" to him! </p>
<p>Mirei has caught a cold! I noticed her nose running a bit towards dinnertime, although it didn't curb her appetite or her sense of humour one bit. However, with all the antics going on, we were running a little late for tubbing tonight, so skipped it. I knew she wanted to read the next story in our book, and she very much enjoyed hearing about Ben, Helen, their dog Dasher, and the little kitten Graysilk, who was the new member of their family. Once that was over, though, she asked if she could please look at the other pictures in the book and went over last night's story again too. </p>
<p>As we snuggled for a few minutes after turning out the light, Mirei said to me "Nana, I love your clothes, I love your back, I love your curly hair, and I love you very much." When I say "goodnight sweetheart" to her, she comes right back with the phrase for me, and it just makes me want to weep. </p>
<p>My back hurt so much last night when I lay down with her that I moaned out loud, and instantly Mirei put her hand on the small of my back and told me that would make it feel better. And of course it did! Tonight she asked me if my back hurt, and when I told her it did, she asked me to lift up so she could put her hand on it so it would get better. What a sweet thoughtful girl she is. I hope she always remains so sensitive to others. </p>
<p>I walked out at 7:35, with Mirei sound asleep, and after making some popcorn, went upstairs with Doug to watch part one of "Five Days", a five-part BBC drama. It was so good and ended on a real cliff hanger, so I suggested we watch part two as well. I must say that if I didn't have things to do downstairs I would happily have sat and watched part three as well! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/mellow_day.html">Mellow Day at Home , with the Blue Angels Overhead</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei woke just after 7 A.M. today, another eleven and a half hours sleep for her. Today we hid under the covers so that Doug could find us, just as Riku did from the time he was a very little guy. And how she giggled, giving away our hiding place instantly! It didn't matter a bit; as she was still delighted at being found. </p>
<p>Days are busy with this little girl, right from the moment she wakes up. She's like me, happy to chat away from the very beginning of her day until the end of it, when I have to remind her that it's time to slow down and relax and get ready to sleep. But it's all systems go when those big brown eyes peer into mine to make sure I am awake. She's incredibly thoughtful, as she lies there quietly beside me until I open my eyes, never waking me. However, as I was with Riku, I am very much aware of those eyes on me, and that face just inches from mine. Such a sweet awakening this is! We have started stretching in the mornings, reaching up to the ceiling with our arms, stretching our legs down as far as we can, and ending with a nice back stretch too. </p>
<p>Mirei enjoyed a poached egg on toast this morning, eating up every bite, and then asked for hot chocolate, as I had. Of course we got out her pink cup for this special treat, and I do hope it's something she will always remember. I bought this sweet set at a farm auction when Kelly was a young girl, and the cups have been used by many children over the years. </p>
<p>Doug was giving a talk in the East Bay, and had to leave at 10:30, Bryn had left at 7 for a meeting in the South Bay, and so Mirei and I were home on our own. We accomplished so much: I vacuumed this level, while Mirei "worked" up on my bed, keeping busy with her cell phone, and running up and down to tend to her babies, and to chat with me,  multi-tasking as women do. Later on, I joined her and did some paper work, so she came downstairs to get her paperwork too. Busy us! </p>
<p>After we had lunch, we sorted out a big stack of cards, getting the pairs together, one pair for each of us at a time. I had another stack of flash cards for numbers, and just for fun pulled those out, and how Mirei loved calling out those numbers to me ... "four plus nine!", "seven plus eight!" and she laughed so hard when she took a turn with me, and I made mistakes. She caught them immediately and gave me that look with her eyes to make sure I really was just teasing. </p>
<p>The Blue Angels were practicing for Fleet Week today and we were lucky enough to see them fly by twice in our big oval bedroom window. Mirei's response was like mine: "Wow!". I saw them in Toronto and never tire of seeing them streaking by, and Mirei didn't mind the noise, thank goodness.</p>
<p>Doug got home in mid-afternoon, so Mirei and I went off to the playground at the top of the hill for an hour and a bit. The sun was warm here, but it was cooler on the hill, though Mirei was happy wandering about, swinging in the swing as high as she has ever asked me to push her, going up and down the enclosed slide and taking great pleasure in not letting me take her photo(!), and playing with some other children, a few of whom were very nervous about the planes, and one child who cried. Mirei always looked up with interest as they were making shapes in the sky and that interested her very much. </p>
<p>I popped Mirei in the tub right away, as Doug and I were going off to a reading tonight, courtesy of a birthday gift for Doug (and I get to be his guest!). I made a "hamburger" stew tonight, one of Mom's recipes, and Mirei ate a huge portion of it. There were lots of veggies in it already, so there were no side dishes for her tonight. </p>
<p>As soon as dinner was over, Mirei printed the alphabet, something we try to do each day. For whatever reason, she decided it would be funny to write the tiniest little letters and I was astounded at how much control she has to do them and yet make them so very clearly too! She thought it was funny too, and grinned each time she did another. She also learned tonight that NO spells "No!", that OK spells "OK", and that HI spells "Hi". The first two are a joke, as I have four big plastic letters on the kitchen wall, and Mirei knows that OK is really OK, but it sure is fun asking her to spell three words and having her do it, with that little face glowing. </p>
<p>Doug had gone off to his T'ai Chi class and came home in time for a very quick bowl of the stew, and Bryn came in just before Doug and was busy eating when we left, after many many laughs between those two! How I love the interaction there. </p>
<p>Mirei was very excited about having her daddy home with her, and was very busy entertaining him with all she had done and seen today. She showed him how she could do the number cards, and he was very impressed with how fast she was! I found out later that he read the first two chapters of the Everyday Storybook to her, leaving us to read the third one tomorrow night. </p>
<p>Our reading/conversation with Nick Hornby and David Eggers was just fantastic. Both of them are very well spoken, entertaining, and friends to boot, so it was a casual fun informative two-way conversation. Doug thought it was the very best of all this particular series he has ever attended, and I certainly enjoyed it as well. </p>
<p>It was a lovely day, from morning 'til evening. I can't imagine my days without this dear little girl in them! Today she asked me why I loved her, and I told her because she was funny, she was kind, and she was thoughtful. Then she asked me to ask her why she loved me(!), and the answer was "because you are smart, you are funny, I like your clothes, and you are always nice." That's a great way to end my day, by remembering this sweet exchange. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/little_angels_morning_and_an_a.html">Little Angels Morning and an Afternoon of Baking</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei woke at 7 this morning, but wanted to "just snuggle for a while, Nana" before getting out of bed. So we did, and a half hour later it was time to get hustling! Bryn was taking her off for four hours at Little Angels. I was a little concerned that she would decide she didn't want to go, and I wasn't looking forward to her being upset about it. But she came through like a trouper, and showed no hesitation at all about getting there. Breakfast was a little more hurried than usual, but she ate two scrambled eggs, instead of her standard one poached egg, and ate some yogurt as well. Bryn said that she didn't look back when he walked her in, but headed right to the back of the room. </p>
<p>Bryn had suggested that I book an appointment with Valerie, the acupuncturist I see occasionally (but not as often as I should). I intended seeing her right after my fall in May, but I couldn't imagine being able to get up on the treatment table or moving around with any degree of comfort, and then life got busy. So, today was the day, and it was very successful. Valerie worked on all the areas of my middle back that still trouble me, especially if I am not putting my feet up often enough, and after two hours I left her office feeling so much better. That night in bed was the first night (after busy days) that I didn't moan even to myself as I lowered myself down.</p>
<p>I went home for a quick bite to eat, and picked Mirei up at 1:30; I even had to wait a few minutes as she was "working on somethin'." She didn't talk a lot about her day, but I did learn that there is a new teacher there, a man, and that a little boy said something rude to her. "That's not very nice, right Nana?" I don't think it was anything too serious though.  </p>
<p>As soon as we got home, she suggested "let's bake somethin''" and even had a suggestion as to what to bake: gingerbread cookies. Mirei is a baker! We agreed that we wouldn't make gingerbread men, but instead would make smaller cookies in different shapes. So hands washed, aprons on, and we were busy for the next two hours. Not only did we make the gingerbread dough (though will make the cookies tomorrow), but we made date squares too. </p>
<p>Between baking sessions, as we waited for dough and dates to cool, Mirei used her female multi-tasking skills and took care of her baby. This boy baby was not very co-operative about getting dressed, so I took a series of photos of that event, as well as the baking and this, and the next two blog entries will show how busy we were today! </p>
<p>Bryn was home working for the day upstairs and while I prepared dinner, he took Mirei out for the first time to see her on her trike. They were out for a nice long ride, which Mirei thoroughly enjoys. She knows she needs "exercise and some fresh air, right Nana" and this is a fun way for her to get it on busy days. Mirei took a tumble while driving over a bump in the sidewalk, but she came in and told me she didn't hurt and she didn't cry. Her leg was a bit scraped though, as I noticed in the tub later on. </p>
<p>Bryn was home for dinner with us tonight, and we had a stuffed pasta—tiny raviolis—that Mirei has been asking for each time she opened the fridge over the past three days. We had a fresh tomato and fresh mozzarella cheese salad but Mirei claims not to like tomatoes, so had three side veggie dishes instead, and lots of the ravioli. </p>
<p>Mirei was asleep at 7:45 tonight, after reading the third story in our new book. Tonight's story was about Skippy, a little dog who goes into the house next door to his and is on his own there for three days and nights. Mirei is very interested in all the little details and can tell her daddy all about it the next day. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched the next two episodes of our British mini-series. One to go. I was relaxed and tired and didn't get any emailing done today at all. One day... </p>

								<p>While the various parts of our baking project were on hold ... the gingerbread was cooling, waiting for the eggs to be added, and the dates were cooling ... Mirei was busy dressing her baby boy. The pictures tell it all: he was sitting so nicely for Mirei until she started dressing him!</p>
<p>Mirei is very maternal, sweet and kind with her babies, kissing and cooing at them. However, when Raggedy Andy acted up—he pinched his sister, Raggedy Ann—she gave him a "time out", leaving him downstairs and not allowing him upstairs with them until "later". Bryn and I love to watch her mothering them all, including the various animals too. </p>
<p>When she was bandaging the animals a few days ago, I asked her if she wanted to be a doctor when she grows up. I know it's what her mommy and daddy are hoping for her. She thought about it for a minute or two and then said "I think I want to be a Mommy." Perhaps she will be able to be both. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/date_squares.html">Mirei Bakes Date Squares</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei and I baked date squares, using my Mom's recipe from many, many years ago. I used to bake these at home when I was a teenager, and of course continued to bake them after I was married and had my own children. It is one of the first recipes hand-written in my over-forty-year-old collection of recipes. They are a family favourite, and Mirei decided she likes them too. Here is the original recipe:</p>
<p>1 1/2 cups of flour<br />
1/2 teaspoon of baking soda<br />
3/4 cup of melted butter<br />
2 cups of rolled oats (I use the finer, rather than the coarse flakes)<br />
3/4 cup of brown sugar (I use just a scant half now)<br />
1 pound of pitted dates (I remember going to the store for "dates without pits") as a child and being worried that I could only find "pitted dates", which I thought meant that they had pits!)<br />
1 cup water (I use perhaps a cup and a half)</p>
<p>Sift flour and baking soda together and add rolled oats, the sugar, and melted butter. Mix thoroughly. Set aside.</p>
<p>To make filling:<br />
Cook together the pound of dates with water added to them. Cook on a low heat, stirring occasionally, until the dates soften and break down to a soft mass. Cool.</p>
<p>Grease either an 8×8" pan or—as we prefer them to be thinner and with more of them!—a 9×13" pan. Divide the rolled oats mixture in half and spread one half on the bottom of the pan. Press down with hands or the back of a wet fork. </p>
<p>Spread cooled date mixture over the surface, filling in the corners, and then press down with a fork to even it out. Spread remaining oats on the top, smooth it out, and then press with the back of a wet fork. </p>
<p>Bake at 350ºF just until golden brown, perhaps for a half hour. Do not allow to overcook. Cool before cutting into squares. Enjoy! </p>
<p>(If using a glass pan, lower the heat by 25ºF degrees; my Mom told me this and sure enough, later on, in Home Ec' class, I learned that this was good advice.)</p>
<p>For a different square, especially at Christmas, replace the dates with mincemeat and follow the same recipe. </p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/happy_6th_birthday_amelia_and.html">Happy Sixth Birthday, Amelia! ... and Gingerbread Cookies, Too!</a></h2>
								<p>Amelia turned six today and we had made plans to go to "Jim's Restaurant", one of the local Mission Street "greasy spoons" that we have all been going to over the years. </p>
<p>Mirei had awakened at 7 this morning, which gave us lots of time for her to have the first part of her breakfast and to make a card for Amelia. She did a great job on it, working with her tongue sticking out as she concentrated on getting it done to her satisfaction. There were stickers involved as well as printing names, and pictures too, of Amelia, "baby Finn", Susan, and Kevin too. Bryn sat with her and made a colourful  "autumn princess birthday girl" crown for Amelia. </p>
<p>Since Doug was at his T'ai Chi class, Bryn skate-boarded to the restaurant, and Kevin drove over at 10 A.M. to pick up Mirei and me. Kevin got the biggest hug and a kiss from Mirei, who also told him with her big smile, "I like you Kevin!" She sure does, and always has. It was sweet to see them holding hands, crossing the street to the restaurant a few minutes later. </p>
<p>We met up with Susan and the children kitty-corner from where we parked and all the children hugged each other. Bryn was waiting for us, and in a few minutes we were sitting in our usual big horseshoe-shaped booth by the front window. Amelia looked darling in her crown, and Mirei and Amelia had a great time, just chatting away, and at one point putting lip gloss on each other! We had eggs and toast and hash browns, tea and coffee, juice, and presents too for Amelia to open. </p>
<p>I walked home on my own, for my own fresh air and exercise, and Bryn drove Mirei home in Kevin's car. </p>
<p>Mirei asked if we could "bake something", and there was just enough time for us to roll out a small portion of the gingerbread dough and bake cookies, before Susan, Kevin, and the children arrived. It was delightful watching Mirei roll out the dough, press the cutters into it carefully, pull the dough away from the cut areas, and lift them carefully onto the tray. She has had so much practice with Play-Doh that she knew just what to do. She even got to deliver a freshly baked cookie upstairs to her daddy, and one for Grandpa too. And of course she sat down with a glass of vanilla soy milk and a big cookie for herself.  </p>
<p>We finished up just before Susan and the family arrived. They were off to Vancouver this afternoon at 4 o'clock but dropped by at 1:20 with a delicious cheesecake and candles for Amelia to blow out. The children had a little playtime together, and then it was time for hugs and wave-goodbyes from the window, as Bryn drove them all to the airport for their eight-day trip away. </p>
<p>I had some tidying up to do in the kitchen, and took time for a quiet cup of tea too, while Mirei watched Caillou and "worked" with Bryn upstairs, where he was working. </p>
<p>Just before 4, I called up to see if Mirei wanted to go to the playground, and of course she did! It was fairly quiet when we got there, but more and more children came along, and then Oona and Karyn, our downstairs neighbours, came by. Oona is nine months older than Mirei, but over the summer has grown so tall, and has become quite daring too, jumping off the side of the slide! I just cannot imagine Mirei doing this next year, but I suppose there is a good chance she might. They had lots of fun together and with another little girl too, and we all left at 5 o'clock for home. </p>
<p>Mirei wanted her dinner first, so had a big bowl of stew, with custard and strawberries for dessert. Bryn sat with us too, eating some leftovers Susan had brought over, as he has dinner reservations for 10 P.M. with Mari tonight, after an 8 o'clock concert at the Brava Theatre in the Mission. The three of us had fun with the rubber alphabet and number puzzles while she ate. Mirei has them all down pat and we put them in backwards again tonight, just 'cause she can. </p>
<p>Tuck in time at 7:15 with another new story. Mirei now knows that there are seven stories for the seven days of the week, and tonight's story was called "Teddy's Sailboat", my least favourite of all of them, but still a very cute story with a turtle, a butterfly, and a frog all turning down offers from Teddy to sit on his toy sailboat. Finally his friend comes along with a little sailor doll and the story ends happily for all. </p>
<p>Our little one, smelling of coconut cream, which she loves to help me put on after her tub, was asleep at 7:35, Doug and I watched the final episode of our mini-series, and I got to start the sequel to the book I enjoyed so much when I was in Ontario: "Too Many Men". The sequel is called "You Gotta Have Balls", an expression that surely comes from the main character's father. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/rolling_out_the_cookies.html">Mirei Rolls Out the Cookies</a></h2>
								<p>In the hour and a half between celebrating Amelia's birthday at the restaurant, and here with a cake, Mirei and I got busy rolling and baking the gingerbread cookies. Mirei has had lots of practice rolling "dough" with Play-Doh but this was even more fun as she got to taste a little bit of it too! The dough is quite hard when it is cold right out of the fridge and we both had hold of the pin at one point, rolling together. But I told Mirei it would soften up soon, and it did, so she got to roll it all by herself. She did a great job placing the cutters so that they filled up the space, taking care that the edges fit in too, and then she would press down hard, saying "wiggle, wiggle", wiggling not only the cutters but her body too! I tried hard to get this on tape but didn't manage to; perhaps I will the next time. We had agreed not to make gingerbread men, but she did cut out two or three little tiny girls and a couple of angels too, and they required eyes, noses, and a smiling mouth, as well as buttons. Using a chopstick and a spoon Mirei managed to get the decorating done too. Here are a few of the photos from this afternoon. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/a_productive_day_at_home_but_m.html">A Productive Day at Home, but Missing Mirei</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei had a breakfast date with her Dad and Mari early this morning. She woke up just before 7, but lay quietly beside me while I came to, and then we had our morning stretch and chat. No rush to get out of bed for something to put in that tummy, so we relaxed and then got up and got her dressed, ready for when Bryn pulled up with Mari at 8 o'clock. He had left a half hour earlier to pick her up, and Mirei was excited about spending time with her. They went off to "Just For You", their Toronto cousins' favourite breakfast spot too, and it sounds as though she liked the beignets as much as they do. Bryn said she was a delightful little dining companion, polite, making conversation, and eating well.</p>
<p>They all came back to the house about 9:15,  and while Bryn did two hours' work upstairs, Mari and Mirei went into her room to play together. I had Mirei's bedding in the wash already, and sat having my breakfast with the Sunday paper while the two had their quiet time together. Mirei came out to collect the coloured pencils as she was showing Mari how she could spell lots of words, and wrote Mari's name out too. We will have to include that in her spelling "tests" from now on. </p>
<p>Just before they left the house at 11, the two of them were in the bathroom with Mirei helping Mari put on her makeup. Yesterday she and Amelia were putting lip gloss on each other, and today Mirei got some practice in putting on eye makeup. She was quite serious about it, and it was sweet to watch. </p>
<p>They left for an oyster bake at the Tomales Bay Oyster Company, a birthday party for a casual friend of Mari's. Bryn thought they would be back about 3:30 but it was closer to 5:30! I had lots I wanted to work on, including tidying off my kitchen counters, and working on my emails and blog entries. </p>
<p>Doug worked really hard on my behalf cropping photos for my blog postings; there have been  lots of photos over the past two days and it was great to have a block of time to work on the postings and get those photos up in them. When I needed a break from the computer, I went back to my counters and was very pleased with all that I accomplished. I took two tea breaks too, reading with my feet up, so all in all lots got done around here.</p>
<p>However, this house was much too quiet! After about two hours I realized how much I am going to miss Mirei's company. She makes me smile and laugh, and I get outside too when she's here! Instead I got through lots of emails, sorted and tossed paper that came back with me from Ontario, and was anticipating Mirei's arrival. </p>
<p>And in she burst, with a big big smile, telling me she patted a cat, and fed it too, and rolled down the grass with lots of children. They had a great day and Bryn filled me in on the rest of it, with lots of photos to show me too. The weather was a little warmer north of Marin, on the coast, which was good, as it was cool enough here that we turned the heat on towards the end of the afternoon. </p>
<p>Mirei had tiny ravioli with pesto tonight and told me "I like pasta and I like pesto!" and ate every bite of it with gusto. She is so good about eating all her veggies too, broccoli and carrots tonight, and then was ready for her tub. </p>
<p>We have been using coconut cream on her skin and how Mirei likes to help put it on herself... on her tummy, chest, and legs tonight, while I covered her arms and back and the tops of her feet. After she brushed her teeth, I put some on her cheeks too. She was all pink and white and smiley and sparkling, looking ever so sweet in her PJs. I took out the camera to snap a few photos and she insisted I take one of her looking sad and one of her looking happy. Funny girl, is our Mirei! </p>
<p>Bryn went off to see a movie with Sean, and Mirei and I snuggled in to read "The Make-Believe Picnic" which she thoroughly enjoyed. The daddy in the book is a bit like her daddy and she liked that he was silly. He pretends the dining room table is a lake, and the stairs are a big hill, and everyone laughs. It's a lovely little story about having to make do with a picnic in the attic when the rain spoils their plans for an outdoor picnic, but I know that Mirei is really looking forward to tomorrow's story: "The Lost Teddy Bear". It's one of my very favourites and I know that she is going to like it too. </p>
<p>Bryn had told me that Mirei was a lovely travelling companion as well; she was on the plane trip over here, and in the back seat of the car, on her own, she sat for almost an hour completely absorbed in looking at all the books she insisted on taking with her. Then she napped for a half hour before they got there. On the way home, at her request, Mari sat in the back seat with her, which meant she stayed awake the entire way home. Thank goodness, as that earlier half-hour nap meant she had trouble falling asleep tonight, despite her very busy day running about in the fresh air. I crept out of the room at 8:15 tonight, but I know that tomorrow she will be back on schedule again. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a one-hour recorded TV show, and I got back to my emailing. Bed at 11 tonight so that I can read my new book. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/a_new_playground_today.html">A New Playground Today!</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei woke just before 7 A.M. again today, so this seems to be her official time for now. Having her asleep by 7:30 continues to be my goal, and it works out well for us. It gives me three and a half solid hours to catch up on emails and write my blog entry, and still have time for a short TV session with Doug if we have something on the go. </p>
<p>I do love waking up beside this girl, as she puts her face very close to mine, and whispers good morning to me, making sure that I am really awake. Then I hear "good morning, sweetheart" or "good morning, sweetie" before we start our now usual stretching routine. And Mirei has started anticipating Grandpa coming in and finding us too, something Riku enjoyed on his once-a-week sleepovers for a few years, right up to his visit here in August too. </p>
<p>Mirei ate a big breakfast today, and then went off for a car drive at 9 with her Dad to pick Mari up and drive her to work. Mari had forgotten her wallet in the car yesterday, and Bryn hoped to buy doughnuts at a place near her office. Mirei told me when they got home that the doughnut place was closed today. It is Columbus Day, and so some shops and the government are not working. </p>
<p>We spent the overcast morning here at home, with lots of activities taking place. Mirei painted, we read <strong>twelve</strong> books in the living room, Mirei recited off the words she knows how to spell and went over the letters of the alphabet in one book she especially likes. She told me she would like "melted cheese with bread" for lunch, a grilled cheese sandwich, so I suggested we go for a trike ride first and then have lunch. She said "that is a good idea. We need exercise and fresh air, right Nana?" She's with the program! </p>
<p>Today she peddled hard and fast right up to the mailbox and insisted on carrying her trike on her own across the road. I managed to get a video of her peddling home, but she ran out of steam a half block away. Doug and Bryn sat down and had grilled cheese sandwiches with her, and after lunch Doug, Mirei, and I headed off to a new spot Doug had found when he was volunteering at a radio station in September. McLaren Park is a huge acreage just on the outskirts of the city, and there are two playgrounds scattered about, tennis courts, a swimming pool, two small lakes, a creek, a marsh, a redwood grove, an amphitheatre, and lots of hiking trails. The property is both flat and hilly, so it's a perfect place for a family outing. There are lots of picnic tables scattered about as well, and I thought how much Riku would have enjoyed this spot. Next time ... </p>
<p>We went to the two playgrounds and Mirei certainly got her exercise in this afternoon. She has become very willing to try almost anything, and so climbed up sloping wide steps to the top of play structures, as well as flat ones, an off-balance tiered set of steps, and a swinging rope set too. She kept herself very busy running up and down, sliding down, and climbing up the slides. Now that she has learned how to do this, she is determined to try it on every new slide she sees, and today she found lots of new ones. </p>
<p>Mirei found flowers, blew out some dandelion seeds with Doug, patted a tiny puppy, who had very sharp tiny teeth(!), and she and Doug found some places on a bridge where they could step and make music. The sun never did come out today, but it wasn't cold, just cool, and perfect for Mirei running about. </p>
<p>Tub time as soon as we got home, followed by "those tiny little pastas again" with peas on the side. This girl loves her pasta and had it with pesto, another favourite flavour. Bryn was with us for dinner and he and Mirei shared lots of laughs at the table. He deliberately changes words so that they are silly, and Mirei instantly picks up on them, and laughs so hard while she corrects him. Then he pretends he didn't hear her correctly, comes out with another silly word or phrase, and sets her off again. I love her laugh and one can't help but laugh along with her. </p>
<p>We finished dinner nice and early tonight, and so there was time for Mirei to become a "bag lady" once more, a favourite pastime, packing herself up with her yellow lunch bag, her pink backpack and a flat Barbie container of paper and stickers, I believe. She has been doing this for a long time, and always reminds me of her cousin Caillie, who is also very fond of stuffing things in bags and carting them about. </p>
<p>There was even time for a second round of painting; she found a bag in the laundry room stuffed with new things to use when painting, and was very happy to sit down and do a second, and quite different painting tonight. This last one is a pastel, very different from her darker one this morning. She is very proud to have them hanging in the kitchen, next to the one that Riku did when he was here.  </p>
<p>Bryn told her if she did her bedtime routine very quickly tonight, that I would read her <strong>two</strong> stories, and she co-operated very well. So, we got to read about "Bingo, the Lost Teddy Bear" (my personal favourite) and also "Mumpsy Goes to Kindergarten" which may be Mirei's. It is a sweet story and I'm so glad she enjoyed them all, as that is the end of the book. She may want to hear them again, though, before she leaves at month's end. </p>
<p>I walked out of her room at 7:35 tonight, although she woke up crying at 9 with her legs both sore and itchy from some really nasty mosquito bites she had when she arrived. A few of them are infected, and even though they seemed to be healing and haven't bothered her, for some reason tonight they flared up. However, after I put some cream on them, she was back to sleep within minutes. Poor wee girl; she is not happy about those mosquitoes and I'm glad the cold weather means the end of them when she gets home again. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a forty-five minute recorded TV show again tonight, and then I got to work on the photos for today. Bedtime already, though; the time just flies by too quickly! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/pennies_and_puddles_and_hallow.html">Pennies and Puddles and Hallowe'en Windows</a></h2>
								<p>It's raining, it's pouring... at last! It started up last night, our first heavy rainfall since last May perhaps, and it was lovely lying in bed listening to it as I drifted off to sleep. Mirei woke just before seven o'clock and after saying good morning, said "Listen Nana! Do you hear something?" Yesterday I had told her there was no mud to play with at the playground because we needed rain to go with the dirt, and so she was quite excited about the possibility of mud today! </p>
<p>Apparently, this is the tail end of the typhoon that hit Japan a few days ago, and given that it was really gusty and pouring rain hard most of the day, I can only imagine what the winds and rain must have been like there. </p>
<p>Doug and Bryn were both out of the house until mid-afternoon, so Mirei and I had a quiet few hours on our own. We both watched part of "Dumbo", with Mirei paying attention to her dolls and with me puttering about here and there, finishing off some chores, both up and downstairs. At one point Mirei packed herself up with her backpack again, her lunch "box", a soft cloth bag and the stroller looking ever so much the part of the very busy mom. </p>
<p>I promised Mirei that after lunch we would decorate the windows, and while pulling out the decals, I came across all the Hallowe'en books too. Mirei was delighted with them, and sat for at least a half hour going through each one thoroughly. By then I had the windows cleaned on the inside, and we spent the next half hour with Mirei carefully placing them where she could easily see them. We sang one of our favourite Hallowe'en songs, and certainly Riku's very favourite one that starts off "It's Hallowe'en, the lamp is lit... " </p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon passed quickly; Mirei used the fallen petals from the tulips as decorations on my stovefront, using lots and lots of pieces of Scotch tape to make sure each one stayed in place. It looks quite lovely! Then she did a "painting"by rubbing the petals against and up and down the paper and she quite enjoyed that too. We got a lot of mileage out of those petals! I didn't get a photo of it fast enough though, as she then went over it with markers and it's hard to see what the original looked like... very soft and delicate. We will try to find more flowers with more colours and do this again. We turned over the page, and did a dot drawing; Mirei started off with one of the "stamper" markers, doing a particular number of stamps, then I would follow with a different stamp but the same number, and so we were filling up our page quite nicely when Bryn walked in. </p>
<p>I wanted to get her outside for a little change, and so she, Doug and I went off to Costco, and then stopped at Safeway and the post office. We found some great puddles in all three places, and Mirei and I jumped in as many as we could, although with her frog puddle boots on she was a little more enthusiastic in her jumping. However, besides these big puddles, Mirei found a penny, and then found another in the car. This always makes her very happy and it reminds me of the few times I dropped pennies on the sidewalk for Riku to "find". </p>
<p>Mirei is learning to spell and tonight at dinner we spelled out a few words using the rubber letters. We're a bit restricted as we have only one of each letter, but it was fun and Mirei was keen. She called out letters from a few of the pages of the books we read today too. I keep thinking how Kelly would love to have this keen little girl in her kindergarten class. The youngest of her pupils are Mirei's age, as they too will turn four before the end of the year. </p>
<p>Mirei found a small table cover today and used it as a fashion accessory, winding it first around her waist, then around her neck, in two different ways, and finally around her head, with a little help from me to get it to stay put. She spent quite a bit of time admiring herself in the kitchen "mirror", the window of the lower oven. Mirei gets warm quickly though and soon had it off and moved on to other activities that kept her cooler. </p>
<p>We booked flights for Ontario today, for both Doug and me, and booked me for Japan as well. We are now waiting to book Doug, as soon as he finds out about some possible dates for classes next month. Nice to have that settled although I am not going to have much time for organizing at either end of the trips to and from Japan and to Ontario, but somehow it all works out. I just have to start making serious lists tomorrow! </p>
<p>At dinner tonight, Mirei brought up for the first time the age old question about death. She asked me if I was going to die one day, and I told her yes, but not for a long long time. She was upset for a minute or two, protesting as children always do, that they don't want us to die. The conversation didn't last long, thank goodness, but I know it will be brought up again sooner or later. </p>
<p>I made a potato omelette for dinner tonight, and Bryn was here with us. He had Mirei laughing so hard; she is such a great appreciative audience for his particular brand of silliness. They are such a funny pair, and along with that sense of humour is Mirei's very loving personality. Everyone gets big impulsive hugs and kisses throughout the day, along with proclamations of her love. Bryn said he will take every bit of all this loving while it lasts. Hard to imagine Mirei being an indifferent teenager one day, but one never knows.  :) </p>
<p>Mirei was asleep at 7:45 tonight, and I went up to watch a taped show, with my feet up. My back is very sore tonight, perhaps because I lifted Mirei a lot today for some reason. It's hard to resist though, as she is a cuddler for sure. And when she knows my back hurts, she is quick to put her tiny hand right on the sore spot at my waist, and often strokes my head, whispering quietly "shhh, it's okay, it's okay." I think she is going to be a wonderful doula one day! She's quick with the words, the pillows behind the back and the concerned expressions too. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/randall_museum_and_amy_tan.html">Randall Museum and Amy Tan</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei was lying quietly beside me this morning, watching me until I opened my eyes, not quite awake after a restless night. Now that I am booked for both Japan and Ontario, my mind was reeling with all that I have to do in the next two weeks and then in two days between those trips. Not that thinking about it helps at all, and in fact it would be much better if I just slept and saved all that energy for the next day when I could actually do something about it! I was very grateful that Mirei was happy to snuggle next to me for an extra fifteen minutes or so. I am always aware of her watching me, waiting for me to roll over and say good morning to her. </p>
<p>After breakfast we went upstairs; I got started on some ironing and Mirei watched a few Pingu episodes. She really likes me to sit beside her and watch them, though, and of course I am only too happy to do so. Today she had her cereal upstairs for a "special treat", as she had eaten her egg and toast earlier downstairs. </p>
<p>We mixed butter up before lunch and it was the first time Mirei had helped me with this little chore. She carefully unwrapped the butter, turned my slow mixing bowl around and around, and added the oil carefully. When it was time to scoop out the remainder of the soft butter at the end of it all, she held the spatula with me and helped with that too. There is now enough butter in the freezer to do us until the New Year. </p>
<p>Doug took Mirei off to the Randall Musem this afternoon, giving me three hours to get at some chores around the house, and tend to some paper work too. They had a great time, and Doug took lots of photos. She especially enjoyed patting the bunnies but also spent some time with two very young children which is always fun for her. She's gentle with them and the moms are always very complimentary about this loving part of her personality. </p>
<p>I needed a break and some fresh air, so once they arrived home Mirei and I went outside to do some gardening work. We swept, and picked up a huge number of pine needles there hadn't been room for in the composting bin this week, and it looked much better after that was done. Mirei enjoyed it as much as I did, and then was ready for her tub. </p>
<p>While I made dinner, Bryn sat with her while she called out numbers from the flash cards we discovered the other day. She is good at it, and laughed when Bryn kept telling her to do it "faster, faster!". </p>
<p>Dinner was over nice and early tonight, and Mirei had time to make me some fruit and tea, and then time with Raggedy Andy and Raggedy Ann. Once again, Raggedy Andy was in trouble for pinching and she gave him quite a talking to. That Raggedy Andy! He never seems to learn! </p>
<p>Bryn tucked Mirei into bed tonight and just before doing so, I had a question for her. Here's the story:Mirei has been sleeping in the smaller of the downstairs bedroom, on her own, until I join her sometime after 11 o'clock. She usually, but not always, wakens about that time and cries out for me. I go in, tell her I will be there soon, and back to sleep she goes. So for the past few nights I have been asking her not to cry but to just roll over and go back to sleep, knowing that I would be coming to bed with her soon. Mirei always looks thoughtful about it, and I thought she had the idea. So, tonight while she was waiting for Bryn to read to her, I asked her what she was going to do if she woke up and I wasn't there, and her immediate answer was "cry." We all howled, perhaps not the wisest thing to do, but it was so funny!  I reminded her she was to just go back to sleep and I would be there when it was my bedtime.  </p>
<p>Doug had won two free tickets to an Amy Tan roasting tonight, actually called a braising as no one wanted to be too tough on her. It was a great evening. I was so tired, I would have been happy to stay home, but have only seen Amy once before, many years ago at a reading. I wasn't tired sitting through all the funny and sweet speeches and songs, though, and the evening ended on such a great note, with Roger McGuinn of "The Byrds" singing four of his big hits, with Amy joining him for "Mr. Tambourine Man", playing the tambourine. </p>
<p>Bryn was in with Mirei when we got home at 10:30, but emerged soon after, telling me that Mirei had fallen asleep just shortly after 8:30. I was wondering if she might have trouble nodding off tonight, as she had napped for fifteen minutes on the way home from the Randall Museum with Doug, and that is enough to give her a second wind.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/hot_muggy_day_after_the_big_st.html">Hot, Muggy Day After the Big Storm</a></h2>
								<p>We woke to a very gray overcast sky but no rain, much to our surprise. It did look as though it could start up again at any time, but it didn't happen, and in fact during the afternoon it got really muggy and hot, with clear blue skies. We did set records for heaviest single-day rainfall yesterday since 1963, with over two inches falling in San Francisco, and over three along the southern coastal areas. There were lots of accidents, thousands without power throughout the Bay Area, and fallen trees and many branches landing on cars and houses. </p>
<p>I had a Hallowe'en parcel to get in the mail for Riku, and I asked Mirei if she would like to write a letter to him at the same time as I did. So of course she did that, telling him she missed him and drawing a picture for him on the back too. I also packaged up a gift for Kaitlin, and got some more sorting done in bits and pieces over the morning. Mirei kept busy with her babies, as usual, and today told me that Raggedy Ann had a dirty diaper. I grabbed the camera and took a few photos of her wiping Ann's bottom with a wipe, and by the expressions on her face during the clean-up, it wasn't the most pleasant of experiences. How funny this was to witness. One would think that there really was an odour present! </p>
<p>As I was preparing lunch, another meal of stuffed ravioli at Mirei's request (she can now open the freezer door and have a peek in there herself!), I pulled out the button box and Mirei had a grand time. Riku and Amelia both loved sorting through all the old buttons I have collected, and I have very fond memories of doing the same with my grandmother's buttons. Mirei decided to pull out all her favourite ones, the ones that didn't look so obviously like buttons ... four holes in each of them, for instance, and when it was time to put them away made me promise not to mix them up with the others. </p>
<p>This promising is a brand new behavior, just the second time I have heard her use the term. When I told her I would not put them in with the others, she made me look right at her and say "I promise I won't"! </p>
<p>Bryn had been working in the valley today from 6:30 A.M. and was due to come home at 1:30. Mirei and I had been out for a half hour on her trike, and that's when we discovered just how hot it was outside. Our house stays fairly cool, and even though it was warm inside, we weren't prepared for the change in temperature from yesterday. Mirei came in and changed into a skirt and a short-sleeved peasant-style blouse, which she told me her mommy had bought when she was "just a teeny weeny baby." Not sure if this is true, but it sure was a cute story. </p>
<p>Bryn said it was an Ocean Beach day for sure, but it was too late for that, as I know she would fall asleep on the way home for certain. Mirei was keen on going back to the playground with the moving steps near Safeway, so off we went. It was very quiet there, and very hot too, as it's a new playground with no mature trees for shade yet. Mirei went right to the steps, doing them over and over, and has really gained confidence and skill. There were two older girls working on them as well, and that just spurred her on to do it well. </p>
<p>A sweet little girl named Lila was there with her mom, and she was as interested in Mirei as Mirei was in her. Mirei was very chatty, telling Lila's mother not only her name, but how it was spelled, and where she lived, and that she had a mother and a big boy in Japan, and he was her brother and he was six, but she was three, almost four, and she misses her Nana when she is in Japan and I miss her too, but her Daddy said she would come back another day. It was hilarious to hear her fill this gal in on her life! </p>
<p>She and Lila had so much fun together, swinging side by side (which is where the conversation took place), and continuing on to the train and the sandbox too. We went to the car to get our big bag of sand toys, but it was so hot there, and I was keen to move on to the cooler playground on our hill. </p>
<p>This was much much better. There were a few children there for Mirei to play with, and especially two little girls, one a little younger and one a little older. The three of them had lots of fun, and I'm sorry I didn't get a photo of them all together. </p>
<p>We left the playground just before 5 o'clock and then it was tub time, dinner time, letter practice time with Bryn, and then tuck-in time with Bryn too. </p>
<p>Again tonight I asked her what she was to do if she woke up and I wasn't there, and once again the immediate answer, without missing a beat, was "cry." So we went over the ideal scenario once more. One day it will kick in, I'm sure. </p>
<p>Doug and I had tickets to a "conversation with Wallace Shawn", courtesy of Susan and Kevin, as a birthday gift for Doug. It was very interesting as not only is Wally Shawn a writer and director, but a very funny man as well. Some of his answers were a bit long, given that I was feeling so tired tonight, but I was glad I hadn't missed it. </p>
<p>I was pretty much "done in" when I got home, and since Bryn was still sleeping with Mirei, not surprising given his late night to sleep last night and his very early rising this morning, I decided to sleep upstairs tonight. I'm heading up for bed at 10:30, ready to relax with my book and turn the lights out soon. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/little_angels_and_bread_and_wa.html">Little Angels and "Flour and Water"</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei and Bryn both awoke this morning at 7 A.M. I awoke a half hour earlier and came downstairs showered and ready to get this little girl off to her Japanese nursery school program. She has been quite keen about it, and was looking forward to going again this morning. The house was already warm, so off she went in the same little outfit she wore yesterday, knowing she would be plenty warm enough in what was obviously going to be another hot day. </p>
<p>Bryn drove her to school again, pointing out all the old sites she recognizes, and drawing her attention to new ones too, the latest being palm trees. For the past two or three days she has been telling me each time we passed a palm tree, something Bryn told her about on their way to Tomales Bay last Sunday. </p>
<p>Mirei is picking up on new words and expressions so quickly these days, and is very eager to learn the right way to say things, placing her tongue exactly how we tell her to, and repeating a phrase over and over in the few days after she has heard it. </p>
<p>I have started a long list of things that need to be done before my two trips, but had to take care of some phone calls today, and some photos for Gail that she wants to copy. Doug and I went through the pics of their trip here last November, and Doug will get busy cropping those soon. How I would love to have two solid weeks to work just on photos, but instead I take dozens a day and it's hard for Doug to keep up with those these days, never mind get to the much older ones. All in good time though. </p>
<p>I wrote a letter to Riku, and sent off a postcard I had picked up for him from a booth at the Toronto book fair, featuring "Where the Wild Things Are". I know he will like the bookmarks I enclosed with the card too. I have a few more letters that need to be hand written and must try to get to those tomorrow. </p>
<p>Of course my four hours alone here flew by, but I was also looking forward to two hours at the beach with Mirei. I packed up a filling snack for her, and walked in to find her dressed in a princess dress, along with four other little girls, and Mirei not wanting to stop playing! So, there I was with almost an hour and a half on my own. I hadn't had lunch, so walked to a wonderful bakery called Arizmendi, just two blocks up from Mirei's school, ordered a slice of their always tasty pizza — today's flavour was spinach, cheddar cheese, & mushrooms, with garlic oil and parsley — and a big cup of milky tea, and sat very happily for the hour working on Sudoku puzzles. I have been keeping a book of them in the car for such rare occasions as these when I have a few spare minutes. I gave a minute or two thought to how much more I could have gotten done at home, but then just gave it up and relaxed and enjoyed this forced leisure time. </p>
<p>Mirei was a happy little camper when I picked her up, and chatted all the way home. She told me they don't do letters in Japanese school, or numbers, and they don't play games, but they do sing and play with the children. Sounds perfect to me. </p>
<p>We had made plans to go out for pizza tonight, Bryn's treat, to a spot that has been getting rave reviews. However, it is on the other side of town, where parking is often impossible, and so Bryn suggested we eat at another spot that has also been getting great reviews, called "Flour and Water". Bryn has eaten there before and liked it very much, and since it is in the Mission, it wasn't more than a ten-minute drive there. We arrived at 5:05 and there were two couples in the line, for the 5:30 opening. Doug stood and held our place while we went off to find a place to park. Within the two minutes that parking took, there must have been ten more people in the line, and there may well have been twenty-five there by the time the doors opened at 5:30. </p>
<p>Mirei had a little walk up and down the street with Bryn and me while Doug waited, and so she was happy sitting quietly and well behaved during dinner. She drew pictures for Doug and me, nibbled on Acme bread with olive oil, declined the wonderful fall salad and the tiny roasted and perfectly seasoned Brussels sprouts, but thoroughly enjoyed the Margherita pizza. Bryn and I had glasses of a delicious dry red wine as well, and we all shared a single but generous portion of a dark chocolate pots-de-crème-style dessert as well. Doug took Mirei for another walk outside while Bryn and I finished up our wine, and Mirei presented me with a big handful of bougainvillea petals that she had discovered on her walk. It was a fabulous evening out for me, and I enjoyed it so very much. </p>
<p>Mirei was tired, and had been resting her head on Bryn's shoulder just before we went into the restaurant, but was just an absolute pleasure to have at the table with us. She had Bryn and me switch seats halfway through dinner, and gave me lots of hugs and kisses in between the drawings that kept her busy. She also gave me a "Snow White" kiss and we showed it to her Daddy for the first time. This was Mirei's idea yesterday and it makes me laugh. She knows we don't kiss children on the lips in our family, but she just started yesterday on giving me a "Snow White" kiss, which means a very light tender little kiss on my mouth. </p>
<p>Bryn wanted me to catch up on my two blog entries, so volunteered to get Mirei ready for bed and tucked in tonight. And of course, once again I asked her what she should do if she woke up and found herself alone. This time (yes!), the answer was "roll over and go back to sleep.", and then in a quieter voice she said "and cry." She knew this would make us laugh, though, and in fact she hasn't called out for the past week or so. Not to anyone's surprise she was asleep very quickly, just past 7:30.</p>
<p>Bryn and Doug went off to a movie at 8 P.M. and I got busy writing three posts and adding the photos that Doug had done for me today. </p>
<p>Had a nice chat with Kelly during the evening, too, so that was a plus. I should go off to bed soon and get another good night's sleep under my belt. I know I will accomplish more tomorrow if I just do it! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/breakfast_out_half_moon_bay_an.html">Breakfast Out, Half Moon Bay, and Four Pumpkins</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn and Mirei both woke at 7 this morning, not long after I did. They had a breakfast date with Sean and Gen' at "Just for You" this morning at 8:15, followed by a day in Half Moon Bay at the pumpkin patch for Mirei with Sean and Gen'. So the hour we had together flew by. Bryn sat at the table with Mirei, cutting out her name in big pink letters so she could glue them onto a paper she had and I had stained pink using the bougainvillea blossoms she found last night. She ate a big bowl of oatmeal, with banana and blueberries and nuts in it, and I packed up a lunch and snack bag for her just before they left, waving goodbye from the car window, and Mirei blowing double-handed kisses to me too. </p>
<p>Doug was being interviewed by Gregg for a pod feed today, part of a travel convention that is going on in Toronto, and while that was going on, Caillie called to chat. She had been to the convention earlier in the day but was very anxious to find out the name of a magazine full of Hallowe'en costumes that Riku had with him here in August. </p>
<p>Mirei wasn't back until after 2:30, and I made good use of those hours, finally finishing up all the paper work from the kitchen counter, and getting all sorts of little jobs done. I also wrote dozens of emails, catching up there a bit too. But of course the time flew and what fun to have Mirei come racing up the steps with four small pumpkins gathered in her arms, telling me they were all for me! (Later, Doug told me that she had told <strong>him</strong> that one was for Daddy, one for Grandpa, one for me, and one for her.)</p>
<p>Sean and Gen' obviously were just great with her, as over the next few hours we heard all about all the things she had done: fed the goats, bounced in the bouncy castle four times, taken the train ride, and had ice cream too, as well as all of the food I had packed for her. </p>
<p>She was hot so we got her cooled down with a cool facecloth, and took off the tights she had been wearing with her skirt, and then she donned an apron and we started making a carrot cake. I had told her this morning we needed to do some baking as the date squares were almost finished. Mirei finished off the last tiny piece as a snack (I'm so glad she likes them!) after she got home, along with some grapes and cucumber slices. </p>
<p>Mirei loves to help in the kitchen, of course, and today did a great job pulling the egg apart once she had cracked the shell. She even held the pieces way up in the air and looked ever so professional doing so! So she did the usual scooping, measuring, pouring, turning the mixer bowl, adding and sniffing, and insisting on helping me carry it to the oven too. We will ice it tomorrow. </p>
<p>Mirei did her letters with Doug and it was fun to just listen to the two of them as they worked together. She also had a little time with Grandpa on the computer after we had finished mixing up the cake batter. She came back to me in time to smooth the batter and drink some of the pineapple juice left over after straining the pineapple we add to it. </p>
<p>Then she and Doug went up to watch "Horton Hears a Who" while I prepared macaroni and cheese for dinner and did the cleaning up. I had it in the oven and was delighted when Bryn contacted Akane in Japan, and I had a chance to talk to Riku on the phone. </p>
<p>It's a rare event for many reasons, but it's Sunday there today and so he, his mom, and Akane's cousin were all there, but ready to leave the house soon. Unfortunately the connection was really poor, and Riku and I spent a lot of time saying "Pardon?", but he told me about a dream, and about a frog that almost got hit by a car, and that he was coming to San Francisco again next summer. I was able to tell him that I would be in Japan with Grandpa too, not long after Bryn and Mirei get home. </p>
<p>Mirei was a very tired girl and cried when Bryn brought her downstairs for dinner at 5:30. Doug had put in a second video for her and of course she wanted to sit there and watch it.. I'm sure she would have fallen asleep in just a few minutes, and I was sorry I spent so much time making dinner. I would have put on a short Caillou for her instead, and had her in the tub before dinner. We'll keep to the usual routine from now on of videos in the mornings, as Mirei has such active days that the TV just makes her sleepier still. I know the feeling well! </p>
<p>Her little upset didn't last too much longer and soon she was her usual smiling self, being silly, and interacting with all of us. She ate a good-sized dinner with lots of sautéed spinach on the side. </p>
<p>We showed her Daddy how we were doing left hand, right hand maneuvers yesterday on the steps outside: left arm over right arm, left hand touching right ear, right foot over left leg, etc. It was lots of fun and of course Bryn had her putting her right arm behind her head to touch her left ear. Once Bryn and Doug left the table, she and I did a new song for her. Actually, she had heard it before, but told me "I don't remember that song" and so we went over "Tommy Thumb ... " three times and she had the gist of it pretty quickly. We did the number flash cards too, and Mirei continues to practice holding up her fingers to figure out some of the sums. </p>
<p>Doug and Bryn went off on BART tonight to a concert together, leaving the house at 7 P.M. Mirei was out of the tub shortly after that, and tucked into bed with two stories tonight, "Goodnight Moon" and "The Very Quiet Cricket", both of which she enjoyed very much. Mirei has lots of questions now about letters and what words they make up, so we talked about go, and good and goodnight all being in the same word. </p>
<p>I am going to do a second entry for today, as I want to put the photos of Mirei baking the carrot cake up as well, so that will follow.I am going to end with some Mirei quotes, as she is expressing herself so very clearly these days, and learning new words or coming out with new expressions every single day. </p>
<p>"I wish you could have come too." ... meaning the pumpkin patch excursion</p>
<p>"It was a very busy day today and I am tired." ... said after giving up on the trike ride outside with Doug. </p>
<p>"I wanted to drink some water 'cause it was hot walking around today at the pumpkin patch." </p>
<p>"I had a <strong>good</strong> time at the pumpkin patch." </p>
<p>... and, after doing the letter P with Doug ... "That is an excellent P."  (if she did say so herself!)</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/mirei_and_i_make_a_carrot_cake.html">Mirei and I Make a Carrot Cake</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei was ready to settle in at home after her fun, busy day out with Sean and Gen' at the pumpkin patch. We were down to the last tiny date square that we baked last week, which Mirei finished for her snack, so it was time to get baking. So, with hands washed and her apron on, Mirei lifted the kitchen chair over to the counter and we got started. </p>
<p>Today Mirei figured out how to get her thumbs in each side of the egg, and pull it apart with less mess, and we were both delighted with this new skill! "I did it, I did it, all by myself!" </p>
<p>The photos tell it all (although there are more photos not included in this posting). </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/cool_foggy_day_and_two_playgro.html">Cool, Foggy Day, and Two Playgrounds</a></h2>
								<p>Doug drove Bryn to the airport this morning about 6:40 or so. I heard a door shut, but Mirei was still sleeping soundly and I drifted back to sleep with her until 7:15. Bryn left us a note saying goodbye as we hadn't done so before he and Doug left for the concert last night. Mirei was very pleased to see her name and "Daddy" too, as she could read them herself, and took notice of the hugs and kisses too. </p>
<p>She made me laugh this morning, sitting at the table nibbling away on her requested breakfast "round bread with a hole in it and cheese please." Yup, a bagel with cream cheese coming up, and cut into quarters as requested. That, and the comics, kept her occupied for a full half hour, keeping Grandpa company. </p>
<p>After breakfast, Mirei got out two lots of Play-Doh and we decided we would make a pie and cookies for a party. We both rolled and patted and decorated, and made a wonderful tiny facsimile of a pie, with bottom crust, filled with tiny "cherries", a top crust with slashes added to that, and then Mirei trimmed the edges with a knife. Then I showed her how to crimp the dough and decided, after seeing how much she enjoyed it, that we really must make a cherry pie before she leaves. She could then make some tiny overworked jam tarts, just as I did as a little girl with my grandmother, and eat them all up! </p>
<p>Of course we sang the two baking songs we know as we worked ... "Can you bake a cherry pie, Billy Boy, Billy Boy?" was our first one, followed by "Five currant buns in a baker's shop." I must try to record her singing her few current songs as, like Riku, she sure does love to sing. Once in a while I will sing a particular one, and Mirei pipes up with "Oh! I bemember that one!" </p>
<p>Our intention was to go to Stow Lake today, but the day went from somewhat overcast to downright cloudy, and the temperature seemed to be dropping too. The power went off twice, and stayed off for quite a long time the second time. Mirei was quite intrigued with this, and didn't quite believe that the TV didn't work and she really couldn't watch "The Grinch". She sat upstairs reading while I showered, and then when I finished asked me to see if the lights were working. I was sure they wouldn't be, but she was right, and told me so, and we watched the rest of the movie she had started last night. </p>
<p>After lunch, knowing we had to get out before the weather got worse, she and I went off to a playground we don't often go to, down below the hill where we live. Mirei had actually requested that we go to "the playground with the moving steps", demonstrating with much hip waggling and feet shuffling just exactly what she meant. My intention was to go there, but we ended up going to two different ones instead. There were a few children at the first one, and Mirei generously shared her sand toys with two younger boys, both of whom were thrilled with the two trucks we still carry with us. We sat and had a little picnic snack there, but it was getting really cold and I was ready to leave after about an hour and a quarter. </p>
<p>We stopped in at a Whole Foods market at the bottom of our hill, specifically to buy broccoli spears, something our usual supplier hasn't had in lately, but Mirei spotted some avocados, so we bought 5 on sale for $5, and some tomatoes ("I don't like tomatoes, I only like tomato sauce on pizza and pasta"), and a special treat of a cookie with ice cream bar. </p>
<p>We were going to be passing our regular playground on the way home, and even though it looked as though it might rain at any moment, Mirei said she would like to stop and play for a little bit. There were quite a few children there, too, and at one point Mirei was sitting in the sandbox with two children, again younger than she. After a half hour, a few rain drops fell, and we came home. I don't think it ever did rain any more than that, though. </p>
<p>We immediately washed up and got our aprons on and made icing for the carrot cake. Mirei was right there helping me, mixing the butter and cream cheese together, tasting it, adding the icing sugar, tasting it, and finally adding the vanilla, and turning the bowl, ending with licking the spatula. She helped me spread the icing on the cake, too, and had another little lick at the end. </p>
<p>And then it was time for doing her alphabet, with Doug again, while I had a quick and hot cup of tea in the living room. This is something else I must tape, as it's quite cute to hear the two of them go through the letters and comment on them too.  </p>
<p>A nice long tub time followed, and then dinner at 5:40. I served Mirei some baked fish nuggets, which we also bought today, along with mashed sweet potato, and steamed broccoli. Mirei's comment? "This looks like a Japanese dinner." We had more set meals like this when she first arrived, but lately I have been serving more casserole-style dishes, such as homemade mac' and cheese, "hamburger" stew, Mexican casserole, potato omelette, and ravioli, always with the veggies on a side plate. Interesting how she notices these little things. </p>
<p>She is picking up on lots of my speech mannerisms and I'm sure Bryn is going to be very aware of them once they get home again. I laugh when I hear her saying, when she can't find her wallet, for instance — she loses it constantly(!) — "That's strange." I usually say "weird", actually, but knowing it bugs Bryn have been trying to use a different word. And of course he's right, it's never weird or strange that something has gone missing, but is where we last put it, but it feels so much better to think that the universe at large is somehow involved. </p>
<p>Mirei chose two books tonight from the bookcase in the living room. She took her time choosing, and then approached me with them saying "Oh, I never read these books before!" I'm sure she has but so long ago she has forgotten. I sent so many books to Japan with them when they moved, but there are still enough there to keep the children happy. Finn and I often sit and ready together too, so it makes sense not to give them all away. </p>
<p>Susan, Kevin, and the children arrived home tonight from Vancouver; Doug picked them up at 6:30. I am sorry they are coming home to such cold weather, as we had a few beautiful sunny days and of course a huge rainstorm too, but perhaps the weather will change. I'm still looking forward to a few beach days! </p>
<p>Off I go to bed. Finn may be visiting tomorrow morning, and I have a few things to do before he arrives.</p>
<p>p.s. Akane sent out a photo of Riku taken on this day, and I just had to add it to this entry too. Such a lovely photo of our too-far-away boy. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/a_visit_with_finn_and_a_new_pl.html">A Visit with Finn and a New Play Spot for Mirei</a></h2>
								<p>I sure am going to miss being hugged and kissed in the mornings once Mirei leaves! She just wraps those arms around my neck, burrows in, and smiles away at me, as if I am the best thing since sliced bread. Being a Nana is certainly one of my favourite things in the world! </p>
<p>Mirei knows that I am her grandmother, but that I am called Nana. She knows too that she is my granddaughter, as she told me that today. But she didn't know that Akane's mother is also her grandmother. So we got that all straightened out. We've been having lots of discussions about my sisters, and her cousins, and how we all fit together. She's good at remembering, but she will forget once she goes back home. </p>
<p>We had invited Finn over for the morning with us. I knew Susan would have groceries to get, and Finn and Mirei haven't had much time together, due to their busy and various schedules. What busy bees they were, from the moment Finn arrived! Finn asked if I had Tinker Toys, and I do, so those came out and that last about ten minutes tops. The tub of musical instruments was next, so there were some drums banging, and whistles blowing, and harmonicas humming along, but that too ended almost as soon as it had begun. </p>
<p>Mirei got tubs of Play-Doh out for each of them after that, and they sat at the table for quite a long time, Mirei mostly rolling and making "cookies", and Finn wrapping the dough around his index finger. He took it off too quickly each time for me to get a photo of it, but it was pretty funny, that long green finger! He liked it a lot, and so did we.</p>
<p>Finn likes emptying baskets, so that was next on the agenda. He's been through the basket in the kitchen many times, and nothing holds his attention for long, so we all sang the clean up song and that was that, over and done with! </p>
<p>Out came the babies! I have about six dolls in a cradle and a doll stroller in the kitchen, so Finn was the designated "daddy", and Mirei the "mommy" and off they went, Finn with the stroller with two babies in it, and Mirei cradling one little doll, following him. Finn loves the stroller, and walked those babies many times around the kitchen, up and down the hallway and through the living room and dining room. Mirei asked for blankets for all of their babies, and that took a few minutes to get them wrapped and settled in again. Mirei was just asking for the stroller, with Finn none too happy about changing over to carrying the babies in his arms, so snack time came in very handy right then! They were both happy to sit and eat cheese and grapes, and drink apple juice together. </p>
<p>Susan came in at that point, much earlier than I had expected, as I had just put some tiny ravioli on for a slightly early lunch. Finn was tired, and I was sure Susan would want him sleeping ASAP , and that's easier on a full tummy. Susan put the kettle on, the children had some of the ravioli, and puttered around until it was time to say goodbye at 12:45. </p>
<p>Finn has been asking the last few times he has been here if he can borrow something. And so each time he takes something from my house to his house and always brings it back. Today he borrowed a plane, and walked out with it, looking as pleased as punch. </p>
<p>Susan arrived this morning with a big box of my favourite chocolates in the whole world, from Daniel's in Vancouver, Belgian chocolate extraordinaire! Each one is just pure joy for me, as they were a regular treat when we lived there. And when she arrived to pick up Finn, she came bearing flowers ... the most gorgeous tiny coral roses, over two dozen of them. What a gorgeous bouquet adorns my kitchen counter, the spot where I will see and enjoy them the most often. And there was one other treat too (we are so spoiled!), a container of Belgium chocolate pudding from Trader Joe's, the best chocolate pudding we have ever tasted, and never buy for ourselves. Susan sure does know our soft spots! </p>
<p>Mirei finished off her lunch, and then we headed up to Noe Valley for a hair cut for me. Bing was available and Mirei sat in the chair beside me, telling me I looked funny with all the clips in my hair, and trying to talk me into letting her get her hair cut too "cause, see, it's getting in my eyes." ... pulling hair from the side of her head to try to get it near her eyes! She wandered over to look at the hair styling books later on, just before we left. </p>
<p>It has been threatening to rain all day today and we did have some sprinkles on and off, so we went off to a new-to-Mirei playground/place, the Upper Noe Valley Recreation center. They have an open house from 3–5 each day for children under 5, and there were lots of little ones there when we walked in just after 3. Mirei was quite happy riding each type of vehicle on wheels, including a plastic doll carriage(!), and loved the little roller coaster that Riku got to try in the spring. She spent some time playing on her own with a small doll with huge hair, and at one point she just looked as though she could not figure out what to do with that hairdo! </p>
<p>But she had the best time when a boy about her age came in. They played so well and happily together for the next hour, and both were reluctant to leave when it was time. Mirei told me that maybe she would see him on another rainy day. Apparently we had quite a downpour while we were inside that room, but none of us noticed it. </p>
<p>Home for the usual nighttime routine ... tub first, then dinner, then Mirei's letters. She did some letters this morning too, writing a letter on her own while I wrote to Neal. Just as she was finishing up dinner, Mirei told me she was really tired. I suggested she choose her two books and she came back with two we hadn't read before. One was a "silent" book with no words, a gift for Riku from Auntie Kelly and family, and Mirei enjoyed it so much. She pays attention to detail and so was easily able to tell what was happening. The other was a book of opposites, told with sweet drawings of mice, so that too was a hit. I left her sleeping at 7:20 tonight.</p>
<p>Mirei's language skills are ever-growing and so today I heard her repeat something she said yesterday, patting the place beside her ... "Come and keep me company, Nana." </p>
<p>Later on, I got out a very small bowl of tiny pieces of tortilla chips and we were sharing them. I was busy in the kitchen, clearing up dishes, and Mirei said "Come and sit down and relax Nana, it's nicer to sit when we are sharing." And so it was. </p>
<p>Several times today Mirei would do something and she would tell me that "Daddy always does/says this to me!" and would then proceed to fill me in on how Bryn makes her laugh. She does such a good imitation of her daddy and it's such fun to see how his wonky sense of humour is part of his daughter's personality too now. How she loves to make people laugh! I know how quiet this house is going to be when she leaves to get on that plane for Japan.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/a_windy_hour_at_a_beach_and_su.html">A Windy Hour at a Beach and Sunshine in Potrero Hill</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei slept her usual eleven and a half hours again tonight; she never complains about going to bed, and I think the time we spend outside running around is a big part of this. It sure works for me! I was up too late last night reading, so will be in bed earlier tonight for sure. Mirei kept suggesting we snuggle this morning and would lie quietly beside me, not even talking. It was a lovely quiet waking this morning for both of us, and I guess she was ready for it too. </p>
<p>This morning at breakfast Mirei suggested that she do her "homework" and so printing out her alphabet was over with very early today. She watched a couple of Pingu episodes while I showered, but then we came right downstairs as we had work to do. The little desk in the kitchen that the children use has been getting messier and messier as Mirei explored every box and container, added papers and her books to it, and lots of writing paper too. So together we cleared everything off, sorted it out carefully, so now Riku's box contains only his things once more, and we went through sharpening the pencil crayons too. Mirei helped with it all, and did a very good job sharpening the pencils. Then she helped me test the markers and we tossed the ones that weren't working anymore.</p>
<p>I have wanted to have the numbers up on the white board again, just so that they are visible for Mirei when she is at the table. She likes to either be the teacher or have me take that role, and having the numbers up again, and the days of the week on the fridge, gave us plenty of teaching moments over the course of the day. Mirei knows her alphabet so well that I didn't bother putting that up again, but we did decide to hang the sign on the fridge that tells us what the day was like. Today the word was "sunny." </p>
<p>Based on that, we had plans to go to the beach today. It was a little overcast until after our lunch, but as soon as I packed up snacks for us, we headed over to the other side of the city. By the time we got to the Marina district, the temperature had definitely dropped, but we sat on a long stretch of beach, with only part of the Golden Gate bridge visible through the fog! I had taken our jackets with us, and a scarf for me, and so we sat, bundled up, making sand cakes and castles. I had forgotten my camera, which was such a shame as there were certainly some "Kodak moments" as Mirei happily dug in the sand, oblivious to the wind. She even told me "I don't mind the wind, do you Nana?" I didn't mind it for an hour but then it started to blow and it wasn't fun any longer. Mirei was fine with changing to a warmer spot, and so we headed over to our side of town again.</p>
<p>I had a tape of children's songs in the player, and Mirei heard "This Old Man ..." for the first time, I think. We sang it over and over, and will have another addition to her list of new songs learned or relearned on this trip. As well as the original versions, Mirei has become very fond of making up her own words to the same tunes, sometimes with a similar theme, but not always. Sometimes it is <strong>not</strong> five little ducks out on a walk, but four goats eating some food. She is very inventive but most of this singing happens in the car, where I can't record it. One day I will get a bit of these little gems on video. </p>
<p>Mirei has very strong opinions about songs she hears, and today told me three times "I don't like that song." If they don't have a verse that repeats so that she can join in, I think that eliminates it from her playlist. Some of the songs are very complicated and I haven't learned them after hearing them played over and over again. Riku is happy to listen to the words and enjoy that aspect of them, but not Mirei. She is interactive! </p>
<p>I let Mirei choose the sunny playground and of course she chose the one with the "swinging steps" again! It was incredibly warm and we went from jackets to just a light sweater for Mirei and to just my blouse and no scarf for me. What an interesting place this is. We stayed there for about an hour, and had to park at the Safeway store a long block and a half away. Now Mirei knows what a block is. There were lots of children there today, mostly younger ones with their nannies, and so Mirei had lots of children to observe at play, one of her favourite things to do. She continues to practice climbing <strong>up</strong> the slides although is very careful when the little ones are using the same one. </p>
<p>And of course we had our usual nighttime routine ... bath as soon as we came in, followed by dinner, with me reading to Mirei during dinner, and time for some colouring after dinner. At one point Mirei joined two of the pencils together and pretended it was a magic wand; I crowned her a princess, and then she did me the same honour. Taking care of a child could not be easier than with this happy little girl. She is just so reasonable, and so makes it easy to just enjoy every minute with her, literally. I told a friend today that having Mirei around is like having a small companion, as it just doesn't feel like "babysitting." </p>
<p>Mirei often chooses not to have dessert here, although I think she almost always does at home. I always offer it to her... fruit, or custard, or strawberry ice cream and although Riku would almost always choose fruit, Mirei more often than not says "No thank you, Nana. I am full." and that is that. But tonight she opted for the Devon custard I try to keep on hand for the children, and some strawberries. She had lots of grapes today too, so I am happy to have her eating more fruit that she was when she first arrived. She and Finn went through lots of red grapes yesterday too. </p>
<p>Last night, Mirei chose a sweet story in a mouse series about opposites; she is clear on that concept, and so tonight chose two more in the same series ... numbers, and the alphabet. She really enjoys these books; the illustrations are delightful with lots of humour, so it is fun to read them to her and listen to her reactions to what the mice are doing on each page. </p>
<p>Tonight Mirei was talking about cousins and aunts and uncles and remembered that she had gone to Auntie Gail's and Uncle Tom's house "one day". She is trying to sort out yesterday and tomorrow and this morning asked about morning, afternoon, and evening. There is so much to learn and she's keeping on top of it all. She even knows about step-mothers and step-brothers and sisters now, and reminded me that not every stepmother is a mean one. </p>
<p>Mirei was fast asleep at 7:20 tonight and I am heading off to bed early myself. We are hoping to be off to the Bay Area Discovery Museum in the morning, if the rain holds off for us. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/bay_area_discovery_museum_day_1.html">Another Bay Area Discovery Museum Day</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei slept for twelve solid hours last night, which meant that I got seven and a half hours' sleep despite turning out my light at midnight. As usual, Mirei woke up bright and happy, and wanted to just stay in bed talking and hiding and pretending we were going to stay in there all day. We would have breakfast, lunch, and dinner there, invite in some zoo animals — but not the elephants — and have snacks, and read lots of books, and then it got silly with deciding to go to the bathroom there too. That's our girl! </p>
<p>To our delight, it wasn't raining at all, and in fact Grandpa told us it was going to be a sunny day. We headed for the BADM at 10:15, and met up with Susan and Finn at 11 A.M. They had already done the tots' area, so we just meandered around the playground as usual, with time in the boat, and in the gravel pit, and Mirei's current favourite, the "cave", with lots of sea treasures stuck in its walls. Mirei spent quite a bit of time in the huge hollowed out tree today, and so I got a few photos in that spot. It's usually pretty busy and so hard to do this, but I even got Finn in a photo with her too. He was busy in other areas, and Mirei didn't show any interest in either the twig house or climbing the hill to ring the bell today. We'll be back, though. </p>
<p>We joined Susan and Finn for lunch indoors, though, and they headed off not much longer after that for Finn's nap in the car. Mirei was very keen to get to the arts and crafts room, and the clay and paint room, so most of the rest of our time was spent there. She loved the new clay, although it doesn't hold together as well as the usual mix, but it didn't matter to her at all. It wasn't busy in that area at all, or even throughout most of the outdoor area once a huge school group left, so there was lots of time and space today. </p>
<p>There was a découpage area set up next door in the craft room that was finishing up soon, so she was talked into going and trying that out. Of course she loved it, and worked diligently at pasting scraps of coloured paper onto a big box. I knew she would like it, and wrote down the recipe for the gluey paint they used. </p>
<p>There was to be a special "class" today at 2:15 to learn how to make GAK, a white glue, water, liquid paint, and borax soap mixture, and quite a nice crowd of little ones gathered for that. While they were waiting for it to start, many of the children, including Mirei, were stacking big empty, decorated boxes into piles and then crashing down into them. Lots of fun there! </p>
<p>And the came the demonstration. The fellow who was heading it up was just great, and all the children took turns at one aspect of the process or another: pouring the glue, pouring the water, adding the Borax, and then, best of all, mixing it all up. Some children didn't like getting the goop on their hands at all, but Mirei joined in with the other enthusiasts and had a grand ol' time. We came home with a nice sized piece of the pale orange and the special pink piece they had used to show us how it felt before they mixed up the other. This was a great success! </p>
<p>Mirei stopped to do a little chalk work on the way out, and had a fifteen-minute visit with one of the staff while drawing some pictures. The two of them were working at that for about ten minutes while I chatted with a parent about children's names, and then once I joined them, Mirei drew a sailboat complete with sails, clouds, and rain. She chatted with so many people today, always telling them her name, how old she is, how old she will be soon, and that she had a mother and a brother, who was six, and a daddy too. Her mommy's name is Mommy and her daddy's name is Daddy and her brother's name is Riku and it is spelled R I K and U. She is a people person for sure! </p>
<p>We left there later than ever before, at 3:30, but not before stopping to spin three pennies into the always-favourite collection spinner. Today she figured out to really make it last and stop it with her hand, so those three pennies were worth ten minutes of entertainment! Because it was so quiet there today, there wasn't the usual line up of children wanting to be next. </p>
<p>I was sure Mirei would fall asleep on the way home. But I had the children's tape playing, and we were singing along to that; she had some snacks and her water bottle to keep her busy as well, and she was just great. </p>
<p>Grandpa hadn't yet left for his dinner meeting tonight, and so I sat on the sofa with the paper for ten minutes while they sat at the table and played with the GAK, switching colours now and then. Mirei likes to "switch", and after Grandpa left we sat and played for a bit too. </p>
<p>It was tub time then, and Mirei asked me to sit with her in the bathroom. I told her I would have to get dinner started soon to which she replied "Nana, just sit down and relax, and keep me company, okay? Just for a little while. It's nice to relax and your back will feel better." Actually, my back has been behaving quite nicely since a few days after my acupuncture treatment, but I was happy to sit and watch her play with all the plastic animals. I have only eight more days with Mirei, and it's surprising how often she tells me that she is sad and that she will miss me, but she is sorry 'cause she has to see her mommy and her brother too in Japan, but that I will come and visit her 'cause Daddy told her that, but she is sad 'cause Grandpa is not going to come and visit her, and she thought he was going to but he changed his mind. </p>
<p>I really wish I could get one of these long conversations on tape, but I can just see the rolling of the eyes, and the antics that would appear once that camera got turned on! </p>
<p>Tonight, at dinner, Mirei asked a lot of questions about my parents, and she asked to see a picture of my daddy. And soon there was a photo of both mom and dad on the table, and Mirei had quite a little conversation with me about how she was sad that my mommy couldn't hold her and sing to her (I had told her today that if my mom were alive that she would do both these things, and even sang a song I knew my mom would have sung to her: "Here we go gathering nuts in May, nuts in May ... "). She taught it to Kelly's Brynnie when he was a little boy and no doubt to my children as well.</p>
<p>And of course she went on with how she was sad that my daddy couldn't hold her hand, and we talked about how my mom didn't like his beard so much, etc. etc. And we talked about all her cousins and aunts and uncles, and named as many of them as we could, as she put dots on a paper to represent them. We're busy around here! There is a lot of information going into that little head of Mirei's, but I don't know how much she will remember once she leaves the source of it all. </p>
<p>She has been talking quite often about my dying and even though I have reassured her that it wouldn't be for a long long time (I think I'm supposed to say "God willing" here!), it still comes up almost every day. </p>
<p>The other topic of conversation is about how many babies she will have, and about wombs and maybe she won't have a baby 'cause it hurts when it comes out. Riku is glad that he won't be having a baby so I guess the word is out that it's painful. </p>
<p>Bryn came home (from his trip to Vancouver) just as we were finishing up dinner, and Mirei went running down the stairs as fast as she could to jump into his arms the minute she opened the door! Talk about being well greeted! She got to show him the GAK too, and have some time playing with it with him, as well as chatting away about a dozen things that came to her mind. She was disappointed that he was going out, but it was bedtime anyway, and she blew kisses and waved goodbye from the window, put her two books for story time in her room and met me in the bathroom for her bedtime routine. Mirei was asleep at 7:40 tonight, and asked what our plans were for tomorrow before settling down. I think we might head out to San Jose to another children's museum as our time together is coming to a close, and there are still so many things to do!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/san_jose_discovery_museum.html">San Jose Discovery Museum</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei woke just before 7 A.M. today and after stretching, and stretching some more, she asked if it today was the day for the "new Discovery Museum?" and it is indeed. And the next thing on her mind was the GAK we came home with yesterday. There wasn't a lot of snuggling today, as she was anxious to get at it. The minute her morning routine was done... bathroom, dressed, hand wash, teeth, face and hair, she was sitting at the table happily rolling away. I sat with her over breakfast and we stretched it and braided it, and made bread dough and marked it, all to her delight. </p>
<p>This morning she went up to Doug on the computer and said to him "Show me something interesting." and up she crawled onto his lap. So cute! They were looking at random photos, not family photos, and Mirei was determined that I see all the beautiful sunsets, mountains, and bridges too! </p>
<p>We got going out to the valley later than I hoped we would, but Mirei had done her letters, and asked if she could watch "the pirate Caillou story" while I showered. She also asked if I would sit and watch Caillou with her after I showered, and so we watched an extra one together. </p>
<p>Mirei and I read four of the five books she chose for the car ride on the way down south, and then she looked at them all again as I read a bit more in my own book. One of the books mentioned currant buns, which meant we had to stop and sing our latest newest song together. </p>
<p>We stopped for lunch at a Mexican spot "Wahoo's", one of Doug's favourite valley eateries, and Mirei enjoyed her plain quesadilla very much. We stopped in Sunnyvale on an errand for Doug, and Mirei was by this time anxious to get to the museum! </p>
<p>We spent two and a half hours there and how she loved it all. The water play area was not quite as good as I remembered it from when I took Riku there, many years ago, but Mirei was happy to do some experimenting with Doug, tossing balls into the top of a tall vortex tube, and delighted when she found a smaller one that she could manage herself. There were bubbles to make, and pumpkins to weigh, a boat to row, "pushing pins" to make handprints (and faceprints if one is with Grandpa), balls to push up pressure poles, a big firetruck to sit in, gears to spin, a stage coach to ride in, and so much more, and that was all on the first floor. </p>
<p>While I had a cup of tea, Doug and Mirei wandered upstairs and I don't remember this from the last time at all. I found Mirei making Doug "pizza" in a very large "restaurant", complete with menus, a red glowing oven, lots of veggies to place on the pizza, big wooden paddles for pushing the pizza into the oven, and removing it when cooked, and tables to serve it on, complete with plates and utensils, and even a pitcher of water. Mirei loaded ours up with more vegetables; she knows how many veggies we should be taking in every day! </p>
<p>There was a grocery store on the side of this room too, with baskets and string bags, and bins filled to the brim with lots of produce. Mirei could have stayed in there for the entire hour left to us, but we managed to move her on to the other interesting spots. </p>
<p>Of course every area was just such fun for her... a small room complete with "dough" for rolling and mixing up into cookies and buns, was a hit. And she loved the tiny living room, with a table set with tea items, and babies to tend to as well. Perhaps the biggest hit in that room though was the multi-mirrored section, where not one Mirei smiled out at herself, but six or eight! Doug knew that would be a hit and it was! </p>
<p>There was so much to do, but we made a good run at doing all the things that were fun for her, ending with face painting, which I remembered so well doing with Riku and Amelia when they were a little younger than Mirei is now. Mirei likes lots of paint on her face, unlike Riku, although she did find it a little itchy on the way home. </p>
<p>We read our last book, ate lots of snacks (pistachios, an orange cream yogurt, a current favourite which Doug stocked up for her, and some grapes.), and then entertained each other by drawing on one single piece of paper all the way home. We took turns. Mirei made me a picture, and wrote my name, then I drew her a picture, and she drew a cat, and I drew a cat, and so it went almost the entire way home. I was so sure it would be difficult to keep her awake, but we had lots of fun and sang songs, and chatted away, that there just wasn't a chance for her to sleep. </p>
<p>Much to her delight, Bryn was here when we arrived and she crawled into the bed he was working on, to giggle away with him and tell him about her day. </p>
<p>Tub time, dinner time, and a first chat with Uncle Frank who called to say he has his phone in his room at last. Uncle Frank was surprised to hear Mirei's deep strong voice, as he was expecting to hear a tiny little girl's voice. Instead he heard "Hello Uncle Frank. How are you? I am fine.  (and in an aside to me she whispered "he should say "good", right Nana?") as she had told him she was fine too! I don't think he heard that part of it. Mirei sees Uncle Frank on the computer slideshow so knows his name and hears me speak of him. He is often included in our tea parties or dinner parties, as well as many of her cousins and aunts and uncles. When she said goodbye, and I had a turn on the phone, he told me her "I love you. Good night." was the sweetest thing he had heard all day. </p>
<p>Mirei was tucked in with <strong>three</strong> stories tonight! Her dad had whispered to her when he left for dinner out that she should ask me for the extra one. She chose carefully though, and two of the stories were not long ones. </p>
<p>I just remembered something Mirei said to me yesterday that made me laugh out loud. I had said something to her using a "baby" voice and she said very sternly to me "Talk properly, Nana. Daddy doesn't like to listen to that kind of voice." </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/a_very_quiet_day_at_home.html">A Very Quiet Day at Home</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei went happily off to Little Angels with her dad this morning, at 8:30, after a relaxed hour and a half at home. There was time to snuggle in bed, talk about her day, eat breakfast, and do her alphabet too. When I asked how the drop off had gone Bryn replied, "Just fine; she's taking on the world, one day at a time." Indeed! </p>
<p>Mirei had an invitation for a playground playdate after school with her old classmate Jonah, now a kindergartener, and his sister Sophie, who is Riku's age. The family had visited in Japan for just one day during the summer, but even without much contact with them, Mirei was fine being picked up at 3 P.M. by the dad. She had voiced some trepidation yesterday afternoon, and told me she wanted me to come too, but there wasn't any hesitation at all when it all took place. We weren't surprised, although I wondered how tired she would be after such a busy day. </p>
<p>I stayed home today, and plowed through lots of work around the kitchen mostly, cleaning, purging, sorting, making a couple of important phone calls, and getting things ready to mail. I did the laundry too, and a little tidying up in that room as well. Emails were written, and a huge number of photos from yesterday gone through. I expected to accomplish more than I did, but am still pleased with what I did do. </p>
<p>Caillie had a fever of 103ºF yesterday, and so was home today from school. I called her about 2 o'clock her time and we had a nice long talk. She has decided on a Hallowe'en costume, a "goth" ballerina, I believe, and she filled me in on what has been going on in her life. Caillie has been looking at the photos of Mirei on Facebook and so wishes she were here to play with her, and spend time with her. One day, perhaps ... </p>
<p>At 4:30, Doug and I met Sophie's and Jonah's dad at the big playground in Golden Gate park. We hadn't been there this trip, although mostly, I was told, Mirei played in the sand box with Sophie, which is where they were when we met up with them, but apparently she had played with Jonah for a little bit at first. We said goodbye fairly quickly with perhaps ten minutes letting Mirei finish up with Sophie, and then we got them together for a group shot. </p>
<p>Mirei had a good day, she told us, but it turned out she hadn't eaten much at all. I gave her a snack of her uneaten grapes and strawberries, which she wolfed down, and then fed her pistachios after that. She went right into the tub while I made homemade mac' and cheese from scratch on the stove top, and added some leftover sweet potato mash into it. It made it a lovely golden yellow colour, and gave Mirei an extra vegetable too, one she said she didn't like the other night. My guess is that it was the texture, but it smoothed out beautifully in the cheese sauce. Lots of broccoli and corn, and playing with some letters and numbers halfway through dinner had our cheerful girl back. She said she was playing "creep along" at school and that was why she didn't eat her lunch. Hmm-m-m. Unusual for her not to eat well. </p>
<p>Mirei chose three books tonight, two of them very short, very easy ones, and one was a Shel Silverstein book, called "The Giving Tree", a book that generated lots of questions and puzzled looks from Mirei. She wondered why that boy didn't want to visit the tree anymore, etc., etc. </p>
<p>That's it for today ... and so very few photos of Mirei for this entry! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/another_quiet_day_at_home.html">Another Quiet Day at Home</a></h2>
								<p>A couple of weeks ago Bryn bought tickets to "Disney on Ice"; he and Mari thought it would be fun for Mirei and were they right! I don't think Mirei really knew what skating meant, but she was excited about the idea of seeing princesses, which she knew were part of the show. </p>
<p>She had a lovely long sleep again last night, and after stretching and a long cuddle in bed, the first thing she asked me was whether I was going to see the princesses too. I wasn't, of course, but knew we had to get moving so that she would be all set to leave at 9:30. </p>
<p>I told Mirei she could wear a dress today, since I knew it would be hot in the valley, and she chose her pink one. She looked as sweet as could be in it, and she won't be wearing sleeveless summer dresses for a long time. She and her dad go home in just five days. </p>
<p>The minute she had eaten her egg and toast she asked for a bowl of water, so that she could soak the gel capsule she had found that magically produces an animal. It usually takes a while for this to happen, but Mirei decided she didn't have to wait at all, but could instead just peel off the plastic, and voila! She was delighted to see the cow emerging ever-so-quickly. None of the other children have done this, but patiently waited and watched to see it take place over an hour or more. </p>
<p>I packed her up a snack pack, and off she went with Grandpa—to be dropped off at T'ai Chi—and then on to San Jose for the 11 A.M. show. Doug came home briefly before heading right back out to a movie, so I had the entire day on my own. I expected Bryn and company back about 2, so worked fast and hard at housework and even took some time to work on my family tree, a very rare event these days. Since they didn't arrive back until close to 5 o'clock, I got so much done, and my back let me know it, too. </p>
<p>Mirei came bounding into the house and started telling me about all the princesses she had seen, and described the sparkles on their dresses (short dresses, not long ones), and how one girl cut her long hair "cause she was protecting someone", and there were leaves made from lights on the ice, and there were princes and many many girls, and a fairy godmother. It all sounded very exciting and Bryn said it was just a perfect venue for her: she sat enraptured, paid lots of attention, and told Bryn that "sometimes the Beast (of "Beauty and the Beast") was nice and sometimes cranky." She knows her movies! </p>
<p>She was full of vim and vigour when she got home, and full of beans too. She imitated her dad's voice perfectly when he was on the phone, repeating the tone of voice he used when answering ... "helll lo therrrrre", making us both laugh, and then doing the same thing when he hung up ... "buh bye." And of course making us laugh makes her laugh, and so it goes on and on. What a character Mirei is! </p>
<p>We have a little game in our family, with this current generation of children, whereby they put their feet up on the table and I say in a stern voice, none of which is taken seriously, "Get those feet off my table." It started with Bryn and Caillie, and went on down to Riku and Amelia too. And now it's Mirei's turn, and how she loved hearing it again. </p>
<p>At one point, Mirei asked me what was "important". I was wondering how to define it for her, but she quickly broke in to tell me ... "eating good food is important", and "sleeping is important", followed by "Did you know Nana, that you grow when you are sleeping?" I told her I knew that, and she answered, "I did not know that." And the list went on ... "brushing your teeth is important", "not chewing hard candy is important, 'cause your teeth might break." Later I heard her telling her baby in the tub that she shouldn't eat hard candy and the baby said, "This is chewy hard candy, not (holding her hands in a claw) like this." I'm not sure where all this came from, and Bryn went out before I could ask him about it. </p>
<p>I did some recording of Mirei having a long conversation in the tub tonight. She often goes on for a very long time, most often in Japanese, although over the last week I have noticed she is talking to her babies more in English. And how her English has improved in just this month; I can't believe some of the expressions that she is coming out with these days. Tonight I was taking a peek at the paper, and she told me, "Put down your paper, Nana, and pay attention to me." </p>
<p>Mirei chose four tiny Winnie-the-Pooh books to read over the next four nights, but in fact we read two of them tonight. She had napped on the hour-long trip home, and so I didn't attempt to get her into bed for an hour later than usual, and then it took her forty minutes of lying in the dark to settle down. There was a lot of tossing and turning on her part before those eyes finally closed at 9:10. I was more tired than usual, too: housework is more taxing than playing in the playground! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/a_long_sunny_day_out_in_san_fr.html">A Long Sunny Day in San Francisco</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei woke at 6:30 this morning, when I woke to go to the bathroom. I told her it was too early to wake up, and so she rolled over and went back to sleep until 7:30! She strolled into the kitchen, rubbing her eyes, and I asked her if she wanted me to snuggle with her. She did, and shut the door, saying we could have some "quiet time together". We stayed in bed until after 8, singing and snuggling and talking more about the ice show yesterday. I think Mirei's favourite part was the girl who cut off her hair "to protect her daddy." Bryn had talked to her after the show about why she did that, and it obviously sunk in. </p>
<p>We had a nice lazy morning playing with Play-Doh (we made lots of sliced cookies today and never did get around to the cherry pie she set out to make), and she told her daddy she was "too busy to wave goodbye". Nonetheless, she did run to the window to blow kisses to him (as she always does here), as he walked to a local café to work. </p>
<p>Susan had invited us to join them at a Hallowe'en get-together with Amelia's old Belvedere nursery school group. It was being held in the little playground across the street from their old apartment building, and included pumpkin carving and a puppet show. We arrived before they did, but Nancy Kittle, a family friend of theirs, was there too, so we got to chat for a few minutes before they arrived. I hadn't seen Nancy since January and we caught up during the few hours that we were there. </p>
<p>Kevin was carrying four pumpkins when they arrived and Mirei and I were the lucky recipients of one of them. I cut off the top and scraped it out, but left it to carve at home. There was so much going on ... the pumpkin show was adorable, and held all of the children's attention for most of it. Kevin and Finn were busy carving a pumpkin or two, and Amelia sat with her little one, concentrating on doing it herself. Susan got caught up with lots of old and new friends and acquaintances, and the time passed quickly. There were plenty of goodies to eat too, from pastas to fruit to desserts, and Mirei filled up on mac' and cheese. Later in the afternoon she tried a little Hallowe'en dessert in a cup, and had a few bites before handing it over to me. </p>
<p>Mirei had the best time just running around and playing with whatever children were available. There were many there who were from the older school group, although there were younger siblings there too. She and Kevin had a few minutes together as well; she was pretending she was the captain of a ship and Kevin was a passenger being blown over by the rough seas. Another dad had taken part in this scenario earlier and how Mirei loved entertaining them both. </p>
<p>A little later she came upon another three-year-old girl, and then another, and soon the trio had taken over the slides and were sliding down in unison, arms in the air, and trying out belly and back sliding too. Mirei was happy just sliding down the conventional way for the most part and so enjoyed all that time with the girls. Their moms came over to take photos, too; it was too cute, and they played together for the longest time. </p>
<p>Once the crowd had thinned, and we had said goodbye to Susan and family at 2 o'clock, Mirei wanted to stay and play. There were far fewer children there once the Belvedere group left, but there was a darling little boy, Lars, with his mom, and so the play slowed down to accommodate this little twenty-one-month old. He shared a ball of his with Mirei and she shared her snacks with him. She followed after him, watching out for him, but also held his hand and just walked with him. Lisa, Lars' mom, and I sat and chatted and watched the two of them interact. It was really sweet, and just before we left a second much younger little boy joined us with his dad. Lars shared a second ball with him, although he was too little to really join in. Mirei was so gentle with Lars, and his mom was smitten with her. At one point Mirei pointed out her "big muscles" to the dad, and insisted he feel them, holding out both arms in the classic pec' display. Of course then he had to show her his muscles so that she could feel them! Lisa was next, and even Lars demonstrated his. Quite the crowd pleaser is this girl! </p>
<p>It was after 3:30 when we left the playground, and I didn't want Mirei to sleep on the way home. She was a trouper and sat drawing picture after picture for me, mostly of pumpkins, all the way home, as well as singing along to the children's tape we have heard a dozen times. Mirei's favourite song on the tape is "This Old Man, he plays one ..." but it doesn't come 'round often enough for her. However, we stretched our sillies out and yawned our sleepies out and did well all the way to Rainbow. She had started to droop by that time, but the stop perked her up. She had a cheese sample, and we found the little doll perched in the rafters, and she chose some vanilla sorbet for dessert. One of the mothers, Stephanie (I believe), from Riku's first grade class, was the cashier next to us; she recognized both Mirei and me and stopped to say hello to us. </p>
<p>Mirei got into the tub right away while I prepared a fried rice dish for dinner. She has taken to selecting just a few of the plastic toys to play with, separating the "boys" from the "girls" (based on some colour scheme only she understands). </p>
<p>She ate dinner, with Bryn sitting with her for the last half of it, while I went upstairs for twenty minutes with a cup of tea and a magazine. Bryn had dashed off to a local sports store when we got home with the car, and while I was upstairs Mirei tried on his new shoes. I discovered the photo Doug had taken after she was tucked into bed. And during her playtime before bed, I found her chatting away in the bathroom on one of her play phones, sitting on a small wooden stool, talking first to Auntie Candy, and then Caillie. I snapped a photo, but did some video recording too.  </p>
<p>Mirei was asleep at 7:20 tonight, after two fun stories she had picked out. One is a pop-up book of animals, each being eaten by a bigger and more ferocious one, and she liked it so much we read it twice. Glenna bought this for Kelly's Bryn when he was a little fellow, and it's still in great shape fourteen years later. </p>
<p>Doug and I went upstairs to watch a documentary on oil, and learned how quickly we are really going to run out of it. One of the surprising things I learned is that many of the experts believe that the children of the children now growing up, the Riku's and Amelia's of the world, may never experience air travel, as it will be available only to those who are very wealthy. </p>
<p>I had such a relaxing day, with lots of sitting, and so felt energized enough to tackle the ironing while we watched. It took me two hours and it's done. Nice to have that off my to-do list, as I really believed I wouldn't do it until after Mirei and Bryn leave, in just four more days. Hard to imagine not having this sunny little girl in my days here soon. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/baker_beach.html">Baker Beach</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei and I had talked about going to the beach today, if it was as sunny and warm as it was yesterday. While I was showering I heard on the radio that it was going to be clear and sunny, so we were finally going to have some time at the beach! </p>
<p>I wanted to go once it warmed up, so we had a relaxing morning.We lay in bed for quite a while; she had taken the Raggedy Ann doll to bed last night, the one I made for Kelly about thirty-nine years ago! She asked this morning if she could take Raggedy Ann to Japan, but not with her pants, but just her dress and apron. We left it at "maybe" as I don't want her to get lost in the shuffle of flying there, even though Mirei promised she would take very good care of her. </p>
<p>Last night, Mirei and I read a book about colours and an elephant named Elmer. Mirei noticed the back cover as we finished the book, as it had a tiny drawing of a tree with multiple coloured leaves on it. We decided we would make that the next day, and Mirei remembered this. First she made a cherry pie while eating breakfast, and I promised we would do the art after I showered. She watched a Caillou DVD while I showered, and I watched the end of one episode with her as she does like company so we can talk about what is happening. </p>
<p>So, then came the art project! I drew the leaves on the different colours of paper, and Mirei did all the cutting herself, being very careful with each of them. She did the gluing too, paying careful attention, and stuck them in the same order as the illustration. I drew the little bird for the top of the tree and Mirei glued and placed it. Then  Mirei coloured in the base with a soft pink, which also matched the picture, asking me to finish it, while she drew in a sun and clouds. We were both very pleased with the result! She ran in to present it to her dad, who leaned it against the bookcases in his bedroom, right beside where he works. </p>
<p>And then it was off to the beach! I packed up a snack pack, as Mirei had a full bowl of cereal as a late breakfast filler-upper. It was sunny when we arrived at Baker Beach, and we sat making "cookies" and "cakes" for the longest time. However, the fog started rolling in after we had some snacks and Mirei complained of being cold! This never happens, but she snuggled up against me, and tucked her hands and, at one point, her feet, into my snuggly jacket. She and I both decided we would go to a playground near home as it was hot over on our side of the city. </p>
<p>However, I wanted just a few photos of Mirei near the water, and so we wandered closer to the big waves, and she just loved it. Unfortunately, most of the wonderful shots I took of her jumping and running and finding treasures and staring out at the Pacific Ocean were overexposed. I was so disappointed! We might just have to get back to a beach within the next two days! </p>
<p>It was a good thing that we didn't leave immediately, as I had left a message for Susan telling her where we would be at the beach, in case they wanted to join us, and they did, along with a friend of Amelia's. Finn and Mirei had lots of fun together; Finn played with the trucks and cars from our big bag of toys, and Mirei made more food. Amelia and Sheena went down closer to the waves, further along the beach, and Susan joined them. </p>
<p>A couple had two box turtles out for a run on the beach, so all the children had a chance to see how fast they move, and saw them digging themselves into the wet sand too. Mirei stayed with them for a long time, and touched one turtle that was staying quite still for a bit. </p>
<p>Along with that excitement was a group of five martial arts students, being filmed doing their moves along the edge of the water. The waves were really rolling in, and they must have been cold, but it sure was entertaining watching them go through their paces! </p>
<p>Finn didn't nap today or yesterday, so we all headed home at the same time, about 3:30. Mirei drew more pumpkins for me on the way, and we sang some of our favourite songs, as usual. Today we were back to "Five current buns in a baker's shop ..." and "This Old Man". Mirei was great and didn't doze off for even a minute. </p>
<p>Bryn was home, so she had a little cuddle with him before getting into a very full tub with all her animals. I just had to reheat some pasta for her dinner, and steam some broccoli, so it was on the table for her in just minutes. She was a hungry girl, despite lots of snacks, including a full container of yogurt, at the beach. Mirei wanted to "do Play-Doh" again, and so she ended her day by making cookies and cakes too! We really do have to make a cherry pie, and carve her pumpkin too! </p>
<p>Today we talked about her leaving for home in three days. I have the days of the week posted on the fridge and we have been going over them for a few days now. This morning, as yesterday, we named each day, so that she would know exactly when that was happening. While she was drifting off to sleep tonight, she was quietly naming them all ... Monday through Sunday, all in order, for the very first time since we started this last week. </p>
<p>Mirei is looking forward to going home, but also knows that I will be there "very soon", and also knows that she will be back too "Daddy said that." </p>
<p>She was asleep at 7:30 tonight, and I made a hot cup of tea, sat in the living room, and was really lazy for a half hour or more. Doug had emptied the dishwasher earlier, and Bryn cleaned up the dinner dishes, and I was a very happy woman to find both these jobs done. Laundry and emails awaited me, but I prefer those to a messy kitchen at the end of a fun and busy day. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/no_tot_spot_day.html">No  Visitors or "Tot Spot" Today</a></h2>
								<p>Today was a day of disappointment on two counts, and yet it ended well despite them both. We had been expecting a doula mom over with her under-one-year-old this morning, and since yesterday morning, when I told Mirei about it, she had been looking forward to playing with him. Anticipating their arrival at 10:30, we kept busy in the usual way, with breakfast, Mirei writing her alphabet, a cup of hot chocolate in a pink metal cup, and a few Caillou episodes as we waited. But we waited an hour past the time they were due, and then made a quick decision to go off to Berkeley to a fun indoor play area called "Tot Spot". It was too windy for any outdoor activities this morning, so it seemed perfect, and was on my mental list of places to go with Mirei. </p>
<p>It was close enough to lunch time that we decided to have pizza out, a rare treat for us these days. at our favourite spot in Berkeley: "Zachary's". Mirei kept telling me she didn't want pizza today, so I had packed her up a generous snack, with her favourite yogurt included. I sat with her in the back seat, as we both enjoy singing and chatting and looking outside at anything that catches our eyes, and Mirei had her yogurt on the way there. However, she also had a big slice of pizza cut up in small bites, and enjoyed looking at all the posters on the walls, of pizzas, and reading all the letters out to us from them too. </p>
<p>Doug had a dizzy spell this morning, sitting in front of his computer, and on the way to Berkeley he felt another one coming on. They both lasted just a few minutes, but we pulled the car over and I drove into the city. He is a bit stuffy and felt it was an inner ear problem. He dropped Mirei and I off at Tot Spot, parked the car, and by the time he got back to us, Mirei and I had discovered that they are no longer open during weekday afternoons! We were so disappointed, but we had lots of fun chatting with a young woman who worked there, and was on her way home. She admired Mirei's shoes of choice this morning... one pink with flowers, and one navy blue with cross-over straps. What a funny little girl she is, and she was so pleased that someone noticed too! </p>
<p>We played "I spy with my little eye" all the way home, and Grandpa played with us too. It was still a cool overcast day, but we both needed some fresh air. So, we dropped Doug off at home and went to the playground at the top of the hill. I suggested we go to the one with the moving steps she likes so much, but she said she wanted to go to the closer one. I was surprised, but pleased too, as we didn't have a lot of time before getting home for bath time, etc. There were a few children there, and Mirei was a happy girl running around in the too-cool-for-me air! She even wanted her light jacket off. There was lots of time to climb up the slides, and pretend she was a bear in a cage, as she ran all over and down the play structure. All the grownups were huddling up in their jackets and sweaters, suggesting it was time to leave, and so close to 5 o'clock we too headed home. Brrr! </p>
<p>Mirei had her tub before dinner, and then asked for the Play-Doh. She is really enjoying cutting out "ccokies" and doing a great job at pressing them out clearly and cleanly. She does this by going "wiggle, wiggle, wiggle" with not only the cutter in the dough, but with her whole hip area too. It is just so cute that I found myself asking her to do another "wiggle, wiggle, wiggle" to make sure it was cut properly. Tonight she made so many of the little people I told her they might be my brothers and sisters, and so she made enough that we could name everyone from Uncle Ian down to Uncle Don, the "baby". She knows all about my brothers and sisters, and her cousins and uncles and aunts, and it's fun teaching her how they fit into our family. </p>
<p>Tonight Mirei chose two little books to read, and we snuggled as always for the few minutes it took her to fall asleep. These nights will soon be over... </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/post_10.html">Our Last BADM Day for 2009</a></h2>
								<p>It was a lovely day today, for our final visit to the Bay Area Discovery Museum which, I believe, is Mirei's very favourite place to visit. And so it was the perfect thing to do on this, her last day here for this year. I wonder if she will be too tall by her next visit to go into the tots' area, but I think, and hope, not! </p>
<p>Mirei got to talk to her Auntie Kelly early this morning and she was very excited about this! Kelly was home sick from school with a nasty cough, and called just as Mirei was eating her breakfast. Kelly sang her three Hallowe'en songs, and Mirei knew two of them — "Five Little Pumpkins" and "It's Hallowe'en" — but she claimed she knew a third one too! How funny that she would pretend this, and later in the car we went over it a couple of times. It starts out with "It was a dark dark night, and there was a dark dark house, and in the dark dark house there was a dark dark room ... " It's fun, and is spoken in a low voice, and how I wish I had remembered it to teach to Riku last year. </p>
<p>We had a lazy morning at home, as we spent some time gathering up Mirei's clothes and toys for the trip to Japan tomorrow. Mirei was a willing helper in this, and started off by neatly taking all of her clothes out of the three drawers in her room, and laying them on the bed. Then we went through each room, finding anything that had to go back with her. In the morning, while we were still snuggling, Mirei asked if she could take Raggedy Ann with her on the plane, promising to take good care of her on the trip and at home too. Raggedy belongs to Kelly though, and I didn't feel I should send her off without permission first, but Mirei didn't mention it again during the day and so Raggedy is still here with Raggedy Andy, sitting on the ottoman in the living room, waiting for Mirei to return one day. We had things pretty much in order around here, and so soon had a nice big stack of clothes and toys on the second bed in Bryn's room, waiting for him to pack it all up tomorrow morning. </p>
<p>And then it was off to the Museum for us! We left just before lunch, and as Mirei had eaten a big bowl of porridge not long before that, she asked if we could start off in the room with the "sand". It's interesting, as she doesn't bother much with the supply Susan loaned us many years ago, and yet she will sit and play with it for the longest time at the Discovery Museum. Really I think she likes to have an excuse to sit down with all the other children and watch and listen to them as they play. I talked her into painting with her hands on a piece of paper today, though, so that was fun to see. She patted her hand prints all over a large sheet of paper, and we left it drying on a rack, to pick up later on. </p>
<p>Mirei wore her mismatched shoes again today, just for fun, and I remembered to take a photo of it. You can see her new look in the photo with the sticks. </p>
<p>Following that came our picnic lunch, with Mirei's favourite grilled cheese sandwich and some of the grapes I had taken along for us. Then it was on to the water beds, in the little tots' area, putting on a great spider costume, and watching in dismay as one little boy tried to keep all the stuffed animals to himself. The minute he disappeared for a few minutes, all the other children would race in and grab one or two of them each. Finally, he left, as did most of the other children, and Mirei and another little girl hurried into the "cave" to put the animals to sleep. </p>
<p>Outside at last, Mirei spent a lot of time on the boat today, more than usual, as she got to spend lots of time steering it, and rushing up and down the decks with other children her age. From there it was on to the boat wreck to see if she could find some hidden "treasures" in the sand. She did indeed ... the five pennies, and the one nickel that I buried for her, plus one on the ground and a sixth penny in another spot in the sand. How excited she was and stopped to carefully put them all in her pocket. The garden area was next, and she stopped to "spin" a web and plant the big plastic spider in the centre of it, then went through the twig house. Riku loves to be chased through this fabulous house but Mirei is happy for now to just wander around in it on her own. </p>
<p>There were drums outside today, and the nice young man who always recognizes Mirei came up to say hello, and goodbye, to her once more, as he knows she was due to go home soon. I'm sure they will see each other again. Mirei sat with a little fellow playing with the drums for a while, and then we headed home, after "just <strong>five</strong> more minutes playing at the sand table. </p>
<p>I had hoped we might spot a deer on the way out, up in the hills. We had talked about them on the way in, but Mirei has never seen them, or at least not that she or I remember. And I saw one, grazing with his head down! She was so excited and so I drove to the top of the winding road and turned around, but it was on a curving piece of road on the way back up and I couldn't risk stopping the car long enough to point the animal out to her. One day... </p>
<p>We played "I spy... " on the way home again (Mirei really likes it; she likes to take turns too... such a good sport!), and she had some snacks to eat to keep her awake. It is just the worst time of the day to be in the car, with her alone in the back seat. We left quite late today too, but she did so very well, and we sang too, and kept ourselves busy all the way back home. </p>
<p>While I was preparing dinner tonight I glanced into the living room to find Mirei sitting on the coffee table "reading" a book on her own, with her feet wound around the legs of the table. I realized at that point, for the very first time,  that I never give a thought to Mirei doing something that she shouldn't be; if I am not sure where she is, I will find her either in her room or the living room looking at books, or upstairs in our bedroom, playing with the plastic toys in a big container in the corner, or sitting on our bed with her "babies" or reading. She can often be found in her room too, on the bed, putting the babies to sleep or lying down reading to them. This was true of Riku too; he was almost always looking at books, and I certainly never had to check to see if he was getting into something he shouldn't. I also realized this was true of Kelly and Bryn. Bryn could always be found with his Lego blocks, and Kelly would more often be looking at books or playing with her babies. Interesting to have this come to me today. </p>
<p>After dinner, with tub-time over beforehand, we played with the rubber alphabet letters for a while at the table. Mirei likes to mix them all up, with the numbers too, and then ask me to find the right ones. When I do, she gives me lots of praise, saying "Good job!" before calling out the next one. When we're finished we rush to beat each other at putting in more than the other. </p>
<p>But today Mirei started stacking the letters and this was such fun that she kept at it until she had five or six of the letters carefully balanced, one on top of the other. She even told me that "we have to be careful and choose the letters that are flat." </p>
<p>It was a little more than sad to see Mirei choosing her last books to read tonight. I love watching her in her plaid pink PJs, standing or crouching in front of the bookcases in the living room, carefully going through to find two we haven't read for a while or have never read. The minute her night time routine is over, she hops into bed (after first putting the pillows down so that she can pull the duvet down, crawl in under it, and stack the pillows in exactly the right places. </p>
<p>Mirei is very excited about going home tomorrow; she is so happy she will soon be seeing her mommy and her brother, but she also told me she is sad she is leaving me too. How I will miss her! But, she knows that I am going to be there with her soon too, and so that makes this last night much easier for me, and possibly for her too. I will miss that little arm around my neck, and her quiet little "I love you very much Nana. Good night." </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/bryn_and_mirei_leave_for_japan.html">Bryn and Mirei Leave for Japan</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei has been keeping track of how many days she had left in San Francisco, and so I wasn't surprised when she awoke this morning and told me she was sorry, but that she was going back to Japan today. Their flight was at 11:30, so we had time, thank goodness, for our usual cuddles and giggles in bed. </p>
<p>It was a very quiet and organized last few hours together, as Bryn only had to pack up everything that had been laid out on the bed the night before. He was relieved when I reminded him that he had one more bag to pack in, as I had given him some birthday/Christmas books for the children, and his one big bag was already packed to the brim with the two skateboards he bought here ... one for himself and one for Riku. He was taking back a big block of cheddar cheese too, and a double package of Mirei's favourite pasta here, a cheese stuffed tortellini. That extra bag sure came in handy! </p>
<p>Mirei had time for one of her very favourite activities, making another cherry pie with Play-Doh. She is getting an "A" for crimping, as she handles the fork just perfectly for this job.  While the end of the packing took place, we watched a Caillou DVD together, and she had a big bowl of porridge too. </p>
<p>During the last fifteen minutes I made up a snack pack for Mirei mostly, with an egg and "bacon" omelet, grapes and orange sections, a few treats, and tucked in a new book for her too,  "The Saggy Baggy Elephant". She's a good little traveller and I know it will be a good trip for them both. </p>
<p>Bryn suggested we drop them off at the airport but I wanted to stay with Mirei through the checking-in procedure, and I was glad we did. It all took a while and she and I were able to have some extra time together. We all waved many many times while they went through to the security line, and then one last wave before they disappeared on us. </p>
<p>The house was very very quiet and I immediately started pulling sheets off the beds, and keeping busy. There is so much to do before I leave for Japan in just eleven days, and I sat down and added to the long list of things to do before I am on that plane for eleven hours. The rest of the day flew by for me, but I took time to sit and go through some magazines; they have been stacking up faster than I could read them, and Doug and I watched one of our rented movies that have also been collecting. My mind kept going to that plane, and as the hours went by I wondered what Mirei was doing to keep busy, whether she and her dad were sleeping, and how excited they would be to get home again. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/not_the_day_we_expected_to_hav.html">Not the Day We Expected to Have!</a></h2>
								<p>I checked my email as soon as I came downstairs today and was happy to have one in from Bryn, saying that Mirei got a ten out of ten as a traveling companion, and that they were at the shuttle stop, waiting for their trip home. Later I heard that Mirei slept only one hour of the eleven hour flight, but was a happy and engaged girl all her waking hours. She didn't even sleep on the shuttle on the way home, which really surprised me! </p>
<p>That was good news to start my day as the rest of it was one of those days that makes you realize that you can make plans and then sit back and watch as they all go awry. I had a few clothing items to buy for birthday/Christmas gifts, and wanted to get them bought immediately so that they could be mailed before leaving for Japan. Doug and I had decided to go to the Vacaville outlet mall this morning, have lunch, spend a few hours there and head home mid-afternoon. The trip took longer than usual, as the Bay bridge has been closed down for repairs since Tuesday, so we took the longer "scenic" route, adding perhaps an extra 3/4 hour to the usual fifty minute trip! </p>
<p>Fifteen minutes from Vacaville, Doug felt another of his "spells" coming on, so we pulled over and I drove the last bit to the mall. We decided we would have lunch right away, giving Doug a little time for this to settle down. He was fine for about half an hour, and then he felt another coming on ... but this time it did not leave. In minutes he was very very pale, felt nauseous, and the room was spinning. He didn't eat another bite, didn't want to leave right away, so I got some tea and we sat for perhaps a half hour. We talked about whether it made sense to try to get to a hospital in Vacaville, not sure if there even was one, but decided it made more sense to get back to the SFGH just a few blocks from home, and one of the best trauma hospitals in the States. It's a teaching hospital and we knew there would be good people there to check him out. Two staff members in the restaurant stood on each side of him and guided him to the car. </p>
<p>Doug closed his eyes all the way home, as opening them made him feel woozy, but he was able to tell me just where we were on that trip ... coming to the end of the small main road we took going home, getting on to the 101, on and off the bridge and the exits and on-ramps. It was a little game that kept him occupied and awake. </p>
<p>We drove right to the ER, and staff came out with a wheelchair to get him inside. When I came back after parking the car, he was undressed, on a gurney, and had already started answering questions about why he was there. So much happened after that ... Doug had an EKG, several visits from different doctors, most of them neurologists, had a CT scan done, and when they discovered that there was a self-healed formerly torn carotid artery, they decided to check that out with an MRI. They ruled out a stroke at the back of the head with that test, and were deciding on whether they should go in and redo that carotid artery. </p>
<p>This all took many many hours, as the ER was filled with people lined up in the hallways, where Doug was as well, but his situation was very controlled and not quite so outwardly dramatic as the drunks, the men who had been beaten up or roughed up or had done the roughing up, as well as the woman who signed herself in after trying to commit suicide, and then spent an hour trying to convince every staff member who walked by to give her clothes back to her. They took them after she dressed herself three times, exposing most of her body to whomever happened to be there while she was doing this. </p>
<p>In the middle of the night, things had quieted down enough that we were given a private room. Doug did quite a lot of dozing in between all the medical visitors, but I found it hard to sleep on the hard chair, with no place for my feet, and all the lights blazing. </p>
<p>Doug continued to feel nauseous and light-headed whenever he was asked to stand or move around at all, so the puzzle was yet to be solved as we approached Hallowe'en. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/10/halloween_non-event.html">Hallowe'en Was a Non-Event For Us This Year</a></h2>
								<p>I must be honest and admit that the hours from midnight last night until Doug was released from the hospital about 12:30 P.M. ... 21 hours after he went in, are mostly just a blur. Lots happened, and there were certainly interesting situations going on all around us too, but mostly we just waited while various doctors came and went. Doug's last nurse was a sweet Irish gal and she, along with all the other staff members, was just wonderful. One wonders how they can maintain their cool under such dire circumstances, but except for a little eye-rolling and exchanged glances, they do incredibly well with it all. </p>
<p>I checked to see if the car needed to be moved before 9 A.M. and then went home to wash, brush my teeth, and send out an email to everyone letting them know what was going on here. I also called Susan to let her know that unfortunately we would not be out trick-or-treating with them, as was the plan. I even had our costumes out ready to be ironed, our usual clown outfit for Doug and my witch costume. It's the first year we have missed being out with the children since they were old enough to go, so it was a letdown for sure. </p>
<p>At the end of his time there, Doug was finally assured that they were sure there was nothing to keep him in the hospital. They definitely ruled out stroke and heart-related problems, but want him to see his family doctor next week asap, for a baseline visit, and then a follow up CTA scan in two months on the self-healed carotid artery. </p>
<p>It was a lovely day when the nurse wheeled Doug out to the car. Doug was able to get up all the stairs at the house as there were handholds in all the spots he needed them. It was good to be home, and take a hot shower, but we were both tired out from not sleeping last night. So we had lunch, then I read and fell asleep, went upstairs to watch a taped show and fell asleep again. Doug just pretty well stayed on the sofa for most of the day and ... slept! </p>
<p>He was feeling very disoriented and wasn't able to read, or spend more than a few minutes on the computer. We tried watching a movie, and even had popcorn to eat, but Doug was seeing double so that didn't work either. </p>
<p>We hadn't bought candy to give out as we thought we would be wandering around Belvedere Street, so we turned out all the lights. The door bell didn't ring once and there didn't seem to be any children out on our street at all. No doubt more and more children are going to either private parties, or choosing streets where they don't have to climb 38 steps up to the doorbells! </p>
<p>At 10 o'clock we went up to bed, hoping we would manage to get a few solid hours sleep in a row, despite our too-many naps today! </p>
<p>p.s. The next day, Susan sent a photo of them all dressed up in their wonderful costumes! </p>
