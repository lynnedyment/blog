								<h2>A Visit with Finn and a New Play Spot for Mirei</h2>
								<p>I sure am going to miss being hugged and kissed in the mornings once Mirei leaves! She just wraps those arms around my neck, burrows in, and smiles away at me, as if I am the best thing since sliced bread. Being a Nana is certainly one of my favourite things in the world! </p>
<p>Mirei knows that I am her grandmother, but that I am called Nana. She knows too that she is my granddaughter, as she told me that today. But she didn't know that Akane's mother is also her grandmother. So we got that all straightened out. We've been having lots of discussions about my sisters, and her cousins, and how we all fit together. She's good at remembering, but she will forget once she goes back home. </p>
<p>We had invited Finn over for the morning with us. I knew Susan would have groceries to get, and Finn and Mirei haven't had much time together, due to their busy and various schedules. What busy bees they were, from the moment Finn arrived! Finn asked if I had Tinker Toys, and I do, so those came out and that last about ten minutes tops. The tub of musical instruments was next, so there were some drums banging, and whistles blowing, and harmonicas humming along, but that too ended almost as soon as it had begun. </p>
<p>Mirei got tubs of Play-Doh out for each of them after that, and they sat at the table for quite a long time, Mirei mostly rolling and making "cookies", and Finn wrapping the dough around his index finger. He took it off too quickly each time for me to get a photo of it, but it was pretty funny, that long green finger! He liked it a lot, and so did we.</p>
<p>Finn likes emptying baskets, so that was next on the agenda. He's been through the basket in the kitchen many times, and nothing holds his attention for long, so we all sang the clean up song and that was that, over and done with! </p>
<p>Out came the babies! I have about six dolls in a cradle and a doll stroller in the kitchen, so Finn was the designated "daddy", and Mirei the "mommy" and off they went, Finn with the stroller with two babies in it, and Mirei cradling one little doll, following him. Finn loves the stroller, and walked those babies many times around the kitchen, up and down the hallway and through the living room and dining room. Mirei asked for blankets for all of their babies, and that took a few minutes to get them wrapped and settled in again. Mirei was just asking for the stroller, with Finn none too happy about changing over to carrying the babies in his arms, so snack time came in very handy right then! They were both happy to sit and eat cheese and grapes, and drink apple juice together. </p>
<p>Susan came in at that point, much earlier than I had expected, as I had just put some tiny ravioli on for a slightly early lunch. Finn was tired, and I was sure Susan would want him sleeping ASAP , and that's easier on a full tummy. Susan put the kettle on, the children had some of the ravioli, and puttered around until it was time to say goodbye at 12:45. </p>
<p>Finn has been asking the last few times he has been here if he can borrow something. And so each time he takes something from my house to his house and always brings it back. Today he borrowed a plane, and walked out with it, looking as pleased as punch. </p>
<p>Susan arrived this morning with a big box of my favourite chocolates in the whole world, from Daniel's in Vancouver, Belgian chocolate extraordinaire! Each one is just pure joy for me, as they were a regular treat when we lived there. And when she arrived to pick up Finn, she came bearing flowers ... the most gorgeous tiny coral roses, over two dozen of them. What a gorgeous bouquet adorns my kitchen counter, the spot where I will see and enjoy them the most often. And there was one other treat too (we are so spoiled!), a container of Belgium chocolate pudding from Trader Joe's, the best chocolate pudding we have ever tasted, and never buy for ourselves. Susan sure does know our soft spots! </p>
<p>Mirei finished off her lunch, and then we headed up to Noe Valley for a hair cut for me. Bing was available and Mirei sat in the chair beside me, telling me I looked funny with all the clips in my hair, and trying to talk me into letting her get her hair cut too "cause, see, it's getting in my eyes." ... pulling hair from the side of her head to try to get it near her eyes! She wandered over to look at the hair styling books later on, just before we left. </p>
<p>It has been threatening to rain all day today and we did have some sprinkles on and off, so we went off to a new-to-Mirei playground/place, the Upper Noe Valley Recreation center. They have an open house from 3â€“5 each day for children under 5, and there were lots of little ones there when we walked in just after 3. Mirei was quite happy riding each type of vehicle on wheels, including a plastic doll carriage(!), and loved the little roller coaster that Riku got to try in the spring. She spent some time playing on her own with a small doll with huge hair, and at one point she just looked as though she could not figure out what to do with that hairdo! </p>
<p>But she had the best time when a boy about her age came in. They played so well and happily together for the next hour, and both were reluctant to leave when it was time. Mirei told me that maybe she would see him on another rainy day. Apparently we had quite a downpour while we were inside that room, but none of us noticed it. </p>
<p>Home for the usual nighttime routine ... tub first, then dinner, then Mirei's letters. She did some letters this morning too, writing a letter on her own while I wrote to Neal. Just as she was finishing up dinner, Mirei told me she was really tired. I suggested she choose her two books and she came back with two we hadn't read before. One was a "silent" book with no words, a gift for Riku from Auntie Kelly and family, and Mirei enjoyed it so much. She pays attention to detail and so was easily able to tell what was happening. The other was a book of opposites, told with sweet drawings of mice, so that too was a hit. I left her sleeping at 7:20 tonight.</p>
<p>Mirei's language skills are ever-growing and so today I heard her repeat something she said yesterday, patting the place beside her ... "Come and keep me company, Nana." </p>
<p>Later on, I got out a very small bowl of tiny pieces of tortilla chips and we were sharing them. I was busy in the kitchen, clearing up dishes, and Mirei said "Come and sit down and relax Nana, it's nicer to sit when we are sharing." And so it was. </p>
<p>Several times today Mirei would do something and she would tell me that "Daddy always does/says this to me!" and would then proceed to fill me in on how Bryn makes her laugh. She does such a good imitation of her daddy and it's such fun to see how his wonky sense of humour is part of his daughter's personality too now. How she loves to make people laugh! I know how quiet this house is going to be when she leaves to get on that plane for Japan.</p>
