								<h2>San Jose Discovery Museum</h2>
								<p>Mirei woke just before 7 A.M. today and after stretching, and stretching some more, she asked if it today was the day for the "new Discovery Museum?" and it is indeed. And the next thing on her mind was the GAK we came home with yesterday. There wasn't a lot of snuggling today, as she was anxious to get at it. The minute her morning routine was done... bathroom, dressed, hand wash, teeth, face and hair, she was sitting at the table happily rolling away. I sat with her over breakfast and we stretched it and braided it, and made bread dough and marked it, all to her delight. </p>
<p>This morning she went up to Doug on the computer and said to him "Show me something interesting." and up she crawled onto his lap. So cute! They were looking at random photos, not family photos, and Mirei was determined that I see all the beautiful sunsets, mountains, and bridges too! </p>
<p>We got going out to the valley later than I hoped we would, but Mirei had done her letters, and asked if she could watch "the pirate Caillou story" while I showered. She also asked if I would sit and watch Caillou with her after I showered, and so we watched an extra one together. </p>
<p>Mirei and I read four of the five books she chose for the car ride on the way down south, and then she looked at them all again as I read a bit more in my own book. One of the books mentioned currant buns, which meant we had to stop and sing our latest newest song together. </p>
<p>We stopped for lunch at a Mexican spot "Wahoo's", one of Doug's favourite valley eateries, and Mirei enjoyed her plain quesadilla very much. We stopped in Sunnyvale on an errand for Doug, and Mirei was by this time anxious to get to the museum! </p>
<p>We spent two and a half hours there and how she loved it all. The water play area was not quite as good as I remembered it from when I took Riku there, many years ago, but Mirei was happy to do some experimenting with Doug, tossing balls into the top of a tall vortex tube, and delighted when she found a smaller one that she could manage herself. There were bubbles to make, and pumpkins to weigh, a boat to row, "pushing pins" to make handprints (and faceprints if one is with Grandpa), balls to push up pressure poles, a big firetruck to sit in, gears to spin, a stage coach to ride in, and so much more, and that was all on the first floor. </p>
<p>While I had a cup of tea, Doug and Mirei wandered upstairs and I don't remember this from the last time at all. I found Mirei making Doug "pizza" in a very large "restaurant", complete with menus, a red glowing oven, lots of veggies to place on the pizza, big wooden paddles for pushing the pizza into the oven, and removing it when cooked, and tables to serve it on, complete with plates and utensils, and even a pitcher of water. Mirei loaded ours up with more vegetables; she knows how many veggies we should be taking in every day! </p>
<p>There was a grocery store on the side of this room too, with baskets and string bags, and bins filled to the brim with lots of produce. Mirei could have stayed in there for the entire hour left to us, but we managed to move her on to the other interesting spots. </p>
<p>Of course every area was just such fun for her... a small room complete with "dough" for rolling and mixing up into cookies and buns, was a hit. And she loved the tiny living room, with a table set with tea items, and babies to tend to as well. Perhaps the biggest hit in that room though was the multi-mirrored section, where not one Mirei smiled out at herself, but six or eight! Doug knew that would be a hit and it was! </p>
<p>There was so much to do, but we made a good run at doing all the things that were fun for her, ending with face painting, which I remembered so well doing with Riku and Amelia when they were a little younger than Mirei is now. Mirei likes lots of paint on her face, unlike Riku, although she did find it a little itchy on the way home. </p>
<p>We read our last book, ate lots of snacks (pistachios, an orange cream yogurt, a current favourite which Doug stocked up for her, and some grapes.), and then entertained each other by drawing on one single piece of paper all the way home. We took turns. Mirei made me a picture, and wrote my name, then I drew her a picture, and she drew a cat, and I drew a cat, and so it went almost the entire way home. I was so sure it would be difficult to keep her awake, but we had lots of fun and sang songs, and chatted away, that there just wasn't a chance for her to sleep. </p>
<p>Much to her delight, Bryn was here when we arrived and she crawled into the bed he was working on, to giggle away with him and tell him about her day. </p>
<p>Tub time, dinner time, and a first chat with Uncle Frank who called to say he has his phone in his room at last. Uncle Frank was surprised to hear Mirei's deep strong voice, as he was expecting to hear a tiny little girl's voice. Instead he heard "Hello Uncle Frank. How are you? I am fine.  (and in an aside to me she whispered "he should say "good", right Nana?") as she had told him she was fine too! I don't think he heard that part of it. Mirei sees Uncle Frank on the computer slideshow so knows his name and hears me speak of him. He is often included in our tea parties or dinner parties, as well as many of her cousins and aunts and uncles. When she said goodbye, and I had a turn on the phone, he told me her "I love you. Good night." was the sweetest thing he had heard all day. </p>
<p>Mirei was tucked in with <strong>three</strong> stories tonight! Her dad had whispered to her when he left for dinner out that she should ask me for the extra one. She chose carefully though, and two of the stories were not long ones. </p>
<p>I just remembered something Mirei said to me yesterday that made me laugh out loud. I had said something to her using a "baby" voice and she said very sternly to me "Talk properly, Nana. Daddy doesn't like to listen to that kind of voice." </p>
