								<h2>Visiting with Finn and Amelia</h2>
								<p>Mirei slept for eleven hours last night, so we are back to a more normal sleep routine for her. That was an easy transition for her jet lag, sleeping right through for four nights in a row, and an easy transition for us too! </p>
<p>Finn came over for a visit at 9:30 this morning. He and Mirei played together upstairs and in the kitchen, but also spent some time on their own ... Finn with me in the garden, and Mirei with her doctor's kit bandaging up animals in her own room. </p>
<p>Susan showed up at noon with two bunches of pinky-coral tulips for me, as well as big deli sandwiches and two bags of chips for us all to share. The sandwiches were so big that Bryn and I both ate just half, as did Susan; the children had already eaten eggs and toast and so weren't hungry. Nice to have a "picnic" that someone else made! </p>
<p>We made arrangements to meet up with them at the 23rd street playground after Finn's nap, and after Amelia was out of school for the day. Mirei is always happy to play with Play-Doh, so we did that for a little bit, she played with her babies, we went outside to do some sweeping, but the highlight was taking her tricycle out on the sidewalk, so she could peddle up and down all by herself. It was hard going in the backyard, as she had to keep steering in circles, and not all the leaves & garden debris have been picked up yet. Mirei was very proud of herself, as she went all the way up and down our block on her own (except for some help on the slight hill going up and slowing her down on the way down!). </p>
<p>I wanted to give my back a break before going on to the playground, so she and Doug sat at the table while she wrote out the alphabet for him. She came up to show me her handiwork, and to point out that Grandpa had done the other drawing on the page. Mirei is always happy to write or identify letters and/or numbers, so it's easy to entertain her when we have a few minutes to put in. </p>
<p>We drove to the playground just after 3 P.M., and Mirei was delighted to see Amelia. Me too! She has gotten taller and looked very grown up in her school uniform. She and Mirei played so well together, and later all three children started pulling up "weeds" in the grassy area and pretending it was soup in Mirei's hat, used for a pot! </p>
<p>One of the children from Riku's grade one class came up and said "Hello, Riku's grandmother"! And then his brother came up and asked if I was Riku's mother. It was Justin and Jonathon(?), and we talked for a little bit, and then I introduced myself to their father, José, and filled him in on how Riku was doing. Justin and his family had been to México in August, so they weren't around when Riku was here, as was true of so many of his classmates. However, Justin did give me his address, and his dad says he will write and draw pictures for Riku for certain, as he enjoys doing both. </p>
<p>Susan sent me home with a bag full of magazines, for both Doug and me, licorice for me, chocolate mints for Doug, and a cookbook from the farm they go to as a family every year. Doug read out a couple of recipes to me that sounded good to him! </p>
<p>After Mirei's tub and dinner, Mirei said she would like to do a puzzle. We went upstairs together and instead of a puzzle she chose three alphabet/number sets. So, we sat in the living room with the large alphabet cards I had given her two years ago, and she read off each one to me, checking to see where the little girl with the red hair was on each. Then she chose the rubber alphabet board and put all the letters in backwards just for fun. And it was fun, as she would pretend to hide a few of them, raise her eyebrows and ask me where it was, claim that she didn't know, and then produce it with a big chuckle. What a girl! Our last evening event had Mirei tipping out rubber numbers from a mat and then having her ask me for each of them, carefully placing them in the right spots. Mirei liked being the "teacher" for this last one! </p>
<p>She was tucked in and asleep by 7:25 and I dozed off for ten minutes myself. Busy days.</p>
