								<h2>A Windy Hour at a Beach and Sunshine in Potrero Hill</h2>
								<p>Mirei slept her usual eleven and a half hours again tonight; she never complains about going to bed, and I think the time we spend outside running around is a big part of this. It sure works for me! I was up too late last night reading, so will be in bed earlier tonight for sure. Mirei kept suggesting we snuggle this morning and would lie quietly beside me, not even talking. It was a lovely quiet waking this morning for both of us, and I guess she was ready for it too. </p>
<p>This morning at breakfast Mirei suggested that she do her "homework" and so printing out her alphabet was over with very early today. She watched a couple of Pingu episodes while I showered, but then we came right downstairs as we had work to do. The little desk in the kitchen that the children use has been getting messier and messier as Mirei explored every box and container, added papers and her books to it, and lots of writing paper too. So together we cleared everything off, sorted it out carefully, so now Riku's box contains only his things once more, and we went through sharpening the pencil crayons too. Mirei helped with it all, and did a very good job sharpening the pencils. Then she helped me test the markers and we tossed the ones that weren't working anymore.</p>
<p>I have wanted to have the numbers up on the white board again, just so that they are visible for Mirei when she is at the table. She likes to either be the teacher or have me take that role, and having the numbers up again, and the days of the week on the fridge, gave us plenty of teaching moments over the course of the day. Mirei knows her alphabet so well that I didn't bother putting that up again, but we did decide to hang the sign on the fridge that tells us what the day was like. Today the word was "sunny." </p>
<p>Based on that, we had plans to go to the beach today. It was a little overcast until after our lunch, but as soon as I packed up snacks for us, we headed over to the other side of the city. By the time we got to the Marina district, the temperature had definitely dropped, but we sat on a long stretch of beach, with only part of the Golden Gate bridge visible through the fog! I had taken our jackets with us, and a scarf for me, and so we sat, bundled up, making sand cakes and castles. I had forgotten my camera, which was such a shame as there were certainly some "Kodak moments" as Mirei happily dug in the sand, oblivious to the wind. She even told me "I don't mind the wind, do you Nana?" I didn't mind it for an hour but then it started to blow and it wasn't fun any longer. Mirei was fine with changing to a warmer spot, and so we headed over to our side of town again.</p>
<p>I had a tape of children's songs in the player, and Mirei heard "This Old Man ..." for the first time, I think. We sang it over and over, and will have another addition to her list of new songs learned or relearned on this trip. As well as the original versions, Mirei has become very fond of making up her own words to the same tunes, sometimes with a similar theme, but not always. Sometimes it is <strong>not</strong> five little ducks out on a walk, but four goats eating some food. She is very inventive but most of this singing happens in the car, where I can't record it. One day I will get a bit of these little gems on video. </p>
<p>Mirei has very strong opinions about songs she hears, and today told me three times "I don't like that song." If they don't have a verse that repeats so that she can join in, I think that eliminates it from her playlist. Some of the songs are very complicated and I haven't learned them after hearing them played over and over again. Riku is happy to listen to the words and enjoy that aspect of them, but not Mirei. She is interactive! </p>
<p>I let Mirei choose the sunny playground and of course she chose the one with the "swinging steps" again! It was incredibly warm and we went from jackets to just a light sweater for Mirei and to just my blouse and no scarf for me. What an interesting place this is. We stayed there for about an hour, and had to park at the Safeway store a long block and a half away. Now Mirei knows what a block is. There were lots of children there today, mostly younger ones with their nannies, and so Mirei had lots of children to observe at play, one of her favourite things to do. She continues to practice climbing <strong>up</strong> the slides although is very careful when the little ones are using the same one. </p>
<p>And of course we had our usual nighttime routine ... bath as soon as we came in, followed by dinner, with me reading to Mirei during dinner, and time for some colouring after dinner. At one point Mirei joined two of the pencils together and pretended it was a magic wand; I crowned her a princess, and then she did me the same honour. Taking care of a child could not be easier than with this happy little girl. She is just so reasonable, and so makes it easy to just enjoy every minute with her, literally. I told a friend today that having Mirei around is like having a small companion, as it just doesn't feel like "babysitting." </p>
<p>Mirei often chooses not to have dessert here, although I think she almost always does at home. I always offer it to her... fruit, or custard, or strawberry ice cream and although Riku would almost always choose fruit, Mirei more often than not says "No thank you, Nana. I am full." and that is that. But tonight she opted for the Devon custard I try to keep on hand for the children, and some strawberries. She had lots of grapes today too, so I am happy to have her eating more fruit that she was when she first arrived. She and Finn went through lots of red grapes yesterday too. </p>
<p>Last night, Mirei chose a sweet story in a mouse series about opposites; she is clear on that concept, and so tonight chose two more in the same series ... numbers, and the alphabet. She really enjoys these books; the illustrations are delightful with lots of humour, so it is fun to read them to her and listen to her reactions to what the mice are doing on each page. </p>
<p>Tonight Mirei was talking about cousins and aunts and uncles and remembered that she had gone to Auntie Gail's and Uncle Tom's house "one day". She is trying to sort out yesterday and tomorrow and this morning asked about morning, afternoon, and evening. There is so much to learn and she's keeping on top of it all. She even knows about step-mothers and step-brothers and sisters now, and reminded me that not every stepmother is a mean one. </p>
<p>Mirei was fast asleep at 7:20 tonight and I am heading off to bed early myself. We are hoping to be off to the Bay Area Discovery Museum in the morning, if the rain holds off for us. </p>
