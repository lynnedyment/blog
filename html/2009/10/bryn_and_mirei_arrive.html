								<h2>Bryn and Mirei Arrive!</h2>
								<p>Bryn's and Mirei's plane touched down a half hour early this morning, and we were there to see those smiling faces as they walked through the gate. Mirei had her hair cut last month, and the shorter more structured cut is adorable on her. Bryn looked fit and well, and had a great flight with Mirei. He said not only did she sleep for four hours, not something he was sure would happen, but she napped in the limo on the way to the airport, and was a delightful traveling companion: happy, entertaining, and quiet. I'm sure their seat companions nearby appreciated that too! </p>
<p>Mirei walked in the house and within minutes was back doing just what she always did ... serving us "breakfast" from the little kitchen area, tending to her two dolls in the cradle and stroller, deciding to draw me a picture, followed by asking to paint, then use the Play-Doh, and finally ending this morning's activities by going off to the living room to read on the sofa. Whew! </p>
<p>Bryn left with Doug after noon to pick up his rental car, and was heading straight off after that to Murphys, a very small town in central California, to meet up with groom-to-be Brent and others for the pre-wedding guy party. Mirei gave him a big hug when he left, and gave her Grandpa a big hug too. </p>
<p>We puttered about, doing this and that downstairs. I was busy with laundry, too, and she was happy to just poke about rediscovering old toys. The bag of various necklaces came out and Mirei was busy stringing those around her neck, but decided not to use any of the necklaces with shells on them. Interesting. They would have been Riku's first choice!  </p>
<p>She had Doug busy catching and tossing a ball to her at one point, and then she joined me upstairs while I was having a quiet cup of tea. We decided to just drop the ball from various heights into each other's hands. I got lots of snuggles in there too! She pulled Bryn's old play farm up on the bed  with us and she chatted away about animals, and Old MacDonald, singing the song too, of course. </p>
<p>The afternoon passed quickly, Mirei ate a hearty late lunch, and then we walked over on this bright sunny warm day to the playground on Potrero Avenue, singing nursery rhymes as we went.</p>
<p>We passed a funky car on the way, and Mirei posed very prettily beside it after noticing I was just going to take a shot of the car! </p>
<p>Once at the playground, she climbed, went down the slides, climbed up on the big structure there about halfway only today, and used all the other playground equipment too. We walked home slowly, with Mirei stopping to poke a small stick into whatever holes in the sidewalk and walls that she could find. About a half block from the house, she declared she was tired, but didn't ask to be carried. She must have been soooo tired after such a long, long day. </p>
<p>I popped her into a warm tub with bubbles and two "babies" to wash and shampoo, and made her up a big dinner of eggs, "bacon", half a bagel, corn, and edamame. I was pouring her some milk and realized she hadn't said a word; I just assumed she was busy eating, but instead found her slowly drifting sideways, as she was off to sleep! I wanted her to eat more than she had, but it was no use at all. She managed a couple more bites, once I put her on my lap, but then she snuggled into my shoulder, I carried her off to bed, and shut the door at 7:45. I do hope she sleeps through the night and wakens happily adjusted to the time change, but we shall see. </p>
<p>Such a sweet loving girl is Mirei! We all got lots of hugs and kisses throughout the day, and as always she had us laughing at her antics. How she loves to make people laugh! </p>
<p>I'm a bit jet lagged myself, mostly because I didn't sleep long enough the last few nights before leaving Ontario, so it's going to be an early night for me too. </p>
