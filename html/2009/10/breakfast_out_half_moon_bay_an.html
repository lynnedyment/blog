								<h2>Breakfast Out, Half Moon Bay, and Four Pumpkins</h2>
								<p>Bryn and Mirei both woke at 7 this morning, not long after I did. They had a breakfast date with Sean and Gen' at "Just for You" this morning at 8:15, followed by a day in Half Moon Bay at the pumpkin patch for Mirei with Sean and Gen'. So the hour we had together flew by. Bryn sat at the table with Mirei, cutting out her name in big pink letters so she could glue them onto a paper she had and I had stained pink using the bougainvillea blossoms she found last night. She ate a big bowl of oatmeal, with banana and blueberries and nuts in it, and I packed up a lunch and snack bag for her just before they left, waving goodbye from the car window, and Mirei blowing double-handed kisses to me too. </p>
<p>Doug was being interviewed by Gregg for a pod feed today, part of a travel convention that is going on in Toronto, and while that was going on, Caillie called to chat. She had been to the convention earlier in the day but was very anxious to find out the name of a magazine full of Hallowe'en costumes that Riku had with him here in August. </p>
<p>Mirei wasn't back until after 2:30, and I made good use of those hours, finally finishing up all the paper work from the kitchen counter, and getting all sorts of little jobs done. I also wrote dozens of emails, catching up there a bit too. But of course the time flew and what fun to have Mirei come racing up the steps with four small pumpkins gathered in her arms, telling me they were all for me! (Later, Doug told me that she had told <strong>him</strong> that one was for Daddy, one for Grandpa, one for me, and one for her.)</p>
<p>Sean and Gen' obviously were just great with her, as over the next few hours we heard all about all the things she had done: fed the goats, bounced in the bouncy castle four times, taken the train ride, and had ice cream too, as well as all of the food I had packed for her. </p>
<p>She was hot so we got her cooled down with a cool facecloth, and took off the tights she had been wearing with her skirt, and then she donned an apron and we started making a carrot cake. I had told her this morning we needed to do some baking as the date squares were almost finished. Mirei finished off the last tiny piece as a snack (I'm so glad she likes them!) after she got home, along with some grapes and cucumber slices. </p>
<p>Mirei loves to help in the kitchen, of course, and today did a great job pulling the egg apart once she had cracked the shell. She even held the pieces way up in the air and looked ever so professional doing so! So she did the usual scooping, measuring, pouring, turning the mixer bowl, adding and sniffing, and insisting on helping me carry it to the oven too. We will ice it tomorrow. </p>
<p>Mirei did her letters with Doug and it was fun to just listen to the two of them as they worked together. She also had a little time with Grandpa on the computer after we had finished mixing up the cake batter. She came back to me in time to smooth the batter and drink some of the pineapple juice left over after straining the pineapple we add to it. </p>
<p>Then she and Doug went up to watch "Horton Hears a Who" while I prepared macaroni and cheese for dinner and did the cleaning up. I had it in the oven and was delighted when Bryn contacted Akane in Japan, and I had a chance to talk to Riku on the phone. </p>
<p>It's a rare event for many reasons, but it's Sunday there today and so he, his mom, and Akane's cousin were all there, but ready to leave the house soon. Unfortunately the connection was really poor, and Riku and I spent a lot of time saying "Pardon?", but he told me about a dream, and about a frog that almost got hit by a car, and that he was coming to San Francisco again next summer. I was able to tell him that I would be in Japan with Grandpa too, not long after Bryn and Mirei get home. </p>
<p>Mirei was a very tired girl and cried when Bryn brought her downstairs for dinner at 5:30. Doug had put in a second video for her and of course she wanted to sit there and watch it.. I'm sure she would have fallen asleep in just a few minutes, and I was sorry I spent so much time making dinner. I would have put on a short Caillou for her instead, and had her in the tub before dinner. We'll keep to the usual routine from now on of videos in the mornings, as Mirei has such active days that the TV just makes her sleepier still. I know the feeling well! </p>
<p>Her little upset didn't last too much longer and soon she was her usual smiling self, being silly, and interacting with all of us. She ate a good-sized dinner with lots of saut√©ed spinach on the side. </p>
<p>We showed her Daddy how we were doing left hand, right hand maneuvers yesterday on the steps outside: left arm over right arm, left hand touching right ear, right foot over left leg, etc. It was lots of fun and of course Bryn had her putting her right arm behind her head to touch her left ear. Once Bryn and Doug left the table, she and I did a new song for her. Actually, she had heard it before, but told me "I don't remember that song" and so we went over "Tommy Thumb ... " three times and she had the gist of it pretty quickly. We did the number flash cards too, and Mirei continues to practice holding up her fingers to figure out some of the sums. </p>
<p>Doug and Bryn went off on BART tonight to a concert together, leaving the house at 7 P.M. Mirei was out of the tub shortly after that, and tucked into bed with two stories tonight, "Goodnight Moon" and "The Very Quiet Cricket", both of which she enjoyed very much. Mirei has lots of questions now about letters and what words they make up, so we talked about go, and good and goodnight all being in the same word. </p>
<p>I am going to do a second entry for today, as I want to put the photos of Mirei baking the carrot cake up as well, so that will follow.I am going to end with some Mirei quotes, as she is expressing herself so very clearly these days, and learning new words or coming out with new expressions every single day. </p>
<p>"I wish you could have come too." ... meaning the pumpkin patch excursion</p>
<p>"It was a very busy day today and I am tired." ... said after giving up on the trike ride outside with Doug. </p>
<p>"I wanted to drink some water 'cause it was hot walking around today at the pumpkin patch." </p>
<p>"I had a <strong>good</strong> time at the pumpkin patch." </p>
<p>... and, after doing the letter P with Doug ... "That is an excellent P."  (if she did say so herself!)</p>
