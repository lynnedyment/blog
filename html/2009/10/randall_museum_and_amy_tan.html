								<h2>Randall Museum and Amy Tan</h2>
								<p>Mirei was lying quietly beside me this morning, watching me until I opened my eyes, not quite awake after a restless night. Now that I am booked for both Japan and Ontario, my mind was reeling with all that I have to do in the next two weeks and then in two days between those trips. Not that thinking about it helps at all, and in fact it would be much better if I just slept and saved all that energy for the next day when I could actually do something about it! I was very grateful that Mirei was happy to snuggle next to me for an extra fifteen minutes or so. I am always aware of her watching me, waiting for me to roll over and say good morning to her. </p>
<p>After breakfast we went upstairs; I got started on some ironing and Mirei watched a few Pingu episodes. She really likes me to sit beside her and watch them, though, and of course I am only too happy to do so. Today she had her cereal upstairs for a "special treat", as she had eaten her egg and toast earlier downstairs. </p>
<p>We mixed butter up before lunch and it was the first time Mirei had helped me with this little chore. She carefully unwrapped the butter, turned my slow mixing bowl around and around, and added the oil carefully. When it was time to scoop out the remainder of the soft butter at the end of it all, she held the spatula with me and helped with that too. There is now enough butter in the freezer to do us until the New Year. </p>
<p>Doug took Mirei off to the Randall Musem this afternoon, giving me three hours to get at some chores around the house, and tend to some paper work too. They had a great time, and Doug took lots of photos. She especially enjoyed patting the bunnies but also spent some time with two very young children which is always fun for her. She's gentle with them and the moms are always very complimentary about this loving part of her personality. </p>
<p>I needed a break and some fresh air, so once they arrived home Mirei and I went outside to do some gardening work. We swept, and picked up a huge number of pine needles there hadn't been room for in the composting bin this week, and it looked much better after that was done. Mirei enjoyed it as much as I did, and then was ready for her tub. </p>
<p>While I made dinner, Bryn sat with her while she called out numbers from the flash cards we discovered the other day. She is good at it, and laughed when Bryn kept telling her to do it "faster, faster!". </p>
<p>Dinner was over nice and early tonight, and Mirei had time to make me some fruit and tea, and then time with Raggedy Andy and Raggedy Ann. Once again, Raggedy Andy was in trouble for pinching and she gave him quite a talking to. That Raggedy Andy! He never seems to learn! </p>
<p>Bryn tucked Mirei into bed tonight and just before doing so, I had a question for her. Here's the story:Mirei has been sleeping in the smaller of the downstairs bedroom, on her own, until I join her sometime after 11 o'clock. She usually, but not always, wakens about that time and cries out for me. I go in, tell her I will be there soon, and back to sleep she goes. So for the past few nights I have been asking her not to cry but to just roll over and go back to sleep, knowing that I would be coming to bed with her soon. Mirei always looks thoughtful about it, and I thought she had the idea. So, tonight while she was waiting for Bryn to read to her, I asked her what she was going to do if she woke up and I wasn't there, and her immediate answer was "cry." We all howled, perhaps not the wisest thing to do, but it was so funny!  I reminded her she was to just go back to sleep and I would be there when it was my bedtime.  </p>
<p>Doug had won two free tickets to an Amy Tan roasting tonight, actually called a braising as no one wanted to be too tough on her. It was a great evening. I was so tired, I would have been happy to stay home, but have only seen Amy once before, many years ago at a reading. I wasn't tired sitting through all the funny and sweet speeches and songs, though, and the evening ended on such a great note, with Roger McGuinn of "The Byrds" singing four of his big hits, with Amy joining him for "Mr. Tambourine Man", playing the tambourine. </p>
<p>Bryn was in with Mirei when we got home at 10:30, but emerged soon after, telling me that Mirei had fallen asleep just shortly after 8:30. I was wondering if she might have trouble nodding off tonight, as she had napped for fifteen minutes on the way home from the Randall Museum with Doug, and that is enough to give her a second wind.</p>
