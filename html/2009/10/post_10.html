								<h2>Our Last BADM Day for 2009</h2>
								<p>It was a lovely day today, for our final visit to the Bay Area Discovery Museum which, I believe, is Mirei's very favourite place to visit. And so it was the perfect thing to do on this, her last day here for this year. I wonder if she will be too tall by her next visit to go into the tots' area, but I think, and hope, not! </p>
<p>Mirei got to talk to her Auntie Kelly early this morning and she was very excited about this! Kelly was home sick from school with a nasty cough, and called just as Mirei was eating her breakfast. Kelly sang her three Hallowe'en songs, and Mirei knew two of them — "Five Little Pumpkins" and "It's Hallowe'en" — but she claimed she knew a third one too! How funny that she would pretend this, and later in the car we went over it a couple of times. It starts out with "It was a dark dark night, and there was a dark dark house, and in the dark dark house there was a dark dark room ... " It's fun, and is spoken in a low voice, and how I wish I had remembered it to teach to Riku last year. </p>
<p>We had a lazy morning at home, as we spent some time gathering up Mirei's clothes and toys for the trip to Japan tomorrow. Mirei was a willing helper in this, and started off by neatly taking all of her clothes out of the three drawers in her room, and laying them on the bed. Then we went through each room, finding anything that had to go back with her. In the morning, while we were still snuggling, Mirei asked if she could take Raggedy Ann with her on the plane, promising to take good care of her on the trip and at home too. Raggedy belongs to Kelly though, and I didn't feel I should send her off without permission first, but Mirei didn't mention it again during the day and so Raggedy is still here with Raggedy Andy, sitting on the ottoman in the living room, waiting for Mirei to return one day. We had things pretty much in order around here, and so soon had a nice big stack of clothes and toys on the second bed in Bryn's room, waiting for him to pack it all up tomorrow morning. </p>
<p>And then it was off to the Museum for us! We left just before lunch, and as Mirei had eaten a big bowl of porridge not long before that, she asked if we could start off in the room with the "sand". It's interesting, as she doesn't bother much with the supply Susan loaned us many years ago, and yet she will sit and play with it for the longest time at the Discovery Museum. Really I think she likes to have an excuse to sit down with all the other children and watch and listen to them as they play. I talked her into painting with her hands on a piece of paper today, though, so that was fun to see. She patted her hand prints all over a large sheet of paper, and we left it drying on a rack, to pick up later on. </p>
<p>Mirei wore her mismatched shoes again today, just for fun, and I remembered to take a photo of it. You can see her new look in the photo with the sticks. </p>
<p>Following that came our picnic lunch, with Mirei's favourite grilled cheese sandwich and some of the grapes I had taken along for us. Then it was on to the water beds, in the little tots' area, putting on a great spider costume, and watching in dismay as one little boy tried to keep all the stuffed animals to himself. The minute he disappeared for a few minutes, all the other children would race in and grab one or two of them each. Finally, he left, as did most of the other children, and Mirei and another little girl hurried into the "cave" to put the animals to sleep. </p>
<p>Outside at last, Mirei spent a lot of time on the boat today, more than usual, as she got to spend lots of time steering it, and rushing up and down the decks with other children her age. From there it was on to the boat wreck to see if she could find some hidden "treasures" in the sand. She did indeed ... the five pennies, and the one nickel that I buried for her, plus one on the ground and a sixth penny in another spot in the sand. How excited she was and stopped to carefully put them all in her pocket. The garden area was next, and she stopped to "spin" a web and plant the big plastic spider in the centre of it, then went through the twig house. Riku loves to be chased through this fabulous house but Mirei is happy for now to just wander around in it on her own. </p>
<p>There were drums outside today, and the nice young man who always recognizes Mirei came up to say hello, and goodbye, to her once more, as he knows she was due to go home soon. I'm sure they will see each other again. Mirei sat with a little fellow playing with the drums for a while, and then we headed home, after "just <strong>five</strong> more minutes playing at the sand table. </p>
<p>I had hoped we might spot a deer on the way out, up in the hills. We had talked about them on the way in, but Mirei has never seen them, or at least not that she or I remember. And I saw one, grazing with his head down! She was so excited and so I drove to the top of the winding road and turned around, but it was on a curving piece of road on the way back up and I couldn't risk stopping the car long enough to point the animal out to her. One day... </p>
<p>We played "I spy... " on the way home again (Mirei really likes it; she likes to take turns too... such a good sport!), and she had some snacks to eat to keep her awake. It is just the worst time of the day to be in the car, with her alone in the back seat. We left quite late today too, but she did so very well, and we sang too, and kept ourselves busy all the way back home. </p>
<p>While I was preparing dinner tonight I glanced into the living room to find Mirei sitting on the coffee table "reading" a book on her own, with her feet wound around the legs of the table. I realized at that point, for the very first time,  that I never give a thought to Mirei doing something that she shouldn't be; if I am not sure where she is, I will find her either in her room or the living room looking at books, or upstairs in our bedroom, playing with the plastic toys in a big container in the corner, or sitting on our bed with her "babies" or reading. She can often be found in her room too, on the bed, putting the babies to sleep or lying down reading to them. This was true of Riku too; he was almost always looking at books, and I certainly never had to check to see if he was getting into something he shouldn't. I also realized this was true of Kelly and Bryn. Bryn could always be found with his Lego blocks, and Kelly would more often be looking at books or playing with her babies. Interesting to have this come to me today. </p>
<p>After dinner, with tub-time over beforehand, we played with the rubber alphabet letters for a while at the table. Mirei likes to mix them all up, with the numbers too, and then ask me to find the right ones. When I do, she gives me lots of praise, saying "Good job!" before calling out the next one. When we're finished we rush to beat each other at putting in more than the other. </p>
<p>But today Mirei started stacking the letters and this was such fun that she kept at it until she had five or six of the letters carefully balanced, one on top of the other. She even told me that "we have to be careful and choose the letters that are flat." </p>
<p>It was a little more than sad to see Mirei choosing her last books to read tonight. I love watching her in her plaid pink PJs, standing or crouching in front of the bookcases in the living room, carefully going through to find two we haven't read for a while or have never read. The minute her night time routine is over, she hops into bed (after first putting the pillows down so that she can pull the duvet down, crawl in under it, and stack the pillows in exactly the right places. </p>
<p>Mirei is very excited about going home tomorrow; she is so happy she will soon be seeing her mommy and her brother, but she also told me she is sad she is leaving me too. How I will miss her! But, she knows that I am going to be there with her soon too, and so that makes this last night much easier for me, and possibly for her too. I will miss that little arm around my neck, and her quiet little "I love you very much Nana. Good night." </p>
