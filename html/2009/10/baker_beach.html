								<h2>Baker Beach</h2>
								<p>Mirei and I had talked about going to the beach today, if it was as sunny and warm as it was yesterday. While I was showering I heard on the radio that it was going to be clear and sunny, so we were finally going to have some time at the beach! </p>
<p>I wanted to go once it warmed up, so we had a relaxing morning.We lay in bed for quite a while; she had taken the Raggedy Ann doll to bed last night, the one I made for Kelly about thirty-nine years ago! She asked this morning if she could take Raggedy Ann to Japan, but not with her pants, but just her dress and apron. We left it at "maybe" as I don't want her to get lost in the shuffle of flying there, even though Mirei promised she would take very good care of her. </p>
<p>Last night, Mirei and I read a book about colours and an elephant named Elmer. Mirei noticed the back cover as we finished the book, as it had a tiny drawing of a tree with multiple coloured leaves on it. We decided we would make that the next day, and Mirei remembered this. First she made a cherry pie while eating breakfast, and I promised we would do the art after I showered. She watched a Caillou DVD while I showered, and I watched the end of one episode with her as she does like company so we can talk about what is happening. </p>
<p>So, then came the art project! I drew the leaves on the different colours of paper, and Mirei did all the cutting herself, being very careful with each of them. She did the gluing too, paying careful attention, and stuck them in the same order as the illustration. I drew the little bird for the top of the tree and Mirei glued and placed it. Then  Mirei coloured in the base with a soft pink, which also matched the picture, asking me to finish it, while she drew in a sun and clouds. We were both very pleased with the result! She ran in to present it to her dad, who leaned it against the bookcases in his bedroom, right beside where he works. </p>
<p>And then it was off to the beach! I packed up a snack pack, as Mirei had a full bowl of cereal as a late breakfast filler-upper. It was sunny when we arrived at Baker Beach, and we sat making "cookies" and "cakes" for the longest time. However, the fog started rolling in after we had some snacks and Mirei complained of being cold! This never happens, but she snuggled up against me, and tucked her hands and, at one point, her feet, into my snuggly jacket. She and I both decided we would go to a playground near home as it was hot over on our side of the city. </p>
<p>However, I wanted just a few photos of Mirei near the water, and so we wandered closer to the big waves, and she just loved it. Unfortunately, most of the wonderful shots I took of her jumping and running and finding treasures and staring out at the Pacific Ocean were overexposed. I was so disappointed! We might just have to get back to a beach within the next two days! </p>
<p>It was a good thing that we didn't leave immediately, as I had left a message for Susan telling her where we would be at the beach, in case they wanted to join us, and they did, along with a friend of Amelia's. Finn and Mirei had lots of fun together; Finn played with the trucks and cars from our big bag of toys, and Mirei made more food. Amelia and Sheena went down closer to the waves, further along the beach, and Susan joined them. </p>
<p>A couple had two box turtles out for a run on the beach, so all the children had a chance to see how fast they move, and saw them digging themselves into the wet sand too. Mirei stayed with them for a long time, and touched one turtle that was staying quite still for a bit. </p>
<p>Along with that excitement was a group of five martial arts students, being filmed doing their moves along the edge of the water. The waves were really rolling in, and they must have been cold, but it sure was entertaining watching them go through their paces! </p>
<p>Finn didn't nap today or yesterday, so we all headed home at the same time, about 3:30. Mirei drew more pumpkins for me on the way, and we sang some of our favourite songs, as usual. Today we were back to "Five current buns in a baker's shop ..." and "This Old Man". Mirei was great and didn't doze off for even a minute. </p>
<p>Bryn was home, so she had a little cuddle with him before getting into a very full tub with all her animals. I just had to reheat some pasta for her dinner, and steam some broccoli, so it was on the table for her in just minutes. She was a hungry girl, despite lots of snacks, including a full container of yogurt, at the beach. Mirei wanted to "do Play-Doh" again, and so she ended her day by making cookies and cakes too! We really do have to make a cherry pie, and carve her pumpkin too! </p>
<p>Today we talked about her leaving for home in three days. I have the days of the week posted on the fridge and we have been going over them for a few days now. This morning, as yesterday, we named each day, so that she would know exactly when that was happening. While she was drifting off to sleep tonight, she was quietly naming them all ... Monday through Sunday, all in order, for the very first time since we started this last week. </p>
<p>Mirei is looking forward to going home, but also knows that I will be there "very soon", and also knows that she will be back too "Daddy said that." </p>
<p>She was asleep at 7:30 tonight, and I made a hot cup of tea, sat in the living room, and was really lazy for a half hour or more. Doug had emptied the dishwasher earlier, and Bryn cleaned up the dinner dishes, and I was a very happy woman to find both these jobs done. Laundry and emails awaited me, but I prefer those to a messy kitchen at the end of a fun and busy day. </p>
