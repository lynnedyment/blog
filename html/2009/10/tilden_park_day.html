								<h2>Tilden Park Day</h2>
								<p>Mirei slept until just after 8 o'clock today, giving her a solid twelve and a half hours of sleep. I think the jet lag is over and she has settled into a regular sleep now. As soon as she saw Doug eating his breakfast this morning, she decided she wanted to eat exactly what he was eating, so it was a container of yogurt, a cinnamon raisin English muffin, and juice for her, or at least for the first course of her morning meal. </p>
<p>She watched "a different Caillou, the blue one" today while I showered. Later, while she was making lots of party dishes for me in the kitchen, I told her Daddy was coming back today, and her reply was "Today? Tuesday?!";  I learned later from Bryn that Tuesday is her day of choice when she feels driven to name a day. </p>
<p>I am hearing lots of "Oh my goodness" and "Oh my gosh!" from this little girl lately, as well as many other expressions that sound like me. </p>
<p>It has been a long time since we had Mirei at the little steam train ride in Tilden Park in Berkeley, so I packed up a picnic lunch and off we went. First stop was the "Redwood Valley Railway Company" and we lucked out in that the smaller, and free train was running when we got there. We had to wait a little bit for the steam to build up, and it was chilly standing there, but once on the train we were in the sunshine and it was much more pleasant. </p>
<p>We were able to get on the larger train immediately and Mirei pointed out every small building along the route. There was a group with five children sitting behind us, and as always Mirei spent a lot of time observing them, able to tell me later how many were boys and how many were girls. She doesn't miss very much, this girl! </p>
<p>It was time for lunch and so we drove close to the small farm in the park, enjoying our lunch sitting on a bench in the sunshine. Mirei was anxious to finish up and play in the playground, so after half of hers was finished I let her run off and come back for bites. There is a series of small climbing rocks here, and Mirei climbed them all. She did a great job except that she insisted on climbing down the last foot or so standing looking out! </p>
<p>We played ball for the longest time, using a small pink ball someone had left behind. We bounced it, rolled out, and tossed it over the course of the hour we spent there, and had lots of fun. Then it was time to stroll off to the little farm, a much larger area than Doug remembered it being from many years ago. Mirei saw cows up very close, goats, sheep, turkeys, both wild and domestic, ducks, chickens, rabbits, and rams, and managed to find a few pieces of lettuce and celery to feed to two cows. </p>
<p>On the way home, Mirei asked me to point out the numbers in the Sudoku book I had in the car, so with the point of my pencil, I was the "teacher" and was surprised that she recognized the numbers to nine. She hadn't known them when she went to Japan in March, and so it was the first time I realized that she had learned them. </p>
<p>We sang lots of songs on this trip and Mirei has started doing what Brynnie did when he was a little guy ... making up the words for new songs. I recorded her doing this yesterday, and wish I had gotten my camera out today to do more of it. Once home we continued singing, and just before Bryn came home, about 7:15, we had been singing about the ducks not coming back. She will have this down pat within the week I am sure. </p>
<p>Tub time, of course, and then dinner, since she had snacked on the way home with her leftover lunch, and then Bern, Bryn's friend, came over to say hello to her just before her bedtime. Mirei was thrilled to bits to have her here with her, and they played with all the "food" and dishes in the little kitchen, making more party food as she had this morning. Guess we have a party girl on our hands! </p>
<p>I took Mirei off to bed, just as Bryn and Bern were leaving for a concert. It was 8:15 when she fell asleep; it took her a little longer to settle down after her excitement of having both her Daddy and Bern here. She told Bryn she missed him <strong>so</strong> much, and she was <strong>so</strong> glad he was home. He looked mighty pleased himself, after having had a great weekend wedding celebration with Brent, Mikela, and all their guests. </p>
