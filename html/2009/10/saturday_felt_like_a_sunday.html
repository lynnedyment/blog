								<h2>Saturday ... Felt Like a Sunday!</h2>
								<p>Mirei slept until 10:33 this morning! Even though she was awake for perhaps an hour and a half after 10 last night, she still slept twelve and a half hours. She has done so well with this adjustment to West Coast time, and stumbled into the kitchen squinting and smiling. After a cuddle and some hugs on my lap, she went right to her little kitchen to get me something to "eat", just as though that was her duty. I prepared eggs, toast, and "bacon" for us while I was served fruit and juice. She obviously knows me well. We had a very lazy morning, and Mirei watched "the green Caillou" while I showered just before noon. I must say I love mornings we don't have to dash off.</p>
<p>We didn't have much in the way of plans for today at all. It's the weekend and often the places we would like to go to are very busy. We did have casual plans with Susan to possibly meet up at Ocean Beach this afternoon, but set off after lunch to a Vegetarian Food fair near Mirei's Japanese nursery school. As we drove her by the school, we noticed the door was open, so stopped to see if Mirei's teacher was there. She was, and greeted Mirei with a big smile. Mirei was quite shy with her, but did want to go inside the door. The teacher and her husband were decorating for Hallowe'en, and so Mirei saw a little bit of that. We made arrangements for Mirei to go to school on Fridays, from 9â€“1, and then she will go on to play with Jonah, a little boy from her class, after that. Right now Mirei is saying that she doesn't want to go to that school, or to go to Jonah's house, but we shall see how she is feeling closer to the day that will happen. </p>
<p>The Vegetarian Fair was interesting, and Mirei was quite happy trying out various samples of yogurt, vegan cookies, tofu, veggie "chips", juices, and coconut ice cream. She also picked up some stickers and chose a poster of healthy food choices, done in a cartoon style, that is now hanging in her room. There was a friendly gal who invited Mirei over to colour, so she did that, and chatted away with her, telling her her name, and her brother's name, and their ages. </p>
<p>It was quite windy and she had Doug carrying her to and from the car for part of both trips. I had my Sudoku book in the car with me, and while I was sitting in the back seat with her, she practiced her numbers, telling me each one correctly. I hadn't realized she knew her numbers so it was fun being her "teacher". </p>
<p>We drove to Ocean Beach for the sand castle contest, but it was 4 P.M., the tide was coming in, and there weren't too many people on that blowy beach. I even sat in the car while Doug and Mirei got out to see if we could spend a little time there, but it was just too cold and windy. </p>
<p>On the way home, we stopped at the playground at the top of Noe Valley, and spent forty-five minutes there. I was cold, but Mirei was quite happy going down the slides, having Doug push her on the swings, and watching all the birthday children gathered there. </p>
<p>Mirei got right into the tub when we got home, I made pasta for dinner, and then we practiced catching the ball ... she's getting better and better, and is now tossing it into the air and catching it regularly, and reading on the sofa. She had gone in the living room before me, while I cleaned up the dinner dishes, and I found her sitting quietly in the corner chair waiting patiently for me. </p>
<p>It's such a pleasure to share our days with this little girl. There wasn't an unhappy moment in her day from morning until night and those smiles just keep on coming. She's such a good little companion. Mirei has her Grandpa and me grinning away, and it's obvious she enjoys entertaining us; I just can't imagine her not here with us. </p>
<p>Sound asleep at 7:35 tonight, snuggled up against me, with her nose touching mine! Such a pleasure from that first sleepy smile to that last snuggle. </p>
