								<h2>Hot, Muggy Day After the Big Storm</h2>
								<p>We woke to a very gray overcast sky but no rain, much to our surprise. It did look as though it could start up again at any time, but it didn't happen, and in fact during the afternoon it got really muggy and hot, with clear blue skies. We did set records for heaviest single-day rainfall yesterday since 1963, with over two inches falling in San Francisco, and over three along the southern coastal areas. There were lots of accidents, thousands without power throughout the Bay Area, and fallen trees and many branches landing on cars and houses. </p>
<p>I had a Hallowe'en parcel to get in the mail for Riku, and I asked Mirei if she would like to write a letter to him at the same time as I did. So of course she did that, telling him she missed him and drawing a picture for him on the back too. I also packaged up a gift for Kaitlin, and got some more sorting done in bits and pieces over the morning. Mirei kept busy with her babies, as usual, and today told me that Raggedy Ann had a dirty diaper. I grabbed the camera and took a few photos of her wiping Ann's bottom with a wipe, and by the expressions on her face during the clean-up, it wasn't the most pleasant of experiences. How funny this was to witness. One would think that there really was an odour present! </p>
<p>As I was preparing lunch, another meal of stuffed ravioli at Mirei's request (she can now open the freezer door and have a peek in there herself!), I pulled out the button box and Mirei had a grand time. Riku and Amelia both loved sorting through all the old buttons I have collected, and I have very fond memories of doing the same with my grandmother's buttons. Mirei decided to pull out all her favourite ones, the ones that didn't look so obviously like buttons ... four holes in each of them, for instance, and when it was time to put them away made me promise not to mix them up with the others. </p>
<p>This promising is a brand new behavior, just the second time I have heard her use the term. When I told her I would not put them in with the others, she made me look right at her and say "I promise I won't"! </p>
<p>Bryn had been working in the valley today from 6:30 A.M. and was due to come home at 1:30. Mirei and I had been out for a half hour on her trike, and that's when we discovered just how hot it was outside. Our house stays fairly cool, and even though it was warm inside, we weren't prepared for the change in temperature from yesterday. Mirei came in and changed into a skirt and a short-sleeved peasant-style blouse, which she told me her mommy had bought when she was "just a teeny weeny baby." Not sure if this is true, but it sure was a cute story. </p>
<p>Bryn said it was an Ocean Beach day for sure, but it was too late for that, as I know she would fall asleep on the way home for certain. Mirei was keen on going back to the playground with the moving steps near Safeway, so off we went. It was very quiet there, and very hot too, as it's a new playground with no mature trees for shade yet. Mirei went right to the steps, doing them over and over, and has really gained confidence and skill. There were two older girls working on them as well, and that just spurred her on to do it well. </p>
<p>A sweet little girl named Lila was there with her mom, and she was as interested in Mirei as Mirei was in her. Mirei was very chatty, telling Lila's mother not only her name, but how it was spelled, and where she lived, and that she had a mother and a big boy in Japan, and he was her brother and he was six, but she was three, almost four, and she misses her Nana when she is in Japan and I miss her too, but her Daddy said she would come back another day. It was hilarious to hear her fill this gal in on her life! </p>
<p>She and Lila had so much fun together, swinging side by side (which is where the conversation took place), and continuing on to the train and the sandbox too. We went to the car to get our big bag of sand toys, but it was so hot there, and I was keen to move on to the cooler playground on our hill. </p>
<p>This was much much better. There were a few children there for Mirei to play with, and especially two little girls, one a little younger and one a little older. The three of them had lots of fun, and I'm sorry I didn't get a photo of them all together. </p>
<p>We left the playground just before 5 o'clock and then it was tub time, dinner time, letter practice time with Bryn, and then tuck-in time with Bryn too. </p>
<p>Again tonight I asked her what she was to do if she woke up and I wasn't there, and once again the immediate answer, without missing a beat, was "cry." So we went over the ideal scenario once more. One day it will kick in, I'm sure. </p>
<p>Doug and I had tickets to a "conversation with Wallace Shawn", courtesy of Susan and Kevin, as a birthday gift for Doug. It was very interesting as not only is Wally Shawn a writer and director, but a very funny man as well. Some of his answers were a bit long, given that I was feeling so tired tonight, but I was glad I hadn't missed it. </p>
<p>I was pretty much "done in" when I got home, and since Bryn was still sleeping with Mirei, not surprising given his late night to sleep last night and his very early rising this morning, I decided to sleep upstairs tonight. I'm heading up for bed at 10:30, ready to relax with my book and turn the lights out soon. </p>
