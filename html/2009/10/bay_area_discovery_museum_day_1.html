								<h2>Another Bay Area Discovery Museum Day</h2>
								<p>Mirei slept for twelve solid hours last night, which meant that I got seven and a half hours' sleep despite turning out my light at midnight. As usual, Mirei woke up bright and happy, and wanted to just stay in bed talking and hiding and pretending we were going to stay in there all day. We would have breakfast, lunch, and dinner there, invite in some zoo animals — but not the elephants — and have snacks, and read lots of books, and then it got silly with deciding to go to the bathroom there too. That's our girl! </p>
<p>To our delight, it wasn't raining at all, and in fact Grandpa told us it was going to be a sunny day. We headed for the BADM at 10:15, and met up with Susan and Finn at 11 A.M. They had already done the tots' area, so we just meandered around the playground as usual, with time in the boat, and in the gravel pit, and Mirei's current favourite, the "cave", with lots of sea treasures stuck in its walls. Mirei spent quite a bit of time in the huge hollowed out tree today, and so I got a few photos in that spot. It's usually pretty busy and so hard to do this, but I even got Finn in a photo with her too. He was busy in other areas, and Mirei didn't show any interest in either the twig house or climbing the hill to ring the bell today. We'll be back, though. </p>
<p>We joined Susan and Finn for lunch indoors, though, and they headed off not much longer after that for Finn's nap in the car. Mirei was very keen to get to the arts and crafts room, and the clay and paint room, so most of the rest of our time was spent there. She loved the new clay, although it doesn't hold together as well as the usual mix, but it didn't matter to her at all. It wasn't busy in that area at all, or even throughout most of the outdoor area once a huge school group left, so there was lots of time and space today. </p>
<p>There was a découpage area set up next door in the craft room that was finishing up soon, so she was talked into going and trying that out. Of course she loved it, and worked diligently at pasting scraps of coloured paper onto a big box. I knew she would like it, and wrote down the recipe for the gluey paint they used. </p>
<p>There was to be a special "class" today at 2:15 to learn how to make GAK, a white glue, water, liquid paint, and borax soap mixture, and quite a nice crowd of little ones gathered for that. While they were waiting for it to start, many of the children, including Mirei, were stacking big empty, decorated boxes into piles and then crashing down into them. Lots of fun there! </p>
<p>And the came the demonstration. The fellow who was heading it up was just great, and all the children took turns at one aspect of the process or another: pouring the glue, pouring the water, adding the Borax, and then, best of all, mixing it all up. Some children didn't like getting the goop on their hands at all, but Mirei joined in with the other enthusiasts and had a grand ol' time. We came home with a nice sized piece of the pale orange and the special pink piece they had used to show us how it felt before they mixed up the other. This was a great success! </p>
<p>Mirei stopped to do a little chalk work on the way out, and had a fifteen-minute visit with one of the staff while drawing some pictures. The two of them were working at that for about ten minutes while I chatted with a parent about children's names, and then once I joined them, Mirei drew a sailboat complete with sails, clouds, and rain. She chatted with so many people today, always telling them her name, how old she is, how old she will be soon, and that she had a mother and a brother, who was six, and a daddy too. Her mommy's name is Mommy and her daddy's name is Daddy and her brother's name is Riku and it is spelled R I K and U. She is a people person for sure! </p>
<p>We left there later than ever before, at 3:30, but not before stopping to spin three pennies into the always-favourite collection spinner. Today she figured out to really make it last and stop it with her hand, so those three pennies were worth ten minutes of entertainment! Because it was so quiet there today, there wasn't the usual line up of children wanting to be next. </p>
<p>I was sure Mirei would fall asleep on the way home. But I had the children's tape playing, and we were singing along to that; she had some snacks and her water bottle to keep her busy as well, and she was just great. </p>
<p>Grandpa hadn't yet left for his dinner meeting tonight, and so I sat on the sofa with the paper for ten minutes while they sat at the table and played with the GAK, switching colours now and then. Mirei likes to "switch", and after Grandpa left we sat and played for a bit too. </p>
<p>It was tub time then, and Mirei asked me to sit with her in the bathroom. I told her I would have to get dinner started soon to which she replied "Nana, just sit down and relax, and keep me company, okay? Just for a little while. It's nice to relax and your back will feel better." Actually, my back has been behaving quite nicely since a few days after my acupuncture treatment, but I was happy to sit and watch her play with all the plastic animals. I have only eight more days with Mirei, and it's surprising how often she tells me that she is sad and that she will miss me, but she is sorry 'cause she has to see her mommy and her brother too in Japan, but that I will come and visit her 'cause Daddy told her that, but she is sad 'cause Grandpa is not going to come and visit her, and she thought he was going to but he changed his mind. </p>
<p>I really wish I could get one of these long conversations on tape, but I can just see the rolling of the eyes, and the antics that would appear once that camera got turned on! </p>
<p>Tonight, at dinner, Mirei asked a lot of questions about my parents, and she asked to see a picture of my daddy. And soon there was a photo of both mom and dad on the table, and Mirei had quite a little conversation with me about how she was sad that my mommy couldn't hold her and sing to her (I had told her today that if my mom were alive that she would do both these things, and even sang a song I knew my mom would have sung to her: "Here we go gathering nuts in May, nuts in May ... "). She taught it to Kelly's Brynnie when he was a little boy and no doubt to my children as well.</p>
<p>And of course she went on with how she was sad that my daddy couldn't hold her hand, and we talked about how my mom didn't like his beard so much, etc. etc. And we talked about all her cousins and aunts and uncles, and named as many of them as we could, as she put dots on a paper to represent them. We're busy around here! There is a lot of information going into that little head of Mirei's, but I don't know how much she will remember once she leaves the source of it all. </p>
<p>She has been talking quite often about my dying and even though I have reassured her that it wouldn't be for a long long time (I think I'm supposed to say "God willing" here!), it still comes up almost every day. </p>
<p>The other topic of conversation is about how many babies she will have, and about wombs and maybe she won't have a baby 'cause it hurts when it comes out. Riku is glad that he won't be having a baby so I guess the word is out that it's painful. </p>
<p>Bryn came home (from his trip to Vancouver) just as we were finishing up dinner, and Mirei went running down the stairs as fast as she could to jump into his arms the minute she opened the door! Talk about being well greeted! She got to show him the GAK too, and have some time playing with it with him, as well as chatting away about a dozen things that came to her mind. She was disappointed that he was going out, but it was bedtime anyway, and she blew kisses and waved goodbye from the window, put her two books for story time in her room and met me in the bathroom for her bedtime routine. Mirei was asleep at 7:40 tonight, and asked what our plans were for tomorrow before settling down. I think we might head out to San Jose to another children's museum as our time together is coming to a close, and there are still so many things to do!</p>
