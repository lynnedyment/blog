								<h2>A Very Quiet Day at Home</h2>
								<p>Mirei went happily off to Little Angels with her dad this morning, at 8:30, after a relaxed hour and a half at home. There was time to snuggle in bed, talk about her day, eat breakfast, and do her alphabet too. When I asked how the drop off had gone Bryn replied, "Just fine; she's taking on the world, one day at a time." Indeed! </p>
<p>Mirei had an invitation for a playground playdate after school with her old classmate Jonah, now a kindergartener, and his sister Sophie, who is Riku's age. The family had visited in Japan for just one day during the summer, but even without much contact with them, Mirei was fine being picked up at 3 P.M. by the dad. She had voiced some trepidation yesterday afternoon, and told me she wanted me to come too, but there wasn't any hesitation at all when it all took place. We weren't surprised, although I wondered how tired she would be after such a busy day. </p>
<p>I stayed home today, and plowed through lots of work around the kitchen mostly, cleaning, purging, sorting, making a couple of important phone calls, and getting things ready to mail. I did the laundry too, and a little tidying up in that room as well. Emails were written, and a huge number of photos from yesterday gone through. I expected to accomplish more than I did, but am still pleased with what I did do. </p>
<p>Caillie had a fever of 103ÂºF yesterday, and so was home today from school. I called her about 2 o'clock her time and we had a nice long talk. She has decided on a Hallowe'en costume, a "goth" ballerina, I believe, and she filled me in on what has been going on in her life. Caillie has been looking at the photos of Mirei on Facebook and so wishes she were here to play with her, and spend time with her. One day, perhaps ... </p>
<p>At 4:30, Doug and I met Sophie's and Jonah's dad at the big playground in Golden Gate park. We hadn't been there this trip, although mostly, I was told, Mirei played in the sand box with Sophie, which is where they were when we met up with them, but apparently she had played with Jonah for a little bit at first. We said goodbye fairly quickly with perhaps ten minutes letting Mirei finish up with Sophie, and then we got them together for a group shot. </p>
<p>Mirei had a good day, she told us, but it turned out she hadn't eaten much at all. I gave her a snack of her uneaten grapes and strawberries, which she wolfed down, and then fed her pistachios after that. She went right into the tub while I made homemade mac' and cheese from scratch on the stove top, and added some leftover sweet potato mash into it. It made it a lovely golden yellow colour, and gave Mirei an extra vegetable too, one she said she didn't like the other night. My guess is that it was the texture, but it smoothed out beautifully in the cheese sauce. Lots of broccoli and corn, and playing with some letters and numbers halfway through dinner had our cheerful girl back. She said she was playing "creep along" at school and that was why she didn't eat her lunch. Hmm-m-m. Unusual for her not to eat well. </p>
<p>Mirei chose three books tonight, two of them very short, very easy ones, and one was a Shel Silverstein book, called "The Giving Tree", a book that generated lots of questions and puzzled looks from Mirei. She wondered why that boy didn't want to visit the tree anymore, etc., etc. </p>
<p>That's it for today ... and so very few photos of Mirei for this entry! </p>
