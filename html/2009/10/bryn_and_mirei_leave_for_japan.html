								<h2>Bryn and Mirei Leave for Japan</h2>
								<p>Mirei has been keeping track of how many days she had left in San Francisco, and so I wasn't surprised when she awoke this morning and told me she was sorry, but that she was going back to Japan today. Their flight was at 11:30, so we had time, thank goodness, for our usual cuddles and giggles in bed. </p>
<p>It was a very quiet and organized last few hours together, as Bryn only had to pack up everything that had been laid out on the bed the night before. He was relieved when I reminded him that he had one more bag to pack in, as I had given him some birthday/Christmas books for the children, and his one big bag was already packed to the brim with the two skateboards he bought here ... one for himself and one for Riku. He was taking back a big block of cheddar cheese too, and a double package of Mirei's favourite pasta here, a cheese stuffed tortellini. That extra bag sure came in handy! </p>
<p>Mirei had time for one of her very favourite activities, making another cherry pie with Play-Doh. She is getting an "A" for crimping, as she handles the fork just perfectly for this job.  While the end of the packing took place, we watched a Caillou DVD together, and she had a big bowl of porridge too. </p>
<p>During the last fifteen minutes I made up a snack pack for Mirei mostly, with an egg and "bacon" omelet, grapes and orange sections, a few treats, and tucked in a new book for her too,  "The Saggy Baggy Elephant". She's a good little traveller and I know it will be a good trip for them both. </p>
<p>Bryn suggested we drop them off at the airport but I wanted to stay with Mirei through the checking-in procedure, and I was glad we did. It all took a while and she and I were able to have some extra time together. We all waved many many times while they went through to the security line, and then one last wave before they disappeared on us. </p>
<p>The house was very very quiet and I immediately started pulling sheets off the beds, and keeping busy. There is so much to do before I leave for Japan in just eleven days, and I sat down and added to the long list of things to do before I am on that plane for eleven hours. The rest of the day flew by for me, but I took time to sit and go through some magazines; they have been stacking up faster than I could read them, and Doug and I watched one of our rented movies that have also been collecting. My mind kept going to that plane, and as the hours went by I wondered what Mirei was doing to keep busy, whether she and her dad were sleeping, and how excited they would be to get home again. </p>
