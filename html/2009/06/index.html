								<h2><a href="/2009/06/a_morning_with_finn.html">Monday Morning with Finn ... and Tulips Plus</a></h2>
								<p>It has been a long time since Finn was here with me, more than two months! I was looking forward to having him putter about the house again, and Susan was happy to go off for groceries and run errands while he played at Nana and Grandpa's house. He came in wearing a Toronto Maple Leafs zip-up jacket, which he refused to take off, and the cutest little flattish driving cap with a brim, looking quite Irish to me. I must get a photo of him in it! </p>
<p>Finn has a little cold and is jet-lagged, and since it was foggy and chilly outside, we spent all of the two-plus hours in the house today, rare for us. But, Finn was very happy wandering about. There were baskets of toys to empty, dolls to walk in their stroller, balls to roll, dishes to empty onto the floor from the little play stove, drawers to empty of their plastic utensils, push toys to push, sweeping to be done, and more quiet time sitting on the floor in the small bedroom, playing with the basket full of cars. </p>
<p>I was in the kitchen while he was in there, and every once in a while he would call out to me "Nana, I am in here!" and I would thank him for telling me. I went in at one point to ask him if he would like porridge; he merely nodded his head, engrossed with the cars. Then I asked if he wanted strawberries in it, and he nodded again. So, I asked if he would like blueberries too, and he shook his head no. Doug put him in his seat at the table for me, and he ate every single bite of it! </p>
<p>Finn is asking lots of questions ... "What this do?", "What this for?" He is speaking so well and repeats anything I don't catch for me until I do understand. We sang too, with Raffi on in the background. Finn likes to dance, and once in a while stops to move to the beat. Adorable! </p>
<p>Susan came in, bearing, as always, some wonderful treats: fresh hot tamales, and Belgian chocolate pudding, one of Doug's favourite desserts of late! Susan had given us some before they left for Toronto and Doug was one happy camper. He mentioned to her how much he liked it, Susan remembered, of course, and now there is a whole tub of it for us to share. Yum! And there was a lovely bouquet of bright yellow tulips for me too. </p>
<p>Finn waved from the car window, after a nice little kiss goodbye. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/06/a_morning_surprise_from_susan.html">Finn and a Gardener Arrive!</a></h2>
								<p>I had asked Susan on Monday if Finn could visit again today, and called this morning to make sure he would be here. The answer was "yes", but Susan said she would be here too, to plant my flower pots at the front of the house! They were in a dreadful state, with completely dead flowers in one pot, weeds poking out from around a geranium in another, and a couple of empty pots as well. What a gal! I was delighted, and handed over the basket of gardening tools to her. </p>
<p>It's a gorgeous sunny warm day today, and Finn wanted to go into the garden with me. So, off we went, brooms in hand, and worked away. If I swept the deck, then so did Finn. When I moved on to the brick patio, Finn was right beside me. And when I reached up to the windows to knock down the dried up spider webs, Finn tried his best to do the same. We got a lot done, the two of us! </p>
<p>Miraculously, it seemed to me, I woke this morning with no pain, and no need to eat immediately so that I could take a Motrin! I didn't do any bending, but Finn was happy to pick up the big sticks to put in the city compost bin, and to try to pull some weeds too. Susan, finished at the front, and pulled a few weeds in the garden, before coming into the house with Finn. I had made him a poached egg and toast, but he wasn't interested in anything but the grapes and strawberries we popped into him. </p>
<p>He had discovered the big noisy Tonka truck today, and sat figuring out how all the bits work. "What this do?", over and over he asked, as there were lots of buttons! It's a noisy machine, and Amelia didn't like it one bit, always covering her ears when Riku was playing with it. But the noise doesn't bother Finn at all. He was reluctant to leave, so I told him he could take it home with him. This pleased him no end! </p>
<p>I admired my newly-filled flower pots and promised Susan I would pick up the extra few I need to fill them in. Finn turned back on their way to their car and said something to me ... Susan said he had said "I love you Nana." Music to my ears! I love him too, and stood waving goodbye as they drove by the house. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/06/sealed_with_a_kiss_really.html">Sealed With a Kiss... Really!</a></h2>
								<p>Just before I went to Japan, Caillie had written to me, suggesting that we start writing letters, not emails, to each other again. We had done so off and on over the past few years, but less so the past two years, so it's time for sure to get back to this. </p>
<p>I had a letter from her waiting for me when I arrived home two weeks ago, wrote back to her, and today received another from her. It was such fun to read her very enthusiastic letter with lots of detail about how she has been spending her days. So, the ball is rolling and it makes me very happy. I'll be sitting with pen in hand tonight. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/06/caillies_new_hair_cut.html">Caillie's New Hair Cut!</a></h2>
								<p>Kelly surprised us with this photo of Caillie today, and it caught us all by surprise ... Doug, me, my sisters, and friends. What a difference bangs have made in her look! Caillie has always had the most beautiful hair, thick, with lots of natural highlights, and she often puts it up with ribbons or ties, or looped up in various styles. It always looked lovely. But, the bangs she had cut today just make our "little" girl look like a maturing young lady! I kept looking and looking at the photo, over and over today, not quite believing that such a small change could make a big difference. I think Caillie has been quite taken aback by all the attention this cut has given her, but she'll get used to it, I'm sure! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/06/san_francisco_to_prince_edward.html">San Francisco to Prince Edward Island via Halifax</a></h2>
								<p>Last night, at 10 P.M. our neighbour Karyn drove us to the airport for our flight at 12:30. We were there in lots of time, and then we sat, and sat, and sat as our plane had been delayed en route to San Francisco. An hour and five minutes later it was clear we weren't going to make our connection in Washington for our direct flight to Halifax. There is only one of those flights a day, so once we arrived in Washington, six minutes after our flight left, we made arrangements for the next best situation, which meant a three and a half hour wait before our plane left for Ottawa. </p>
<p>I was more than ready for a late breakfast and a big hot cup of tea; Doug found hot egg and cheese panini sandwiches, and I enjoyed the largest cup of Starbucks tea they have. We read and did a crossword puzzle together and the time flew by. </p>
<p>It was only a one-hour flight to Ottawa, and even though we didn't manage to get seats together on that flight, we lucked out once we arrived there, as Doug noticed a flight leaving in twenty minutes, an hour and forty minutes earlier than the one we were booked on. With just a carry-on each, we dashed to the gate and managed to get seats on that flight. This saved us two hours of sitting at yet another airport, and we landed in Halifax at 5:30 P.M. </p>
<p>But we had more obstacles ahead of us. Doug had arranged to pick up a car in downtown Halifax, with a shuttle bus planned for the trip into the city. We found out the shuttle wasn't going for another hour and a half, and even if it had left immediately, the rental place closed at 6 P.M. There was a half hour of frustration trying to sort all of this out, but we finally realized we had no choice but to rent the car from the airport, biting the bullet and paying the extra $130 for the rental from there. </p>
<p>And then our long day became brighter. We had a lovely young man helping us, and not only did we end up with a brand new compact Volvo, that had only been rented out once before us, he charged us the city rate as well! He really made our day, as it meant we could head right out for PEI from the airport, saving us the time getting in and out of the city. </p>
<p>We stopped at a Subway sandwich spot for a very light dinner, and the friendly young woman there gave us an extra scoop of tuna after I asked for it, and didn't charge us for it. I was hungry! Doug celebrated his official arrival in Canada with a Bostom Creme doughnut from the Tim Horton's next door!</p>
<p>We were anxious to get to our motel, and enjoyed the lovely green scenery all along the way. We went through a corner of New Brunswick on our way to the new (since 1999) Confederation Bridge. PEI is <strong>green</strong> and just lovely. It reminded me in some ways of Ireland with all the different colours of green, but it is flatter. </p>
<p>We passed big plots of red dirt fields, ready for planting, and it was lovely that it stayed light so late, as we were able to take it all in before reaching our motel at 9 P.M., almost four hours later than we had hoped to be there. </p>
<p>Doug had found this spot for us over the Internet just a few days ago, and we were sold on the place when the fellow who owns it had printed on his Web site that he preferred phone calls for bookings, rather than online reservations, as he talked better than he typed. It's a family-run motel, beautifully maintained, with the previous owners, the parents of the new owners, still helping out. </p>
<p>We unpacked, checked our emails, and got to bed at midnight. Lovely to be here! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/06/summerside_to_north_cape_light_1.html">Summerside to North Cape Lighthouse and Return</a></h2>
								<p>I woke at 9 A.M. today (!) to the sound of Doug showering; what a good long deep sleep I had! The motel owners serve a continental breakfast in their lounge during off season and today is the last day for it. We were hungry, and ready to get started on our tour of the island, so I popped in and out of shower as quickly as possible, and we headed off in the drizzle for a bite to eat. We were so glad we did, as we met a lovely couple from Edmonton, and a gal from Kelowna, and sat chatting as we ate yogurt and delicious muffins, with juice and/or tea. No one was in a big rush, since the rain got heavier, so there was time to listen to what the others had done and seen and recommended. </p>
<p>By 11 A.M. we were out the door, with our eventual goal being the North Cape lighthouse at the northwestern end of this piece of the island. We didn't get far before stopping though! Our motto when in small towns is "never pass up a new bakery", and there was one about a three-minute drive from the motel. We were somewhat disappointed in this first one, though, as there was nothing especially enticing to me, although Doug found some fruit scones that he will eat for breakfast and afternoon snacks when he is peckish. </p>
<p>We got back in the car, heading up the western portion of the island, following the North Cape Coastal Drive. There were decorated road signs that pointed the way for us, but we found them very confusing. At one point, we ended up too far east, and headed back to the road we should have stayed on. But we got lost a second time, and turned around when we hit the very end of a road that turned to dirt, ending at Egmont Bay, not where we wanted to be! Back on the main road once more, we figured out where we were going wrong.</p>
<p>So, here's the deal. Yes, they post signs, lovely colourful signs, telling you your turn is coming up. Then that's it! They don't have a sign at the actual turning point, and we found out that what we were expected to do was quickly look down the roads to our right or left to see if we could spot the continuation sign! Sometimes it would be the first road, just yards ahead, but other times it's a couple of roads down. It's sort of like a treasure hunt, and we felt pretty darned good after that, having figured out how the game worked. </p>
<p>It was raining gently, and then less gently as we drove on, but it was fun passing signs along the way for Alaska, Brooklyn, and Norway, all place names here. Sandy had told us about a good spot for lunch along that road, and it was easy to spot the big sign at the "G & E" restaurant in Unionvale. The place was huge, almost empty, and dark, and obviously a spot the locals like, as there was one table full of people the waitress seemed to know. Doug had his very first lobster roll, something he was looking forward to, and I had a grilled cheese sandwich with pickles. </p>
<p>Our next stop was at O'Leary, home of the Potato Museum, Interpretive Centre, and Community Museum, all rolled into one. We enjoyed it so much more than we thought we would. It is very well put together, with lots of photos and documentation for all the facts. Something we didn't know was that Russians grow the most potatoes in the world (but not for french fries!), China is next, with half that amount, and Canada is last on the list! Even the Brits grow more potatoes that we do. </p>
<p>There was a room full of period furniture, which I especially enjoyed. I took my time wandering about, looking at the old baby buggies, cribs, antique quilts, china, beds, chairs, etc. and even found the name of a Dyment — Curtis, out of Springfield — in a book of local boys who had served in WWI. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Doug was exploring and spent a lot of time checking out the first iron lung he has ever seen. At one point the local doctor had owned one, and a replica of his office had been constructed there as well. </p>
<p>A few years ago, through my Ancestry website, a PEI Dyment had contacted me via email to see if Doug was from that same family of two brothers who left Somerset, England, in 1833, bound for Canada. Doug's ancestor, John, and his wife Mary, went to Dundas in Ontario, and his brother Humphrey, with his wife Elizabeth, left to farm in PEI. A week before we left on this trip, I emailed Bayfield Dyment, and told him we would be in the area. He kindly wrote back, suggesting we meet, and since he works at the Home Hardware store in O'Leary, we decided to connect there on our first day. </p>
<p>He was gracious and very friendly, and we stood in the back room chatting with him for a while. Curtis Dyment, the fellow named in the museum book, was his grandfather, and served in both world wars. We planned to get together again later in the week. </p>
<p>From O'Leary we headed northwest up Hwy. 2. It was just pouring by that time, and the windshield wipers were having a hard time keeping up with the it all. However, the island is green, green, green, and so very beautiful. I wanted to take photos but it was just too wet, so we just had to admire what we could from the windows of the car. The red soil, ready for planting, is such a contrast from the green fields, and it all looked just grand ... all countryside, with tiny little villages along the way. There are only two cities in PEI — Charlottetown, and Summerside — and Doug feels that the latter should probably be called a large town. </p>
<p>We arrived at North Cape lighthouse in a downpour! There were a couple of tall white wind generators off the side of the road as we drove up to it, and they looked quite ghostly in the heavy fog. We couldn't even walk along the short path to the lighthouse as we would have been drenched, and muddy to boot! We stopped in at the information building, alone with just one clerk, and after Doug managed to snap a couple of photos, from the protection of the porch, we headed home again. </p>
<p>We didn't loiter on the way home, but headed right into Summerside for dinner at "Eva's", a spot recommended to us by the owner of the motel. We lucked out, as it was Friday night and they had a fish and chip special on. The menu was quite limited for me, but the fish (haddock) was delicious, if heavily battered, while Doug chose scallops and chips. We also had a choice of soup, juice, or rainbow cake with it. Doug had a bowl of seafood chowder, which he quite enjoyed, and I had tomato juice. </p>
<p>We stopped at the nearby grocery store for grapes and bananas, but had to carefully dodge the deep puddles. The lone clerk called out "You made it!" to everyone entering the store. Some of the nearby streets at the lower end of town, were flooded with inches of water.</p>
<p>Happy to be back in our cozy room, we were all set for some computer time, but there were problems with software updates being downloaded, and that didn't get finished up until after 11 P.M., bedtime for both of us. We're hoping for a dry day tomorrow!  </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/06/central_pei_from_sunnyside_to.html">Central PEI: From Sunnyside, to Anne of Green Gables Country, to Charlottetown, and "Home"</a></h2>
								<p>Doug woke me this morning at 7:30 to get started on our day, a sunny one! We had some fruit in our room, and Doug added one of his fruit scones to his meal. And we were off for a road tour of the central part of this beautiful island. </p>
<p>We headed due east today, with me snapping photos left, right, and centre, often from the car windows, as the lush green well-tended plots of land just amaze me. All the fields seem to be unplanted as yet, despite lovely warm days; the soil is so red, and there isn't a rock in sight.We were constantly astounded at what perfect lawns people maintain here; weeds are obviously just not allowed. </p>
<p>Everyone seems to have a huge parcel of land, even when the homes are quite modest, but for the most part the homes are really big, wooden or aluminum siding, and always well maintained.It was picture perfect all the way up to the northern coast, where we drove as close to the water as the road took us. </p>
<p>We would have liked to take a peek at Lucy Montgomery's home (aka Anne of Green Gables home), but we weren't interested in going on the tour, and so we will wait until the next time we visit there — we hope to do so! — and walk around the grounds after closing time as one of the couples from the motel suggested yesterday. Instead we drove through a Provincial Park, and unknowingly drove close by the spot where Sandy and her family have rented a cottage for many years. </p>
<p>North Rustico is a very pretty town with a harbour, and we parked the car and went for a walk along the boardwalk; there were sculptures with explanations about the ancient Indian tribes who lived there over 3,000 years ago, as well as sea life and bird sculptures. We took lots of photos of the picturesque wooden sheds beside the harbour and meandered about looking at the boats. </p>
<p>Sandy had told us about one of her favourite places to eat, so we headed south for the PEI Preserve Company for lunch at their "Cafe on the Clyde". It was a busy spot, but we were lucky enough to get a window seat beside the red-coloured Clyde River. Doug had a PEI lobster quiche with a garden salad, and I had Maritime fish cakes (haddock, onions, and potatoes) with a Caesar salad. Sandy had suggested that we save room for the raspberry cream cheese pie, which we did, and I enjoyed a full pot of tea with it too. Yum! </p>
<p>We headed for Charlottetown after taking some photos outside the restaurant in their lovely garden, but stopped first at the Cow Creamery, a huge, local (to the Martimes), and very busy ice cream shop. Reader's Digest voted them as having the best ice cream in Canada. I was too full for a scoop, but had a taste of Doug's. From there we drove down to the harbour area of Charlottetown and walked around snapping a few photos of the older wooden homes there, and peeking into a few of the touristy shops.</p>
<p>We drove home slowly, stopping to take a few scenic photos, including some of an old Canoe Cove school built in 1830.</p>
<p>I think Sandy had told us there was a good spot for lobster rolls in Summerside called "Sharky's"; we had passed by it on our way out of town this morning, so that was our dinner destination tonight. We arrived at 6:30, and it was a good thing, since they close up at 7 P.M., as most places do in this area! We were astounded at this, but it wasn't at all busy, and we were the last customers in the place. I had fish and chips, better than the ones at Eva's last night, and Doug thoroughly enjoyed his very generously filled lobster roll. </p>
<p>Home for emails, reading, and relaxing. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/06/cemeteries_and_kin.html">Cemeteries and Kinfolk</a></h2>
								<p>We had another lovely day for our Sunday drive into the country, checking out local cemeteries for the PEI Dyment family, and then on for a longer visit with Bayfield Dyment, whom we met briefly the other day. Today we drove along the shoreline of Malpeque Bay to Tyne Valley and the village of Bideford. This is an area where many of the original Dyments settled. </p>
<p>Just a very brief Dyment family history lesson here: in 1833, two Dyment brothers, John and Humphrey, left the family farm in Somerset and made their way to Canada on board the "Collina". Both had wives and children with them. John (from whom Doug is descended) made his way to Dundas, Ontario, and Humphrey went to PEI and settled in there. </p>
<p>So, today our mission was to photograph the headstones for that original Dyment couple and as many others as we could find. Our first stop was the United Church cemetery in Bideford, where Bayfield had told us to start our search. There was a service going on at the lovely little white church, so we quietly moved about taking photographs. It was quite an experience for Doug, as he has never seen so many Dyment names in one place. When he lived in New York City, he was the only Dyment listed in the phone book, and yet in this small province, with a population less than one third the size of San Francisco, there were over twenty-five names listed (and Bayfield told us they don't all put their names in the phone book)! </p>
<p>We were just finishing up when the church services ended, and immediately a man approached Doug, asking if he could help him find anyone in particular. His father, it turned out, is the custodian of the church grounds, and he kindly gave us his own email address, so if there were any questions we could write and ask. This is going to come in very handy, as it turned out that not all the stones were as easily read as we hoped, so no doubt there will be emails going back and forth. </p>
<p>We were certainly getting lots of attention from the mostly elderly patrons of the church, as an older fellow stopped for a chat with us as well. He too came from a family that settled in Bideford, about five years before Humphrey and Mary arrived. We left when there was just one car in the lot, but before doing so Doug chatted with the two elderly women waiting in the car, telling them why we were there. What a shame he hadn't spoken with them first, as a female Dyment had been at the service and had just left! They gave us directions to her home, but we were heading in the opposite direction to Bayfield's home. Everyone is so very friendly here, and we felt welcome everywhere we went. </p>
<p>We drove to Unionvale and returned to the G&E Restaurant we had eaten in our first day, but this time went to the café part instead, as we were in a bit of a dash to get to Bayfield's. Doug got his lobster roll, and I had a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich. I love these little spots where you can order something not on the menu and it's just fine. </p>
<p>On to Milburn to meet Bayfield's family ... his partner Darlene, and their thirteen-year-old son Nason. What a lovely family this is! We felt like family immediately, and settled in for a two-hour visit with them. I had tea. We talked about all that we had done, and the local Dyments. We went over all the names I had written down from the phone book and they filled me in on who they knew personally, and who they knew by family connections only. </p>
<p>Nason is just a charming young man. Much to our surprise, instead of saying hello and then vacating himself to his room, he sat and made conversation with us, told us about his life there, and seemed very comfortable chatting with us. I thought how different his life is compared to those of the children in Toronto. He has to be driven from his home in the country everywhere he goes, and he gets picked up for school on a school bus. However, he is happy about getting a high speed internet connection this summer, moreso than either of his parents, I think! </p>
<p>When we left, Darlene gave us two canning jars with clams in one, and lobster chunks in the other. Bayfield had made up a very well put together folder filled with the Dyment family history from before the Dyment boys left England in 1833 to the present day. He also gifted us with an old PEI grade school history book that provides a concise description of the island's development. It was a lovely visit and we will certainly be keeping in touch with them.</p>
<p>Our next stop was the West Point lighthouse, which had been brought to our attention by Doug's sister Sandy a few years back. She had done the tour there at the time, and much to her surprise found out that the first family who ran the lighthouse was a Mariah Dyment and her husband William "Willie" MacDonald. They ran it for fifty years, from 1875-1925. They owned a farm some ways back from the lighthouse, and raised a large family there, but Willie would go to the lighthouse each evening before dusk, and stay there all night, and many evenings they entertained neighbours there, with Mariah playing the parlour piano she had moved there within a year of taking up their new duties. They had a lovely view of the beach from the top floor of the lighthouse and many photographs and details of their lives are written up and displayed on the walls. It was very exciting to see this for ourselves, and Doug even bought a t-shirt — a rare event! — with the West Point Lighthouse insignia on it. I did have to do a little coaxing though. </p>
<p>This is the only lighthouse on PEI that is painted black and white; it was changed from the original red and white when it was discovered that the red colour (which also fades quickly) was less visible at sea. </p>
<p>Bay, as Bayfield is called informally, had given us directions to another cemetery where his parents, and many other Dyments are buried, so that was our next stop. We drove back to O'Leary, and southwest towards Knutsford for longer than we had expected it to be, but finally found the United cemetery (actually associated with the church back in O'Leary), and sure enough there were lots of Dyment stones there, and we took many more photos. </p>
<p>We were sure this was not the one he meant, though, so back we drove to O'Leary where the friendly gal at the corner store let me use the phone to call Bay for more directions. Off we went again, down that same road, but much further along towards Springfield West (almost back to the West Point lighthouse). We found it, now a Baptist Cemetery, but many years ago a United Church burial ground. There were more Dyment headstones to photograph, and at some point we hope to return for further research. It will take me a long time to enter this side of the family into the family tree, though! </p>
<p>We were hungry and tired by the time we finished up our trip here, but it was late enough that not too much was open except the fast food places, not our favourite spots. We did drive into Summerside to confirm that the restaurants were closed, and ended up at a Pizza Delight. By this time pizza sounded really good, and we enjoyed it. They have what apparently is quite common in PEI and Nova Scotia, a bread grill bar, something Susan had told us about. Doug didn't try it but I put a flat piece of whole wheat bun on a grill, "buttered" it with two different spreads, and then let it got hot and melty. Yum! And just what I needed before half a pizza too! </p>
<p>We had a very friendly hostess who suggested a favourite fishing village of hers on our day trip tomorrow. </p>
<p>Home at 8:30, tired and very happy after such a busy, productive but relaxing day. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/06/a_lazy_day_and_a_surprise_visi.html">A Lazy Day, and a Surprise Visit and Phone Call Too!</a></h2>
								<p>I turned out my light last night after reading for an hour, at 5 A.M. body time, so it was guaranteed that today was going to be a very relaxed one for me. It was. I unpacked my one bag, got a load of laundry started, worked on a Sudoku puzzle with Doug over lunch, wrote some emails, and did a little family tree work. Ahhhh! </p>
<p>Then came a welcome call from Jackie Williams, mother of Brent (a good friend of Bryn's), and cousin to my cousin's husband (a relationship we had discovered by accident a few years back). Since connecting back then, Jackie and I try to see each other whenever she is in town visiting her darling little grandson Quentin, son of Michela and Brent. </p>
<p>They stopped by for tea and a visit, bringing along some milk and lovely pastries as well. Quentin quite enjoyed the apple bran muffin I put out, and that gave him lots of energy for exploring. He was busy with the stroller and two "babies", found a drawer just his size to open and shut, played with the cars and trucks he had discovered in March, when he was last here, and generally had a grand time entertaining the three women smitten with him. </p>
<p>He's a dolly, with big brown eyes, a dimple in his right cheek, and sweet smiles. He turned one not long ago, and is a confident and able walker. Such fun to see him snuggling with his Grandma while his mom beamed at him at every turn. </p>
<p>I had another surprise too today, enjoying a chat with Riku via Skype. What a treat to talk to him, hear his voice, see his face, and catch up a little bit on his day. (Mirei was still at school.) </p>
<p>I snapped a few photos while we were talking, and even though the photos are not a very high quality, I am happy to be able to capture them this way. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/06/happy_birthday_to_gail_and_gle.html">Happy Birthday to Gail and Glenn, the "Womb-Mates"</a></h2>
								<p>It was another quiet day around here, but not so for Gail and Glenn, who turned 62. Glenn celebrated in Niagara Falls, with a buffet lunch out with Wendy, Becky, and Wayne. Gail should have celebrated first, actually, as she <strong>is</strong> a half hour older!</p>
<p>Gail and Tom were going out to the Keg for dinner at five, and so Gail opened her gifts this afternoon. I phoned just after she finished up, so got to hear about all the wonderful books, music, teas, and body lotions she received from Tom. </p>
<p>I am sure both siblings talked to the others siblings at some point during the day. We do try to do this, and I was lucky enough to find them both at home and the phone not busy!  This way, Doug and I sang "Happy Birthday" together over the phone, and no one had to hear my not-in-tune rendition on their answering machine. </p>
<p>Bryn had put together a video of the children singing "Happy Birthday" to Auntie Gail and Uncle Glenn, but on version number one, they both sang the names of the recipients at different times and/or sang "Auntie Glenn" and "Uncle Gail" ... not sure which, so he did two takes. Both are adorable, as they put all their enthusiasm into them, but how Doug and I howled when we heard Mirei do an enthusiastic flourish at the end of the second one. What a card she is! </p>
<p>Speaking of cards, Riku made a lovely card and envelope for Auntie Gail's birthday some time ago, here in San Francisco, and I had put it away until it was time to send it off to her. I took photos of them, of course(!), so I could save his "art" along with his other pieces. And it goes without saying that Auntie Gail was as thrilled with her card as Auntie Candy was with hers in February. I wish I had thought to have him make one for his Auntie Beth when I was in Japan, but those last ten days were not what they should have been. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/06/the_gardening_crew_arrives.html">The Gardening Crew Arrives!</a></h2>
								<p>My garden has been sorely neglected for too long. There was a time, a <strong>long</strong> time ago, when it was quite pristine with newly planted annuals, carefully watered all through the summer, and nary a weed in sight. Once the grandchildren arrived, it was fun and easy to go out and weed while they played, found bugs, "helped" me sweep, and move the debris about. Eventually, though, the more diligent gardening was replaced with playgrounds and adventures away from the house. So, over the past couple of years especially, it has just been swept up, kept somewhat tidy, and as a result, slowly but surely, the more persistent weeds took over. </p>
<p>Susan loves to garden, and over the years has come by and spent full mornings out there with the children and me tidying it up. Once I was back from Japan in May with my "bad" back, and unable to do a thing out there — no bending, no stretching, no leaning, made it impossible to get at the three-foot(!) weeds in one area — Susan took it upon herself to get it back in order. It really was a jungle out there, after six weeks in Japan, and busy rainy wintry months before that. </p>
<p>Susan knew how much it bothered me to see it in such tough shape. So, not only did she do a lot of clipping and weed pulling when I first got home, planting flower pots for me at the front of the house, she also came over with Finn while I was in PEI to add to the flower pots, and do some more work with Finn. How did I get so lucky? </p>
<p>Today I suggested she drop both children off in the morning with me, and head out for some quiet and alone time, but instead she thought it would be fun to garden with us. My back is now almost back to normal, and so the four of us spent over an hour and a half sweeping, breaking branches to fit into the city composting bucket, and weeding and clipping. Susan did the back-breaking pulling of the thickest weeds and clipping off the tough branches, but the children kept at it the entire time with us too. They have their own gardening gloves here, and Amelia was thrilled to be allowed to use the adult snippers. Finn was not pleased about his safety children's scissors but he resigned himself to his fate. Now I have a full composting container, well compressed, after Doug stood in it, tromping it all down, and there is another huge mound waiting for next week's pick-up.  </p>
<p>And, as if this weren't enough, Susan insisted on bringing lunch in for us! The children and I went upstairs and played until Susan called us down for big yummy sandwiches, and a box full of the most wonderful desserts: a perfect lemon slice, the chewiest, most luscious brownies, and some blondies too, yet to be savoured. What a perfect three hours this was! Thank you Susan! </p>
