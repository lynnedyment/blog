								<h2>San Francisco to Prince Edward Island via Halifax</h2>
								<p>Last night, at 10 P.M. our neighbour Karyn drove us to the airport for our flight at 12:30. We were there in lots of time, and then we sat, and sat, and sat as our plane had been delayed en route to San Francisco. An hour and five minutes later it was clear we weren't going to make our connection in Washington for our direct flight to Halifax. There is only one of those flights a day, so once we arrived in Washington, six minutes after our flight left, we made arrangements for the next best situation, which meant a three and a half hour wait before our plane left for Ottawa. </p>
<p>I was more than ready for a late breakfast and a big hot cup of tea; Doug found hot egg and cheese panini sandwiches, and I enjoyed the largest cup of Starbucks tea they have. We read and did a crossword puzzle together and the time flew by. </p>
<p>It was only a one-hour flight to Ottawa, and even though we didn't manage to get seats together on that flight, we lucked out once we arrived there, as Doug noticed a flight leaving in twenty minutes, an hour and forty minutes earlier than the one we were booked on. With just a carry-on each, we dashed to the gate and managed to get seats on that flight. This saved us two hours of sitting at yet another airport, and we landed in Halifax at 5:30 P.M. </p>
<p>But we had more obstacles ahead of us. Doug had arranged to pick up a car in downtown Halifax, with a shuttle bus planned for the trip into the city. We found out the shuttle wasn't going for another hour and a half, and even if it had left immediately, the rental place closed at 6 P.M. There was a half hour of frustration trying to sort all of this out, but we finally realized we had no choice but to rent the car from the airport, biting the bullet and paying the extra $130 for the rental from there. </p>
<p>And then our long day became brighter. We had a lovely young man helping us, and not only did we end up with a brand new compact Volvo, that had only been rented out once before us, he charged us the city rate as well! He really made our day, as it meant we could head right out for PEI from the airport, saving us the time getting in and out of the city. </p>
<p>We stopped at a Subway sandwich spot for a very light dinner, and the friendly young woman there gave us an extra scoop of tuna after I asked for it, and didn't charge us for it. I was hungry! Doug celebrated his official arrival in Canada with a Bostom Creme doughnut from the Tim Horton's next door!</p>
<p>We were anxious to get to our motel, and enjoyed the lovely green scenery all along the way. We went through a corner of New Brunswick on our way to the new (since 1999) Confederation Bridge. PEI is <strong>green</strong> and just lovely. It reminded me in some ways of Ireland with all the different colours of green, but it is flatter. </p>
<p>We passed big plots of red dirt fields, ready for planting, and it was lovely that it stayed light so late, as we were able to take it all in before reaching our motel at 9 P.M., almost four hours later than we had hoped to be there. </p>
<p>Doug had found this spot for us over the Internet just a few days ago, and we were sold on the place when the fellow who owns it had printed on his Web site that he preferred phone calls for bookings, rather than online reservations, as he talked better than he typed. It's a family-run motel, beautifully maintained, with the previous owners, the parents of the new owners, still helping out. </p>
<p>We unpacked, checked our emails, and got to bed at midnight. Lovely to be here! </p>
