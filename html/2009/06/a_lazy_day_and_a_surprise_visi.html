								<h2>A Lazy Day, and a Surprise Visit and Phone Call Too!</h2>
								<p>I turned out my light last night after reading for an hour, at 5 A.M. body time, so it was guaranteed that today was going to be a very relaxed one for me. It was. I unpacked my one bag, got a load of laundry started, worked on a Sudoku puzzle with Doug over lunch, wrote some emails, and did a little family tree work. Ahhhh! </p>
<p>Then came a welcome call from Jackie Williams, mother of Brent (a good friend of Bryn's), and cousin to my cousin's husband (a relationship we had discovered by accident a few years back). Since connecting back then, Jackie and I try to see each other whenever she is in town visiting her darling little grandson Quentin, son of Michela and Brent. </p>
<p>They stopped by for tea and a visit, bringing along some milk and lovely pastries as well. Quentin quite enjoyed the apple bran muffin I put out, and that gave him lots of energy for exploring. He was busy with the stroller and two "babies", found a drawer just his size to open and shut, played with the cars and trucks he had discovered in March, when he was last here, and generally had a grand time entertaining the three women smitten with him. </p>
<p>He's a dolly, with big brown eyes, a dimple in his right cheek, and sweet smiles. He turned one not long ago, and is a confident and able walker. Such fun to see him snuggling with his Grandma while his mom beamed at him at every turn. </p>
<p>I had another surprise too today, enjoying a chat with Riku via Skype. What a treat to talk to him, hear his voice, see his face, and catch up a little bit on his day. (Mirei was still at school.) </p>
<p>I snapped a few photos while we were talking, and even though the photos are not a very high quality, I am happy to be able to capture them this way. </p>
