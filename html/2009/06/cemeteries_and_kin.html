								<h2>Cemeteries and Kinfolk</h2>
								<p>We had another lovely day for our Sunday drive into the country, checking out local cemeteries for the PEI Dyment family, and then on for a longer visit with Bayfield Dyment, whom we met briefly the other day. Today we drove along the shoreline of Malpeque Bay to Tyne Valley and the village of Bideford. This is an area where many of the original Dyments settled. </p>
<p>Just a very brief Dyment family history lesson here: in 1833, two Dyment brothers, John and Humphrey, left the family farm in Somerset and made their way to Canada on board the "Collina". Both had wives and children with them. John (from whom Doug is descended) made his way to Dundas, Ontario, and Humphrey went to PEI and settled in there. </p>
<p>So, today our mission was to photograph the headstones for that original Dyment couple and as many others as we could find. Our first stop was the United Church cemetery in Bideford, where Bayfield had told us to start our search. There was a service going on at the lovely little white church, so we quietly moved about taking photographs. It was quite an experience for Doug, as he has never seen so many Dyment names in one place. When he lived in New York City, he was the only Dyment listed in the phone book, and yet in this small province, with a population less than one third the size of San Francisco, there were over twenty-five names listed (and Bayfield told us they don't all put their names in the phone book)! </p>
<p>We were just finishing up when the church services ended, and immediately a man approached Doug, asking if he could help him find anyone in particular. His father, it turned out, is the custodian of the church grounds, and he kindly gave us his own email address, so if there were any questions we could write and ask. This is going to come in very handy, as it turned out that not all the stones were as easily read as we hoped, so no doubt there will be emails going back and forth. </p>
<p>We were certainly getting lots of attention from the mostly elderly patrons of the church, as an older fellow stopped for a chat with us as well. He too came from a family that settled in Bideford, about five years before Humphrey and Mary arrived. We left when there was just one car in the lot, but before doing so Doug chatted with the two elderly women waiting in the car, telling them why we were there. What a shame he hadn't spoken with them first, as a female Dyment had been at the service and had just left! They gave us directions to her home, but we were heading in the opposite direction to Bayfield's home. Everyone is so very friendly here, and we felt welcome everywhere we went. </p>
<p>We drove to Unionvale and returned to the G&E Restaurant we had eaten in our first day, but this time went to the café part instead, as we were in a bit of a dash to get to Bayfield's. Doug got his lobster roll, and I had a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich. I love these little spots where you can order something not on the menu and it's just fine. </p>
<p>On to Milburn to meet Bayfield's family ... his partner Darlene, and their thirteen-year-old son Nason. What a lovely family this is! We felt like family immediately, and settled in for a two-hour visit with them. I had tea. We talked about all that we had done, and the local Dyments. We went over all the names I had written down from the phone book and they filled me in on who they knew personally, and who they knew by family connections only. </p>
<p>Nason is just a charming young man. Much to our surprise, instead of saying hello and then vacating himself to his room, he sat and made conversation with us, told us about his life there, and seemed very comfortable chatting with us. I thought how different his life is compared to those of the children in Toronto. He has to be driven from his home in the country everywhere he goes, and he gets picked up for school on a school bus. However, he is happy about getting a high speed internet connection this summer, moreso than either of his parents, I think! </p>
<p>When we left, Darlene gave us two canning jars with clams in one, and lobster chunks in the other. Bayfield had made up a very well put together folder filled with the Dyment family history from before the Dyment boys left England in 1833 to the present day. He also gifted us with an old PEI grade school history book that provides a concise description of the island's development. It was a lovely visit and we will certainly be keeping in touch with them.</p>
<p>Our next stop was the West Point lighthouse, which had been brought to our attention by Doug's sister Sandy a few years back. She had done the tour there at the time, and much to her surprise found out that the first family who ran the lighthouse was a Mariah Dyment and her husband William "Willie" MacDonald. They ran it for fifty years, from 1875-1925. They owned a farm some ways back from the lighthouse, and raised a large family there, but Willie would go to the lighthouse each evening before dusk, and stay there all night, and many evenings they entertained neighbours there, with Mariah playing the parlour piano she had moved there within a year of taking up their new duties. They had a lovely view of the beach from the top floor of the lighthouse and many photographs and details of their lives are written up and displayed on the walls. It was very exciting to see this for ourselves, and Doug even bought a t-shirt — a rare event! — with the West Point Lighthouse insignia on it. I did have to do a little coaxing though. </p>
<p>This is the only lighthouse on PEI that is painted black and white; it was changed from the original red and white when it was discovered that the red colour (which also fades quickly) was less visible at sea. </p>
<p>Bay, as Bayfield is called informally, had given us directions to another cemetery where his parents, and many other Dyments are buried, so that was our next stop. We drove back to O'Leary, and southwest towards Knutsford for longer than we had expected it to be, but finally found the United cemetery (actually associated with the church back in O'Leary), and sure enough there were lots of Dyment stones there, and we took many more photos. </p>
<p>We were sure this was not the one he meant, though, so back we drove to O'Leary where the friendly gal at the corner store let me use the phone to call Bay for more directions. Off we went again, down that same road, but much further along towards Springfield West (almost back to the West Point lighthouse). We found it, now a Baptist Cemetery, but many years ago a United Church burial ground. There were more Dyment headstones to photograph, and at some point we hope to return for further research. It will take me a long time to enter this side of the family into the family tree, though! </p>
<p>We were hungry and tired by the time we finished up our trip here, but it was late enough that not too much was open except the fast food places, not our favourite spots. We did drive into Summerside to confirm that the restaurants were closed, and ended up at a Pizza Delight. By this time pizza sounded really good, and we enjoyed it. They have what apparently is quite common in PEI and Nova Scotia, a bread grill bar, something Susan had told us about. Doug didn't try it but I put a flat piece of whole wheat bun on a grill, "buttered" it with two different spreads, and then let it got hot and melty. Yum! And just what I needed before half a pizza too! </p>
<p>We had a very friendly hostess who suggested a favourite fishing village of hers on our day trip tomorrow. </p>
<p>Home at 8:30, tired and very happy after such a busy, productive but relaxing day. </p>
