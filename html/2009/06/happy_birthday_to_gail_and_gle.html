								<h2>Happy Birthday to Gail and Glenn, the "Womb-Mates"</h2>
								<p>It was another quiet day around here, but not so for Gail and Glenn, who turned 62. Glenn celebrated in Niagara Falls, with a buffet lunch out with Wendy, Becky, and Wayne. Gail should have celebrated first, actually, as she <strong>is</strong> a half hour older!</p>
<p>Gail and Tom were going out to the Keg for dinner at five, and so Gail opened her gifts this afternoon. I phoned just after she finished up, so got to hear about all the wonderful books, music, teas, and body lotions she received from Tom. </p>
<p>I am sure both siblings talked to the others siblings at some point during the day. We do try to do this, and I was lucky enough to find them both at home and the phone not busy!  This way, Doug and I sang "Happy Birthday" together over the phone, and no one had to hear my not-in-tune rendition on their answering machine. </p>
<p>Bryn had put together a video of the children singing "Happy Birthday" to Auntie Gail and Uncle Glenn, but on version number one, they both sang the names of the recipients at different times and/or sang "Auntie Glenn" and "Uncle Gail" ... not sure which, so he did two takes. Both are adorable, as they put all their enthusiasm into them, but how Doug and I howled when we heard Mirei do an enthusiastic flourish at the end of the second one. What a card she is! </p>
<p>Speaking of cards, Riku made a lovely card and envelope for Auntie Gail's birthday some time ago, here in San Francisco, and I had put it away until it was time to send it off to her. I took photos of them, of course(!), so I could save his "art" along with his other pieces. And it goes without saying that Auntie Gail was as thrilled with her card as Auntie Candy was with hers in February. I wish I had thought to have him make one for his Auntie Beth when I was in Japan, but those last ten days were not what they should have been. </p>
