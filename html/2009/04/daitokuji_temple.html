								<h2>Daitoku-ji Temple and "Soccer" Time!</h2>
								<p>We had our usual busy morning getting the children ready for their day at school, although both children were awake earlier than usual, so had some time to play too. It is handy to have a village of three to get two children ready for their day!</p>
<p>Riku and I left at 8:10, though, five minutes later than I would have liked to, and it was a faster, more focused, walk to school as a result! However, we made it in lots of time and today more children were wandering about the room than usual. Perhaps those first few days they were more intimidated and felt they should sit at their desks.</p>
<p>On the way out of the school grounds, where the principal stands to greet us, and a few boys behind a fence above, called out big "Hello!"s to me, grinning away when I replied. I find it interesting that boys from about 10-13 are much more likely to approach me, with the specific purpose of speaking English. Girls are less likely to do so, and even if they look interested are more shy about actually saying more than "hello". Almost always the girls will break out in giggles once they have walked away. </p>
<p>We had a tentative plan to visit a local temple today, and since this is officially Bryn's day off — Sunday in the States — he decided he could take a few hours off this morning. I had time to hang up a load of wash on the line when I got home, as Akane had taken Mirei to school, and then the three of us were to meet at the bus stop close to the house. We took just one bus to the temple, a fifteen minute ride perhaps, and I took a few photos of the neighbourhood ... a tall skinny building that looked as though it belonged in Amsterdam, a coffee roasting store, and a very large and distinctive old wooden restaurant. </p>
<p>I ended up with a lot of photos today, as the temple grounds we went to were so very interesting. The "Temple of Great Virtue" was founded in 1319, and consists of a main temple and twenty-three smaller ones, called sub-temples, I believe. Only four of these smaller temples are open to the public, and we went through two of them at a very leisurely pace.</p>
<p> Since this temple is known as a place to view at its best in the fall, when red leaves cover the gardens and walkways, it was very quiet, as most people are off seeing the temples with the cherry blossoms. Once we leave our neighbourhood and get closer into the main part of Kyoto, we see lots of Causcasion tourists, a rare breed in the "country" were we are. We hope to see one of the temples with the blossoms too, but today I was so happy strolling along with Akane and Bryn, walking the ancient wooden "outdoor" hallways, peering into tiny and not so tiny tatami rooms, and sitting occasionally to contemplate the gardens. </p>
<p>This particular temple is known for its earth and tile walls, and the first sub-temple we visited has what is known to be the smallest stone garden in Japan. Of course every single stone in every garden looks perfectly placed; they are all raked very early each morning, with not a ripple appearing in the perfect pattern. The second smaller temple we visited looked most untidy by comparison, as leaves were allowed to stay where they fell, and looked very unkempt on the bare earth garden areas. I'm sure this looks better when they completely cover the ground in the fall, but the mostly bare earth wasn't terribly attractive right now. I hope to be here in November, so will see it at its best then. </p>
<p>Moss has been taken to a new level at the temple gardens, although none of the photos do it justice. It's thick, lush, velvety, and picture perfect, but only when viewed in person, unfortunately. You'll just have to come to see it yourself!  </p>
<p>I love the wooden beams, the joinings, the huge wooden gates and doors, the benches  and tables, and the wooden temples themselves, most of them over five hundred years old. This first temple was absolutely perfect in every way. I think I will let the photos do the "talking" as it was all so beautiful ... the long winding pathways with stout green bamboo railings, a huge grove of bamboo, an ancient stone wash basin, a Go board used centuries ago, beautifully decorated on the outside , and well used with obvious markings on the top, and brown-robed monks walking looking unhurried and serene. </p>
<p>I had to be back to pick Riku up from school, so we left enough time for a Japanese lunch. (There was a French café right across the street from the temple with a delicious sounding menu, so I'm hoping to get back there before I leave). There was a nice little restaurant just up a block and so we went for noodles and broth. Since it was close to the temple, they had a soup with vegetarian broth and Akane, at my request, asked if I could substitute soba noodles for udon, which was no trouble at all for our very friendly waitress. The generous bowl of broth with a few tiny mushrooms, and lots of green mountain vegetables added to it was wonderful; the mountain vegetables look like tiny green beans, but very very slender and very tasty. I added freshly self-ground sesame seeds to it, some wasabi, and green onions, and ate and drank every bit of it. The tea, apparently a traditional tea served with noodle dishes, was just a bit too smokey and darkly roasted for my taste. This meal was a fitting end to our temple outing and we hope to do another next Monday. </p>
<p>We caught the bus to the end of the line here in the neighbourhood, and split up. I went off to meet Riku, and Akane and Bryn walked to a post office as we all need stamps. Riku enjoyed his lunch at school — beef stew today — and so needed only a snack at home. He did piano practice with Akane before she left to get Mirei, and Riku played with Lego in his room on his own for quite some time. I answered some emails, but am still very far behind, as usual. </p>
<p>Despite it being a much cooler day today, Mirei came into the house insisting that she was too hot, pulling off her tights and long-sleeved top as she talked, and pulling on the shorts and a short-sleeved top from the drying rack in the living room. After her snack I tried to convince her to at least wear a sweater to the playground but she would have none of it! It was a very fast visit there, with just a half hour before we had to be back for dinner, but I was so pleased we went despite that. On the big field, where there is usually a baseball game going on, there was a couple with at least two or three children, and another woman with them with another two or three children as well. The dad was kicking a soccer ball to the older children and Riku and Mirei stopped immediately to watch. Once in a while the tiniest toddler would get in the way, and the older children let him try to kick it before moving on. </p>
<p>Riku particularly was interested with it all and stood there smiling and staring at them, before deciding to just join in. It was obviously fine as the dad made it clear he was welcome. And of course if Riku is going to play, then so is Mirei! She got a couple of good kicks in, and was pleased as punch when the boys congratulated her, and she and Riku had the best time running up and down the full length of that big field, trying and succeeding in kicking the ball and just having fun with the other children ... and that nice dad. </p>
<p>Riku was so wiped when we all left at the same time, that Mirei took pity on him and offered to carry his overstuffed backpack home for him! It was heavy, but Mighty Mirei told me she had "<strong>strong muscles</strong> ... see(1)" and did indeed carry it all the way home with no complaints. Meanwhile, Riku walked along for part of the way carrying his open umbrella over his head! By the end of the walk, Mirei was carrying that as well. Before we got home, a car stopped beside us, with the woman and three children, so they could all wave goodbye to us! </p>
<p>Into the tub for a very quick splash, and then Akane had a yummy dinner on the table. Both children were tired, Bryn was upstairs working, and Akane had several phone calls to handle, so it was a little chaotic right at the end of a day that had been busy for everyone. Riku was sound asleep by 7:35, but poor Mirei had a hard time settling down tonight. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane were both busy on their computers, so I wrote post cards, and got on Bryn's computer for a half hour before turning in myself at 11 P.M. The night is colder tonight and it feels like rain.</p>
