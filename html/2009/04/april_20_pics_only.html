								<h2>A Hot Day ... Stayed Close to Home</h2>
								<p>I always take a quick shower before helping out in whatever way I can with the children on school mornings; sometimes I make oatmeal, sometimes cook the eggs they have each morning, and sometimes just sit with them while they eat, and then do the "morning routine" with them: hair, teeth, faces. Today when I came out dressed and ready for the day, Bryn had a perfectly cooked fried egg and delicious grainy toast waiting for me. What a treat! I usually eat after I get back from walking Riku to school. </p>
<p>The house was not the least bit cold this morning, so we knew it was going to be another hot day. I prefer this to the cold days, as the house stays cold, which means on hot days it is perfectly cool and livable inside. However, it was just fine walking Riku to school and we chatted about all the things we saw on our walk ... the gardens, what is growing, the crosswalk (where cars never stop for pedestrians but keeping driving on through), and how Riku doesn't like bicycles on the sidewalk. He thinks there should be rules about "vehicles on the roads only", but it is the law here that cars can be on the sidewalk, so we had a big talk about that. </p>
<p>Akane had left with Mirei, so I checked my emails, and wrote a few. I was quite behind as I hadn't had much computer time the past two days, so copied some blog notes too. However, there is a glitch there now, as Bryn is not able to do photos, as something broke, and now he is waiting to fix that up. He doesn't have much time either as he is working full out on both his regular job and his freelance work, so we shall see how far behind we get. </p>
<p>He is looking for some specific CDs and I volunteered to go through some more boxes, so down he came with three big ones labelled "Mirei's clothes" but weighing enough that they may contain books or CDs as well. It took a full afternoon to do this, as I was careful about the sorting ... piles for socks, tights, leggings, dresses, short-sleeved tops, clothes that are too big, and too small, etc. etc. I stacked them all neatly on the windowsill on Mirei's side of the room, and they are towering high enough that I hope they end up in the drawers soon. Clothes-horse Mirei will just love to get her hands on them! </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the CDs Bryn was hoping to find were not there. I left to pick up Riku from school at 12:30. He was hot and sweaty and very happy to hand over his heavy backpack while he skipped beside me chatting away. I always ask him about his day, but like most boys of my acquaintance, he has little to say. He doesn't know the names of many of the children in his class, but doesn't seem to mind much either, and there are other things he would rather talk about. He does like his teacher, though. </p>
<p>I went back to the sorting after Riku and I had a nice slow lunch together. He is so happy I brought veggie "bacon" with me as he is once more enjoying the little "bacon"/cheese toast he enjoyed so much in San Francisco.  </p>
<p>Akane came in about 2 P.M., Riku did his piano practice, and then they left  by bus to the ear, eye, and throat specialist for Riku, not long before Bryn left to pick Mirei up from school.  She came in with her dad looking like a tired little puppy, but she picks up pretty fast after some time to settle in. Today she enjoyed her quiet time with the little mini-fridge and accompanying food. Oh, and we found some clips for her hair, which went into her hair several ways in several different places. She is such a girly-girl, this girl! </p>
<p>Riku had four doctor appointments as part of his school check up before being admitted in the system, and it was recommended that he have excess ear wax removed from his ears. This is not an atypical problem with Asians, and Akane has it as well; due to narrow ear passages. Riku was so afraid this was going to hurt, but except for one final bit, when he cried a bit, he said it was fine. He is to go in twice a year and have this taken care of. </p>
<p>His allergies are very bad, as are Bryn's, and Akane just started sniffling too, from tree allergies. So, they both got meds for that, and also had a spray of some medication in their noses to help clear their sinuses. They are both on once-a-day Claritin too, and Riku's is to be taken in milk or non-acidic juice. </p>
<p>They didn't have to wait too long tonight (no appointments here which can go either way in terms of how long it takes to see a doctor), and were back home in time for a quick dinner of noodles and veggies. Bathtime together for the two of them, and I was reading to Riku at 7:15 p.m. </p>
<p>Akane was down from tucking Mirei in very quickly, so I made some notes and read a bit. The house is dark, though, as there is no light in the living room area right now, and it's hard to put my feet up and relax in the dining room. Bed early as a result. House still nice and cool. </p>
<p>Mom's birthday today; she was on my mind all day. </p>
