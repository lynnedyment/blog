								<h2>A Walk with Bryn in the Morning, and A Red-Letter Day for Riku!</h2>
								<p>Riku and Mirei both slept in a little later than usual, and Riku thoughtfully went to the dining room, said "good morning" to his Daddy who had been working since 1:45 A.M., and came back to bed with his book, laying quietly beside me while I took my time waking slowly. </p>
<p>We kept an eye out for ladybugs again, but there was no dew on the leaves, and we spotted only two this morning. He is getting used to his backpack, and hasn't complained about the weight of it in a few days now. In fact, Bryn offered to carry it for him yesterday and he said he was okay with it. </p>
<p>The number of children speaking to me in English continues to grow, usually starting with "Hello" and an occasional "How are you?"  too.  This morning a group of five boys asked me if I were American, and then said "Ahhh!" when I told them "from Canada". Riku volunteered that I was from San Francisco, and a couple of the children were obviously aware of that city. On the way out, I took photos of the busy courtyard filled with skippers again today. It just does my heart good to see this, as it doesn't happen so often in SF at the two or three schools I have been to. However, Amelia is skipping and loving it, and it would such fun if there were always a group she could join in with at her school. </p>
<p>After a couple of hours at home on the computer, Bryn suggested we go for a walk further north into the hills. Off we went, for a forty-five minute stroll, to discover not the hiking trails that Bryn had imagined but newly built homes tucked in just below the hills. There are some older homes too, of course, but Bryn said that homes are generally not built well enough here that they last for very long. Akane considers this house an "old" house, and it was built just twenty years ago! There were lots of garden plots, commercial size, chickens in small crated pens, and more new housing. We even saw a Western style home with a little plot of grass in the front yard, which is most usual, as usually any room outside the homes is paved over and used for parking. </p>
<p>I was keeping an eye on the clock to make sure I left in time for Riku, thinking this would be the second day of the new 2:30 departure. At 1:55 Riku walked in looking ever so pleased with himself! Yes, he had walked all the way home, with Yuu-kun, and no adult with them; we were so excited for him! He had a snack and then walked over on his own (with Bryn keeping an eye out the front door ... this can be a busy corner), to invite Yuu-kun to play. They had a great time, of course, running from one activity to another, sharing a snack, and keeping busy. </p>
<p>Mirei was at school for just a half day today, so Akane picked her up, they had udon noodles out for lunch, and did a little shopping. Mirei was delighted when she discovered Yuu-kun here; she is quite the flirty girl, and kept trying to get his attention by being affectionate, funny, or merely silly. It worked. She managed to make him laugh, and then happily followed the two boys about. </p>
<p>Usual evening routine followed ... piano practice for Riku while Mirei and I walked around four big blocks, then reading with his dad for Riku, and tubs for both the children. Akane made a delicious dinner of fried rice with vegetables, and salmon sashimi for all but me. Mirei just amazed me by eating about half of the salmon, as well as a huge bowl of the rice. Two salmon bites, rice, three pieces of salmon, and rice. At one point I suggested she leave some for Riku, so she picked up a piece, hand-fed him and went back to eating more herself. </p>
<p>As a special treat, as we were eating so early, the children got to watch various videos (from Grandpa and some songs Bryn chose) as well as a bit of "The Simpsons" on Akane's computer at the table. Riku just howled at the latter!   </p>
<p>Riku's allergies are really bad right now, he's on medication, and both children were overly tired from a later night last night, so Akane went up at 7 P.M. with Mirei and I was reading to Riku at 7, with lights out at 7:15. Over thirty-five minutes later he was still awake saying "<strong>Man!</strong> I am <strong>never</strong> going to get to sleep." I was lying there thinking about a study I read, stating that children have a hard time processing anything visually stimulating for up to three hours before bedtime; that their brains just can't shut it off. And minutes after that thought, Riku said to me "Nana, wasn't that funny when Bart was running around with no clothes on?" Okay, I'm convinced! He finally gave in at 8 o'clock!  </p>
<p>Bryn went to bed fairly early tonight, so I had access to his computer for a good long time. I was writing one final email when Riku called out for me, coughing constantly, so after two tries at getting him settled, I happily turned in early.</p>
