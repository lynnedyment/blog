								<h2>Rainy Morning, Lists, and a Sunny Break in the Afternoon!</h2>
								<p>Riku and I had just wakened at 6:40 when Mirei peeked in, happily announcing to her mom "They're awake!" before tumbling onto our bed to join us. We have a nice cozy bed and it's plenty big enough for three. We stayed in there for twenty minutes, snuggling, and talking and giggling, and then it was time to get up and on with our day. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn slept in for a rare change, so I got their morning fruit bowls ready (Bryn almost always does this), and made their porridge with strawberries too. They always have three courses in the morning but love nothing more than a break between the second and third, not easy during the weekday rush to get off to school. The children decided to make a "feast" for their mom and dad with the tiny food products they have been collecting over that past few years. It was fun to watch them decide on what fish, vegetables, fruit, bread products, sushi, and desserts to serve them, and I must say it was a huge wonderfully assorted breakfast they prepared. It took them the better part of an hour to put it all together! </p>
<p>Bryn prepared a "to do list" for the children while he was having breakfast. It was quite extensive, especially Riku's (!), and reminded me of the lists my dad would make for us each Saturday morning, on long sheets of lined paper. Ours, however, never did have "ball/Frisbee" on it, but more mundane things like "wash kitchen floor", "clean bedrooms", and "finish ironing"! I must say we were not six and three years old either! </p>
<p>So, Riku's list was: piano A.M., piano P.M., spelling, letter to Kai, reading, drawing for Kai, Chinese, ball, and frisbee.  He got through it pretty darned quickly, with his morning piano practice over after breakfast, as well as spelling with his dad, and reading to his dad. </p>
<p>Mirei's list was shorter of course: Chinese alphabet, counting one to twenty in French along with a friendly teacher on YouTube, recognizing her letters from A-Z in English (she's reading book titles right now, thus the upper case), being read to, and practicing her printing. She is doing just great in all of these, and of course loves to be told that it's time for her "homework". </p>
<p>Riku had written a letter to his classroom in San Francisco yesterday and drawn a picture of his new house to enclose with it, so he and Bryn took their umbrellas and went off to mail that. Bryn headed off to a café to work this morning, even though it is his day off. Perhaps if the sun had been out we might have gone off to find something to do together. It seemed a perfect day to make cookies, but we have only a microwave here, and most homes do not have a full oven anyway. Somehow it seemed an oatmeal/raisin cookie baking day! </p>
<p>Mirei and I had some time alone in my room while Riku did his piano practice. He had a hard time settling down to it today, not fun for anyone. Bryn was home soon after that for a hot udon noodle and cabbage lunch Akane had prepared, after which they decided to go off to run some errands. </p>
<p>It was time to get out for some fresh air and exercise, and the rain stopped just in the nick of time for this! The children and I headed off for the playground, despite the damp sand and play equipment, but stopped to see if Yuu-kun would like to join us. He did, and we had such a great time. Riku took his Frisbee along, and the four of us played together. Riku enjoyed being the timemaster, and when he held up a long green branch of leaves it was our signal to throw that Frisbee! Mirei enjoyed both trying to catch it, and trying to throw it, and Yuu-kun was very patient with her. The boys played alone together too, and Mirei did a little digging in the sandbox, wishing she had her sand toys, not yet out of a packed box. We were out for an hour and forty minutes, and it was sweet to watch Mirei walking home hand in hand with Yuu-kun. </p>
<p>Two blocks from home, we met Kiko and Pieter, the couple we met on the day of the neighbourhood parade on Easter weekend. It was lovely to see them, and while we decided we would try to get together for a cup of tea with each other, somehow there was some stepping-on-shoes going on between Pieter and Mirei! Riku joined in, then Kiko! It was such fun for the children and they loved it that the adults thought they were so fast at it! There is something very special about being in a foreign land and running into familiar faces. </p>
<p>The fun continued at home, and the next hour and a half flew by too. Riku wrote his letter to a former classmate/pal at his Saturday Japanese group in San Francisco, and did a great picture of a sign in front of a restaurant that he and Bryn had passed on their walk yesterday. </p>
<p>Mirei had been practicing her numbers in four different languages over and over, keeping herself busy and happy while doing so. I told her I wanted to video her, and Riku decided he would like to introduce her. This took it to a whole new level! We did four "takes", the first two without the camera, and then got it rolling. </p>
<p>Riku was as cute as could be, as he practiced how he would introduce her several times. He also took charge of where she would stand, and would "pull" her out on stage, often kissing her on the top of her head as he stood behind her coaching her. The first time through it was strictly the numbers, which she did like a pro. The second time he decided to ask her a couple of questions, and by the third time, when I recorded it all, he had a whole raft of questions he was asking, and had forgotten the original theme was numbers! It was all too funny and very sweet. As soon as Bryn can get to emptying my card from the camera I shall post it. </p>
<p>Did some emailing, but also am working my way through some magazines I brought with me, so read a few articles, and wrote down the titles of some new books, before settling in for the night at 11 P.M. </p>
<p>p.s. Yes, Mirei got to check off all the chores on her list too! Bryn was very pleased that Riku got all his done as well, even though we substituted "playground" for the "ball" portion of it. </p>
<p>p.p.s. I must remember the way Mirei currently pronounces W, as it makes me smile every time I hear it. Duh-you-boo.</p>
