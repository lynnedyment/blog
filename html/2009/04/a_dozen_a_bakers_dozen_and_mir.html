								<h2>A Dozen, a Baker's Dozen, and Mirei is Printing "Nana"!</h2>
								<p>This morning on the way to school I spotted a ladybug in the bushes again, and pointed it out to Riku. We didn't have much meandering time but in the short distance we still had to walk, Riku spotted twelve in total. I pointed out to him that made a dozen, a new--to-him term, and then told him about a baker's dozen when he found one final one. He liked the idea of a "free" extra. I told him of course about that extra cookie or donut at the bakers when I was growing up. </p>
<p>Mirei and I took another long walk today, this time with the goal of buying "sultana biscuits" as they were known when I was a little girl. Mom would almost always pick up a large package of them on Thursday night (our grocery night), and the entire family liked them except Don. He called them "crackers with bugs in them."! I spotted them on our last walk but hadn't taken money with me. </p>
<p>Today Mirei asked if she could take her babies for a walk too, so off we went with two babies in a tiny stroller. Mirei had a pack on her back, and a sweet funny pink purse Auntie Candy had sent along for her, so she looked quite the part of the overburdened mother! </p>
<p>We met Yuu-kun's grandmother (Baba) on our way there, and said "hello" in Japanese to lots of friendly people. Mirei has an opinion, and not favourable ones, about every person who doesn't reply to her! They are, in her humble opinion, one of the following... mean, not happy, not nice, and she always tells me she doesn't like those people. I have never understood how anyone can totally ignore a friendly child's greeting, but they're still out there.</p>
<p>Mirei and I were wandering around looking and ran into Akane! She had gone out earlier on her bike, and stopped in for a few items too. After saying goodbye, we continued with our shopping spree and lucked out. Mirei chose two containers of creme caramel, for her and Riku, we bought two packages of the cookies, much smaller than ours at home, and then lucked out when we spotted a small bag of half-sized marshmallows! I was going to bring some with me for our hot chocolate the next time I visited, so we were very excited to find these here. </p>
<p>I took a few photos in the store... of a single cob of corn, shrunk wrapped in plastic, and of some carrots, and noted the prices of some everyday items too. And then Mirei carefully took all our food and placed it on the check out counter; how disappointed we were to learn they don't take credit cards there and had to leave it all behind! The corner stores do, as did one of the larger grocery stores on Tuesday, but this particular one is cash only. I carried home the stroller and babies, as Mirei was tired of all the work by then. </p>
<p>We went out for lunch, had some quiet time, and when Akane and Bryn left at 1:15 to meet Riku at school and walk with him to his piano lesson, Mirei and I headed out to the local playground. For the first time ever, we were the only ones there for the entire time! We threw and rolled the ball we took along to each other, and Mirei sat on my lap in the shade for the longest time while we watched all the ants scurrying here and there right below our feet. At 2:45 we decided we could walk toward the river and see if we could meet up with Riku and his parents at the bridge. It was a long walk for this little girl and she yawned about four times, so we went right home after not spotting our crew. They were home already, having taken a different way home. </p>
<p>Riku had a nice long evening to himself tonight, which he thoroughly enjoyed. He read to me before his tub, early tubs for them both, and long ones too. Riku was the last out and he and I spent five minutes squirting water at each other from narrow nozzled plastic thingies, each time I opened the door to the tub area. My guess is we will be playing this game until I leave. We started it last night, and he's pretty sneaky, as he got out of the tub at one point, hiding behind the accordion door, so I was a very handy target! </p>
<p>Akane prepared a delicious dinner with spring cabbage lightly cooked, with tofu strips, a rice/barley mix which she noticed Riku has at school, lots of tiny cucumber slices, sushi for them (Riku got Bryn's one piece!),  a big bowl of fresh tofu cooked in a tasty broth (which Mirei and I both particularly liked), and a small bowl of kabocha squash, cut in fine strips, with onion, and thinly sliced potato, all in a golden miso broth. </p>
<p>We were nice and early and ahead of schedule for our usual evening routine, so Riku was allowed to read all through dinner. He did a great job eating, but was totally concentrating on his book between bites. I know what a pleasure that is, to just read and relax while eating, and it's a rare treat for sure for Riku.</p>
<p>Mirei has been printing her name very nicely now for four days, and tonight I showed her how to print "NANA". She did the most amazing job with it, and then wrote it from memory, on the opposite side of the paper, but writing NAAN instead, but she remembered all the letters so we were impressed anyway. She had insisted on "doing my homework" while Riku did his spelling list with Bryn... twenty-five words with some new ones mixed in tonight, and a happy boy with his 25/25 score! </p>
<p>Riku was asleep tonight at 7:45, and I slept until 8:15!! Akane had fallen asleep with Mirei, so I got busy with emails and my blog, finishing off the night by going through a massive number of photos to get them down to just six per blog. Bryn has the program working to get photos again, and I am very excited to have it done! Still lots to catch up on with those pics, but slowly but surely they will get done. It's just so darned hard to choose those six though...  </p>
<p>Mirei woke again tonight, crying. Still sick with a heavy cold, and tonight her Daddy is sick too with another sinus infection, it seems. Riku, happily, is improving!</p>
