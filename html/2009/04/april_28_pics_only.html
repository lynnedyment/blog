								<h2>Songs, Spaghetti, and Sorting</h2>
								<p>Lovely walk to school with Riku today. Every day he asks "Are we late?" and we have never been late, but what he really means is do we have to rush to school, or can we meander? This was a meandering day, although we have a new strategy for keeping up our pace... we try to not let anyone behind us at the bridge catch up with us. It sometimes doesn't work, of course, as often a group of older children will scootch by us, but for the most part we can take those little peeks behind, and move just a little faster. </p>
<p>After learning that we could bake cookies in the combination oven, Akane and I decided we would go off to one of the larger grocery stores in the area to try to find vanilla, baking soda and baking powder, and flour at a better price. She wasn't sure that some of those things would be sold in the smaller local store here. </p>
<p>We didn't dash out the door, but had breakfast first, Akane hung out some laundry, and Mirei listened to the first twenty or so songs on the CD that Doug had sent to her. This little girl loves to sing and has a great memory for learning new songs quickly, and today that was "Oh, Do You Know the Muffin Man...". I was lucky to have a mom who sang to me, as so many of these songs were ever so familiar! </p>
<p>We walked to the bus stop, the first stop on the route for three or four bus routes, and passed a huge long line of bikes. The buses are well used, and busy, and the bikes are used by those commuting by bus to work or school. I just had time for a quick photo of some of them, when Mirei told me to hurry, the bus was coming. It wasn't, but she wanted to make sure I guess that I wouldn't miss it. This was my first time on the number 37 bus, and I bought a day pass for Y500 (approx. $5.00) as we were going to stop on the way to go to a whole foods store to stock up a bit on some veggie food for me. </p>
<p>It was a small store, so Mirei was free to wander, looking at all the packages and occasionally coming over to see if she could buy it. One of the items was for wafer biscuits, but tiny squares, instead of the long thin wafers my grandmother bought for me. They went into my basket along with a kilo of brown rice, some "meatballs" just for fun, a package of risotto, ready to cook, and a veggie "burger" which I will try on the wonderfully dense loaf of whole grain bread that was on sale for 50% off, due to the Golden Days holiday tomorrow. It was so good that we wished we had bought three loaves of it! Bryn and I especially liked it, a fabulous caraway seed loaf. </p>
<p>We peeked into a bike store to see about a bike helmet for Mirei, as she could go in the basket on Akane's bike, once she has a helmet. They didn't have the right size in the right style, but Mirei sure looked cute trying them on. Her favourites were, of course, the pink ones. </p>
<p>Back on the bus, and it was close enough to lunch when we arrived that I suggested we eat right away. There happened to be an Italian restaurant just inside the door where we entered, we checked the menu which was just fine for me, and the prices were very reasonable too. My entree was about $5.50, and there is no tax or tip required in Japan. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the laws in Japan still allow smoking in public places, and there were enough smokers in the restaurant that it wasn't the perfect lunch. However, I had ordered spaghetti in a tomato/cream sauce, which was just delicious. Yum! Akane chose a pasta with egg and ham to share with Mirei. </p>
<p>Mirei had decided in her own mind how she wanted to break that egg (it came with a partially cooked egg on the top to be stirred in to form a sauce), and burst into tears when Akane did it, before Mirei could tell her mom she wanted to do it herself. She burst into tears and then was so angry that she refused to eat one bite and wouldn't try mine either. This is such unusual behaviour for Mirei; she always behaves incredibly well when out in public, and likes to be out in the world too, so she was either overly hungry or tired out, probably the former, as she asked to nurse and was asleep in two minutes! </p>
<p>I knew we would not be sitting there long enough for Mirei to have the nap she needed, so I picked up all our bags, and Akane carried her out of the restaurant... where she burst into angry tears, of course! Fifteen minutes was not enough sleep! I wish I could have taken a photo of her, as it was the most pitiful thing... nose running, refusing to have it wiped, sitting on the floor just to the side of the opening to the restaurant, refusing to budge, and sobbing loudly. Poor wee girl! I suggested Akane go off for a few minutes as she was a reminder that all that Mirei needed was a quiet spot with her mom! I talked to her quietly, got rebuffed a lot, then less so, and within ten minutes, we were walking towards the grocery store. </p>
<p>And to make it even better, the mall provided shoppers with child oriented "cars". We spotted a little girl with a pink one, which I was sure that Mirei would want, and my heart dropped a little when Akane came towards us with an Ultraman car instead. However, Mirei was pleased as punch and we had a very pleasant grocery store experience. About fifteen minutes later, we heard a little child crying. Mirei wanted to see what was wrong, and so we peeked down the aisle and saw a little girl sitting on the floor, crying hard. Mirei's comment? "She's pro'ly tired." Yup, I agreed. We found everything we needed, bought more than we really could carry, and were happy to be at the terminal for the buses, so we all got seats! Mirei was fading fast toward the end of the trip, but those little square wafer biscuits and some almonds and cashews I had with me did the trick. We arrived home just after 2 p.m. </p>
<p>Akane and I were both ready for hot cups of tea, Akane's first Co-Op food order was delivered, I answered some emails, while Mirei got to open a present from Auntie Susan and Kevin! It was a lovely pink T-shirt with a yellow carousel horse on the front, short sleeved, and it went on her immediately. She sat at the table with me, and "wrote" a thank you note, printing MIREI in the corner after drawing a few circles and whatevers. She wanted to do her "homework" after that, and printed the letters W, B, and R. I love the serious look on her face, with her tongue sticking out, ala Gram. </p>
<p>Yuu-kun was here to play with Riku at 2:40, and of course Mirei was happy to tag along after them, running to keep up and get Yuu-kun's attention. </p>
