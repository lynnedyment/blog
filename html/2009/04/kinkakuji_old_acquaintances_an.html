								<h2>Kinkaku-ji, Old Acquaintances, and New Friends</h2>
								<p>Greg, a friend of Akane's from Tokyo, and his mom and a friend, were in town yesterday and today. We made plans yesterday to meet them at one of the most famous temples in Kyoto, Kinkaku-ji. I will write a bit of the blurb from our tour book about it ...</p>
<blockquote>Originally built as a country retirement villa in 1397 (don't you just love that?!) for Shogun Yoshimitsu, his son, in accordance with Yoshimiutu's will, later converted it to a temple. The first floor built in "palace" style reflects the courtly elegance of the Heian period. The second floor is built in "samurai-house" style, while the third floor is bare bones "Zen temple style." </blockquote>
<blockquote>In 1950 it was burned down by a jealous monk, who believed it was too beautiful to be viewed. So, it appears to be shiny and brand new,  and the reconstruction did follow the original design. That was to have had all three stories of the temple covered with gold, but for reasons of money or time, only completed the ceiling of the third floor. </blockquote>
<blockquote>By 1987 it was completed with the gold foil, now five times thicker than the original, and was extended down to the lower floors. He was a wealthy man, who was not your typical warring samurai; he spent most of his time here in Kyoto, establishing himself as an intelligent and peaceful politician.</blockquote>
<p>Kay, Greg's delightful, quirky, and fun-loving 80-year-old mom was her charming self. I met her a few months ago in San Francisco, when she and Gregg spent a late afternoon and late evening with us. She keeps insisting that I visit her in Kyoto one day as she has room for visitors and lots of wonderful restaurants she would like to take me to. I would also very much like to meet her daughter, who sounds as fascinating and eclectic as her mom, but with a different view of life. One day perhaps... </p>
<p>Unfortunately, visitors cannot go into the temple, and all the hundreds of visitors, a huge number of them students from all over Japan, were crowded into quite a small area, once we had done the small walk around the lovely lake surrounding the temple. </p>
<p>We stopped at a homey cafe outside the temple area, and I had a most delicious fried rice dish with various (in "season") pickles. Kay insisted on me sharing her meal, so I had three fried potato wedges, and a small bowl of cabbage salad. The small upstairs restaurant was so busy, and the minute we finished our meal, the table was cleared and we were out of there! It made sense to linger over tea somewhere else. Just down the block was a coffee shop, very quiet and empty when we walked in. We had tea, and Kay insisted we have a famous chestnut and red bean dessert with it. It's very sweet and Akane and Gregg declined, but Kay, Ichiko, and I ate ours. It was served in a china tea cup, as was the tea. Cost of the single cup was $4.00 and the dessert was $6.00. </p>
<p>Akane and I headed off to pick up Riku after saying our goodbyes at the bus stop. On our way to the temple, between bus trips, we passed a patisserie with a sign outside announcing that they had pain au levain! This is our favourite bread in SF, as it is a hearty 50% whole wheat sourdough, but I think the term refers to a country style bread, with lots of substance. We made sure to stop and pick some up and found a delightful little bakery, with Edith Piaf singing in the background, and a very friendly smiling woman behind the counter. It was hard to find really good bread in Sakai, even a loaf of whole wheat, but apparently people who live here demand more and all the French bakeries are happy to oblige. More about bread another time. </p>
<p>Riku had his piano lesson today. We were at the school at 1:30 to meet him; Akane walked him to his lesson, just fifteen minutes away, and I walked home, taking his heavy backpack with me. His lesson went well and he likes his female teacher very much. Lessons here cost almost half of what they did in SF. </p>
<p>Just a block away from the house, a lovely young woman stopped me to tell me, in quite good English, that her son goes to grade one at Riku's school. There are four classes with 30 children in each, and her son is in one of the other classes. However, they live very close by, and I suggested that perhaps the two boys could play together one day. Her name is Noriko, and she has a darling little girl under one, I would guess. She was close to sleep in the stroller. I pointed out the house to her, and told her to just knock on the door and come by.  An hour later she did! Bryn answered the door, and they had a little chat. She had a gift of cookies for them, and Bryn told her that Riku was at piano and we could try another day. Her little guy was whizzing around on his bike, and I'm sure we will see him around here often. </p>
<p>Bryn thinks that perhaps many of the neighbours with children would like to have their children have a chance to speak English, and obviously the old order of not getting together until one is properly introduced has gone by the boards here, at least in this child-oriented neighbourhood! </p>
<p>The minute Riku came in, his first question was whether he could play with Yuu-kun. Luckily he was standing outside his door, so after checking with Akane, off he dashed, with a warning to not follow him too far from home! I went out as well, thinking if they wanted to go to the playground I would walk with them, even though it's obviously not something that has to be done here. The children are always out playing here and there, just as we all were when we were growing up. Yuu-kun asked if Riku could play at his house; he checked with his grandmother, who is also visiting, and off they went to his house, followed by three other children, all girls. I walked over with Mirei a half hour later, and Riku was thrilled to bits to have had this time with these new friends. His life is going to be very different here in this regard, and it makes me happy. </p>
<p>Bryn had a Mirei story for me, of course. An older woman gave up her seat to Mirei on the bus ride home, and Mirei was chatting away at full speed with Bryn standing beside her. A nearby woman was smiling away at her, obviously enjoying listening to this happy little girl, when Mirei looked up and — in perfect Japanese — asked the woman if she would like to sit beside her; Bryn said that obviously wasn't expected, that little Japanese-speaking girl!  </p>
<p>Akane had a delicious dinner prepared early for us, so the children tubbed after dinner tonight, and after Riku's reading and spelling sessions with Bryn. On the Net', Bryn had found a list of the most common English words, 220 in all, and in two days have done 30 of them. They're really easy right now, but will get a little harder as they go along. Riku enjoys doing this and loves those daddy-made stars as his reward.  :)  Mirei, too, did her "homework", naming the letters on the titles of books, and then it was bedtime. Riku was out like a light at 7:35 and Mirei not long after.</p>
