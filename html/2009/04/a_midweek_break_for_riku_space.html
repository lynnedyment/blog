								<h2>A Mid-Week Break for Riku, Space, Vincent and a Nest-Builder</h2>
								<p>This is the beginning of "Golden Week", a Japanese spring break, so Riku had today off from school. We were lying in bed looking through the new book on space that Akane had bought for him last night, when Mirei joined us. How I wish I had set up a tape recorder as I sat listening to these two cuddled together in my cozy bed. Here is a bit of the scenario and dialogue... "Mirei, do you want to learn about space?" "Yes Riku, I do." Riku closes the book, and says "Mirei, I want you to think about space for a minute. Close your eyes." and watching her, says again "Mirei, close your eyes." When she has done his bidding, he said "I want you to think about space for a minute. Imagine millions of stars." This went on for some time, with Riku opening the book, showing her a picture, telling her about it, and continuing on. He sounded so much like his daddy! </p>
<p>Gail called to say hello to Riku, as he was at school when she called and spoke to Mirei. However, Riku's hearing is not good, thanks to those stuffed up sinus passages so I ended up chatting with her instead after he gave up. </p>
<p>We all ate breakfast together today, a rare event, and it was just wonderful. Riku had drawn a picture with lots and lots of stars, and an astronomer way down below, looking upward. I told him it reminded me of a painting by a famous man called Vincent Van Gogh who also painted stars. Bryn found the painting on the Net' I was referring to and showed him some others as well, including his small but tidy room.</p>
<p> I ended up telling Riku a bit about his life... his medical problem with his ears, his supportive brother,  how he loved to paint the stars and flowers. That led to the lovely song by Don McLean called "Vincent" but that I always call "Starry Starry Night". </p>
<p>After breakfast it was piano practice and spelling time for Riku, so Mirei and I went to my room with Akane's computer and spent all our time there looking at videos of her and the other children... at the beach with Amelia and Riku, Mirei with Riku when she was very young, not yet walking, her cousins in Toronto, birthday parties with Auntie Susan, Kevin, Mari, baby Finn, Brent. Riku joined us when he was finished, chuckling once more over the video that his cousin Bryn.</p>
<p>Pieter, the friendly neighbour we met two weeks ago, stopped by with four lovely big ripe tomatoes for us, and had some time to chat with Bryn too. He told Bryn about a shuttle to the airport which sounds a much cheaper, faster, and more comfortable trip than the trains/bus route they have been using. Riku asked Pieter where his girlfriend was, which made Pieter laugh; Kiku is his wife, and the children like her too. </p>
<p>After lunch, I took the children to the playground up the street. It was hot and the children explored a little trail at the far side, finding lots of flowers and bugs to check out. It was just the quiet time outdoors that both children love. There was time for a little Frisbee throwing although at one point, the Frisbee went into a gated pool area with a high fence around it. Riku, to my surprise, walked down to a dad tossing balls to his son, and asked him if he could get it for him! We all clapped after he made that climb on our behalf. Riku found some boys on that lower level with collectible cards, and sat down and joined them, again to my surprise. They were very generous about letting him handle them, they chatted with him too, and let Mirei look at the cards too when they went off to a shadier spot themselves. </p>
<p>We got home to find empty boxes at the foot of the stairs, and Akane and Bryn upstairs sorting through more. Bryn had set the children's colourful rug on the floor, and their twin beds up in their room, although until there are shades covering up their many windows, they likely won't be sleeping in there. It gets so light so early! But, that set Riku off sorting and rearranging all the toys/bins/and boxes of his belongings. He is a boy  that takes after his Nana; he wants his things organized asap, and enjoys doing it. He's a nest-builder for certain! Mirei was happily sitting on her bed, making up a smaller bed for her babies, and tucking them in. She too is a nest builder too in her own female way.</p>
<p>And then followed... Riku's second piano practice (he missed last night), and I had some computer time while Mirei did her homework. naming her letters with her dad, and enjoyed some story time with him too. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn walked out to find a desk, and the children had some playtime together with a big yellow plastic bus, a gift from Riku's third or fourth birthday. Akane made big bowls of noodles, broth and veggies for the children's dinner, they had a long shower together with their dad, and I got them ready for bed. Riku had been playing with his robot and hated to stop, but I promised him he could have it first thing in the morning. The last thing he said to me was "Are you sure you will remember?"</p>
<p>The desk was delivered tonight (!), right up to the bedroom/study (free delivery, as this was, or very cheap delivery service is very common here, but it's Sunday and the delivery was after 6 P.M., so I was very impressed!)</p>
<p>Bryn made Akane and me toasted tomato sandwiches for dinner and did up the dishes. What a treat! Akane fell asleep with Mirei at 7:45, Bryn was working in his new office upstairs, and I had lots of time to go through photos, answer emails, and blog! What a productive and fun day for all!</p>
