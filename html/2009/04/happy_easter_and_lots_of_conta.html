								<h2>Happy Easter ... and Lots of Contact with the Locals, Too!</h2>
								<p>We had a fun Easter morning here, and I have lots of photos to show for it too! Riku was awake at 6 A.M. and thank goodness I was asleep at 10:30 last night, as I read him two chapters in his book; when Mirei joined us a half hour later, we read all four Easter books I had brought with me as well. </p>
<p>We weren't convinced that Ayako was going to make it out of bed to join us, but finally she did, and we adults gathered in the living/dining room area and watched two very excited children begin the hunt. There isn't a lot of furniture in this area, a sofa and a table and chairs, a keyboard, and a hutch, but somehow Bryn and I managed. The night before we put together  lots of little plastic eggs, filled with either pastel jelly beans or pastel M&Ms, plus lots of little plastic packages tied with cord, that Bryn filled, just as Doug and I did for our two, and Kelly did for her children. </p>
<p>After the last packet was found, we all sat at the table for  fruit, hard-boiled eggs, some tasty bakery treats that Ayako had brought with her, and tea & hot chocolate.</p>
<p>Not long later, Bryn and Riku went off to the playground to play Frisbee, and Mirei and I watered the front garden area. We filled several buckets with water, with Mirei "helping" me carry and pour it on the "very thirsty plants!", before we discovered a hose right in the front of the house! It was fun, and after they had lots of water, we walked over to the playground too. It was hot, and Bryn was ready to leave when we got there, but the children and I stayed on for another hour or so. Riku had discovered a little path among some bushes, and he and Mirei happily played "house" tucked away in there for a half hour or more; Mirei had her purse and bag of goodies hanging on a branch and there were lots of "Daddy", "Mommy" and "honey"s being banded about. </p>
<p>I was sitting on a swing above them, when an elderly woman came by, pushing a walker/chair. She sat nearby and started talking to me in Japanese. I told her I was from Canada, and once in a while when the children came to tell me something she fired off some questions to them too. Riku didn't always understand what she was saying but he was very polite and stayed until she ran out of steam. </p>
<p>Then along came a man, perhaps in his fifties, who was told immediately by the woman that I was from Canada. He instantly started talking to me in very easily understood English. His daughter used to live in Toronto, but now lives in Oregon and he and his wife visit her family — an American husband, and two teenage grandsons — each year. They fly to Vancouver and then drive down, and they very much like Vancouver as well. Turned out that he lives on the same road that we do, and when he left he said that perhaps we could visit one day. He knows I am here for another five weeks. </p>
<p>Before he left, however, three more women joined our little group. Two were older and it was obvious the middle gal had brought them out for a walk. Of course, the first woman announced I was from Canada, and so they got some information from the sole male there. It was very friendly and the women paid lots of attention to the children when they joined us. Mirei was very vocal of course and they were delighted that she could talk to them. There was lots of smiling, and bowing, and pats on heads for the little ones before we all said our goodbyes. Perhaps I will see them again! </p>
<p>Not too long after we got home, we heard music playing, and Bryn called for me to go to the door quickly with my camera. There was a very colourful parade in progress, and I will let a photo describe the scene as it varied in tone and concept. A beautiful large umbrella seemed to play a large role, and there were monks (if that is the correct term) in plain brown robes, and students in uniforms, and ordinary people walking along as well. It was quite lovely and a treat to see. </p>
<p>One woman who had been walking along with the group seemed to be holding back at our house. I thought she was merely being polite and letting me take photos unobstructed by her, but in fact she was waiting to talk to us. She is a local gal, born and raised in the main part of Kyoto, but now living here, just a few blocks away, in what she feels is the country now. Her name is Kiko, and she is married to a Dutchman named Peter, whom she met in the math department of a university in Houston, Texas, eight years ago! They are a charming couple, here just three months, and delighted to meet some "foreigners", as they put it, having seen just one or two in their time here. She is chatty and warm, and Peter and Bryn chatted easily as well. They liked Texas and enjoyed their time there. When we said goodbye, after Bryn and Peter exchanged contact information, Kiko went to shake my hand and then leaned over the fence and gave me a hug instead. I do hope we'lI see them again! Oh, Kiko also told me that the parade was a neighbourhood event, and she believed it was meant to give good luck to those under the umbrella.</p>
<p>After the children had lunch, Akane and Ayako went off in the car to buy groceries and a shelving unit for the kitchen. I tried unsuccessfully to put Mirei down for her nap. She is used to having one from 1–2 at school, and Bryn was hoping to keep her on track, but no such luck again today! Once it cooled down a little Bryn took the children to the playground again, and I had some computer time for blogging. </p>
<p>When I thought they would be on their way home, I ran the tub, and minutes later in they walked. They were all hot, and the tub was the perfect temperature, Riku assured me. While I tubbed the children, Bryn figured out how to bake the veggie pizza with Japanese instructions only(!), and cooked carrots and broccoli for the children's dinner. We had a great evening with them; they both ate a great dinner, Bryn and Riku read, and the children were in their PJs and ready for tuck-in when Akane and Ayako arrived home. Riku was sound asleep at 7:30 and Mirei not much later. </p>
<p>I ate the last of my fried rice with veggies from Friday night, and worked hard on a blog for some of the evening. I also did a very small bit of Ancestry as it's a treat for me just before bedtime. </p>
<p>Another week of school begins tomorrow for the children ... and a busy week for three adults too. </p>
<p>The darling drawing of the chick was done by Amelia and arrived for the family here for Easter. (I hope I have one waiting for me in SF! She had made a big one which was on their front door the week before Easter... love it!) </p>
