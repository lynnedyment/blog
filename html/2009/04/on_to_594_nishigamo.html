								<h2>On to 59-4 Nishigamo!</h2>
								<p>It was wonderful to see Bryn waiting for me when I finally got out the door into the main area! We had quite the struggle with the big square box (fully loaded), my big blue suitcase (equally stuffed), plus my own carry-on bag with most of my clothes in it, and a small knapsack. The box was not just heavy but extremely awkward to carry, but getting to the train itself was fairly easy ... an elevator down to the platform and a twenty-minute sit while we waited. </p>
<p>When each train comes in there is an announcement made that the train will be cleaned before boarding is allowed. It's more than just going through and picking up any trash, but the floors get cleaned, the window ledges dusted, and the seats automatically turn to face the opposite direction. </p>
<p>There were two very loud and fairly young American males sitting in front of us. They had been drinking on the plane, and were loud while waiting in the station, as well as on the train. One of them was particularly loud and using foul language, and the conductor spoke to them right at the beginning of the trip, asking them to keep their voices down. They did and we were glad of it. On most trains, in most countries I believe, one would just have to grin and bear this kind of behavior. </p>
<p>We took a more expensive but faster express train to Kyoto, with just three stops, and arrived in at the Kyoto station at 6:15 P.M. We realized that we would not be able to get on the bus with these large and cumbersome bags, so headed for the taxi queue, a long and arduous process. Too late I realized I should have taken along the portable wheels, as it would have made this whole process so easy! </p>
<p>Taxi cabs here have seat backs covered in quite "fussy" white lace-like coverings, not just on the passenger seats but on the driver's seat as well. They look like something a very old-world style grandma at home would have on her chesterfield set. It was good to sit back and take in the scenery along the way, as it was a good twenty minutes ride "home". We passed through the busy downtown area, with lots of shops, then through a more industrial-feeling section, and finally into the more suburban area with homes, and more trees, heading toward the mountainous hills Bryn had described so well. They are at the very most northern tip of Kyoto, and as we drove along a river, the banks were lined with blossoming cherry trees. I decided I would take a long walk one day, once Riku is in school for a full day. </p>
<p>There were a few twists and turns to reach the house, and there we were, just as Doug and I had seen it on the computer at home (Google maps). I could have picked it out myself. We came in with me expecting to have two children running to greet me, but instead they were in the bath with Akane, and so while we were waiting for them, Bryn gave me a tour of the house. It's a lovely house, with bright spacious rooms, especially the living room/dining area, my room, and the children's room. </p>
<p>For now there are still lots of boxes around, waiting not only to be emptied, but for places to put it all. There are no closets in the bedrooms, two of which are traditional tatami rooms where dressers aren't allowed to be placed. Once the room now housing most of the boxes is cleared, a large wall unit will be used for Akane's and Bryn's clothes. So I can see there is lots to be done and, with three of us, it should all come together eventually. </p>
<p>It seemed a long time before those children came bursting out of the bathroom in their PJs! They climbed up on the sofa with me, both chatting at top speed, and each of them trying so hard to get my attention. Riku was showing me a new book, and wanting me to find hidden shapes with him, while Mirei was determined that I would talk only to her. It was so good to see those faces again! Riku looks so different with his missing tooth, and now there is a second one, close to coming out, but sticking out from his mouth on a funny angle. It looks hilarious! </p>
<p>He was most anxious to show me some "special presents!" he had for me, and Mirei wanting to show me their bedrooms, so up we went, with Mirei telling me to "be verrrry careful on the steps Nana; they are verrrry dangerous!" They have one long room on one side of the house which they will share eventually. Except for beds, it already looks settled, as Mirei has her stuffed animals, her tiny kitchen, a wee bench and her dolls on her side of the room. Riku has a bookcase with books and a neat array of small toys, plus a bench, Lego parts, and his dresser dividing the room at the moment. </p>
<p>On his window ledge was a small cup with neatly rolled pieces of paper in it, all for me. He had drawn some pictures and of course had his usual love note for me, with "Riku loves Nana" neatly written. He promised to draw me lots of pictures when I am here too, </p>
<p>I tucked Riku in fairly quickly, as both children were very tired from a late night the night before. Riku drifted off very fast, as he usually does, and was happy to have our familiar routine still holding ... a snuggle, a kiss goodnight, and then he rolls onto his left side, holding on to my hand. </p>
<p>Mirei, on the other hand, was not nearly so co-operative. It was harder for her to settle down, as she naps at her French nursery school, making it tough for her to go to bed as early as would be ideal. Instead of sleeping, she was lying beside me stroking Riku's hair and lacing her fingers through his; he was sound asleep, but I came downstairs and let Akane take over, hoping that would make it easier for this little girl to sleep. </p>
<p>By this time, it was close to 8:30, so I decided to settle in, unpack, and get organized, wanting to stay awake until a more reasonable bedtime for an adult. There is a very large shelving area in a cupboard in my room, but no hanging space (which is true throughout the house), but there was plenty of room to get my bag unpacked and tucked away on the base of that cupboard. I also pulled out the cream cheese, cheddar cheese, veggie "bacon", Acme sourdough bread, and the bagels, leaving the rest of the box and the blue bag for tomorrow. I made up the single futon, put the new cover on the duvet, and was tucked into bed at 11 P.M., twenty-six hours after waking in San Francisco yesterday. Off to bed. Yawn!</p>
