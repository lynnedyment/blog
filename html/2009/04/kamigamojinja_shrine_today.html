								<h2>Kamigamo-jinja Shrine Today</h2>
								<p>We had a nice slow easy morning with a leisurely breakfast, just hanging around for the house for the most part. I slept in for an extra hour, until 7 A.M. and needed it, and Bryn too slept in for the first time since I arrived, until 8 o'clock. His allergies have been so bad, and he's been working long hours, so it was good to know he was catching up a bit on his sleep. Riku and I read another chapter from "Phantom Toll Booth"; as Riku says each night, "We're getting there!" Riku did his reading from an English language storybook with his dad as well, so one less little chore to do when we got home later. </p>
<p>Then we were on our way; the day was hot already, at 11 A.M., as we headed for the bus stop. Akane took her bike so she could stop on the way home for groceries. The temple grounds were just perfect for the children. It is like a massive park with lots going on ... there was some fast horseback riding on a special track as we entered, lots of little places to explore, ancient wooden shrines scattered here and there, and a lovely long shaded pathway beside a fast running stream, which the children especially loved. They both found long wooden sticks to poke in the water, one of their favourite things to do, of course, and the adults enjoyed sitting on the rocks in the shade too. </p>
<p>I wandered off on my own for a bit and took lots of photos. Coming into the gates I noticed a wedding party coming in, which was so intriguing. The groom was French, but had on a traditional kimono, and I was able to join in with other photographers and take some great shots of them and their guests, in chic French outfits, and beautiful kimonos on the Japanese guests. And not long after that a second wedding party appeared. This was such fun as again I was able to join in with other folks taking photos, although at one point the couple was being photographed on a bridge, and no one except their photographer had joined them. I was there, and the groom noticed me with my camera, and said something to his bride so that she turned and gave me a lovely smile. The second shot I took will show her giving me the peace sign, something almost all Japanese children do when their picture is being taken. There was a lovely shot of cherry blossoms, and I took lots of the various wooden shrines, and their grass roofs as well. </p>
<p>It was time for lunch, and Akane suggested that we go to a Chinese restaurant about halfway home. It was fun, as we were sitting on a raised flat platform, shoes at the side on the floor, and the children both drawing as they always do while waiting for their meals to be served. They were both happy to be sitting and out of the sun too. Akane had to ask what vegetarian food they could give me, and I was very happy with my big tasty bowl of mixed vegetables with rice in a very tasty broth base. It wasn't soup, but more like a moist casserole dish, and my plan was to take half of it home for another meal. I didn't. Mirei once again impressed us with her ability to eat noodles while using adult sized chopsticks. She even attempted to pick up a croquette with them, and came close to succeeding! </p>
<p>Mirei and I came home on the bus together, Akane cycled off to pick up groceries, and Bryn and Riku went shopping for some Pokemon cards, after Riku spotted the newest neighbour's son with a pack of them. </p>
<p>Home for our usual routine of Riku reading to Bryn, piano for Riku, a short trip to the playground for Riku and Bryn, although Riku just wanted time at home, so it was a very fast trip there and back, then dinner, baths, and bed. Both children were asleep minutes after they were tucked in, Riku at 7:35 and Mirei perhaps five minutes later. Both Bryn and Akane were busy on their computers, so I went through some of the magazines I brought with me, wrote one or two very fast emails once Bryn headed up early to bed, and was in bed myself by 10:30!</p>
