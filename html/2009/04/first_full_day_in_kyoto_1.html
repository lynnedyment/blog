								<h2>First Full Day in Kyoto</h2>
								<p>The sun was shining through the rice-paper shaded windows when I woke at 6:15 today. I slept very, very well, and was awake when Riku burst into the room at 6:30. He snuggled right in with me, warming up his cold feet on my warm legs. Now I know how Doug feels! Today is the first school day for Riku, although he was there with his parents and Mrs. Goda yesterday for a first-day ceremony, and did go to his classroom and sit at his new desk. </p>
<p>It was a busy morning, as both children had to get ready for school, and Mirei and Akane were going to accompany us to Riku's school just in case there were instructions for Riku that Akane needed to know. It was very cold in the house, so the warm sun when we stepped outside was such a treat ... a perfect beginning to this day for Riku! </p>
<p>Mirei rode on Bryn's shoulders and I tried to pay attention to just how to get to Riku's school. It's a twenty minute walk at a normal pace, and I will describe the turns we make at some later date. The cherry trees I saw in the dusk on the way in last night were just lovely along the riverside, and many people smiled and bowed to us as we passed them by. We heard loud voices across the river, and Bryn explained to Riku that it sounded like grown men exercising before going into work.</p>
<p>The school is very large with several buildings in all. The many steps were lined with flowers in individual pots, which look as though the children last term may have planted. There is a huge outdoor area with a high fence along three sides, where a vigorous game of baseball was being played, and soccer at the other side. We walked around to Riku's area, where he stepped into a corridor and put on his new "indoor shoes", a lightweight basic tennis shoe.</p>
<p>He was very confident and walked right in, checking to see how the other children had hung their knapsacks on the side of their desks. There was no teacher in sight when we left him sitting in his seat, with his female seatmate. The children were all just sitting quietly at their desks when we left at 8:15. </p>
<p>Akane and Mirei left us halfway home to continue on to the bus for Mirei's school. Bryn and I came home; I made some breakfast, and then started in unpacking some clothes. I made neat stacks of them and now they are neatly lined up on the window sills in the children's rooms, while Bryn's and Akane's had to stay downstairs awaiting a dresser. </p>
<p>Bryn and I left to meet Riku at 11:15, as he has early dismissal for the next three days. The gate we had walked through this morning was closed, and so we headed off in a new direction and met Riku in a neat line of students, two by two, holding hands, with his teacher at the front of the line and a helper at the back. They were with us all the way to the main road, and we learned that they will do this for a couple of weeks until the children are more comfortable with finding their own way home. </p>
<p>Riku was full of stories on the way home: he liked his school, he liked the teacher, and the children are nice. So far, so good. </p>
<p>After lunch and some play time at home, Bryn and I headed off to a nearby playground, just four blocks from the house. Riku decided he would take his new school backpack with him, complete with the photo of Skylar from Starr King! His plan was to draw while we were there, something new and different for him. There was a serious baseball game going on when we arrived at the lower part of this big area, and a swing set, a sandbox, and a slide, on the upper area. </p>
<p>We sat on a bench near the sandbox, and he worked away completely engrossed in it. After a while some older boys from the sandbox came over to talk to us, trying out their English, and being so sweet with Riku. When they were ready to leave, I asked if I could take their photo, and they posed readily for me, making sure that Riku was included. I hope he sees them again, as he was quite pleased with their attention. </p>
<p>Bryn and Mirei joined us about 5 P.M. Mirei was her usual beaming self, telling me that she did cry at school, but was happy now! Bryn was running up and down the slide, so both children tried imitating him. Riku can get about halfway up but I bet it's not long before he makes it to the top. Bryn was balancing on the teeter totter, walking up and down, and encouraged Riku to do the same. He was nervous about it, but did it with more and more confidence each time. I know he likes knowing he can do these things, and just needs some assurance that he can. Mirei was wise enough to know she still needed a hand. Just wait 'til next year though! We all got a chuckle watching Bryn stand on one leg juggling on the teeter totter... that Bryn! The walk home was lovely, holding hands while noticing all the things on the way... a very tall grouping of bamboo, a private (we think) garden, complete with a tiny wooden house inside the iron railings, a tiny kitten decoration in a flower pot, etc. I took a photo of them all standing outside their new home. </p>
<p>Dinner was almost ready when we walked in and after eating I gave Mirei one of her tiny baby dolls, along with a cotton receiving blanket that was always on her pillow at nap time at our house. Riku played with the bulging green "Hulk" Doug found for him in Vermont, so they had some quiet time before their tub, Mirei's first in the house. They have all been showering, but of course it is easier for me to bath them. The tub is deep and stainless steel, and even though initially Mirei didn't want to bath, at the end of it she didn't want to get out! <br />
 <br />
Riku is going to start sleeping in my room tonight; there is lots of room for both of us on two futons.We read a "Henry and Mudge" book, new to us both, and found it hard not to drift off with him when I was tucking him in. </p>
<p>I did the usual email check, some blogging, Facebook time, and then bed at 10:30;  I'm getting lots of fresh air and exercise and sleeping like a baby.</p>
