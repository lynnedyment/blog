								<h2>A Long Day at Home and a Short Visit with Amelia</h2>
								<p>I spent much of today trying to clear off my desktop on the computer so that it is tidy when I leave for Ontario, but that means moving photos into my family tree site (and I get distracted by "hits' tempting me to go in and see if there is a connection for one of the "leaves" on our "branches") or placing photos into my blog entries, as often that is what stops me from"publishing" them. </p>
<p>Today I made a call to a 1-800 number in Font Hill to get a death date for my grandmother's second husband. All I knew yesterday was his first and last name, and that he was born in Scotland. I did an online search in the historical records in Ancestry.com and lucked out by finding a marriage certificate for his sister's wedding in Niagara Falls. She and my grandmother were best friends, so I recognized her first and last name. Voil√†! That gave me the birth place for her brother too. Candy remembered the year he and our grandmother were married; my cousin knew approximately when he died, but more importantly, knew where he was buried. My phone call verified where he was born and the exact date of his death. </p>
<p>All of this is like a giant puzzle that gets done one piece at a time; Gail and I work on it together and have had such fun doing it. The problem is often just trying to keep away from it, because we enjoy it so much. </p>
<p>I had hoped to see Amelia today and confirmed with Susan this morning that that would be fine. I wanted to get my hair cut, a fifteen minute session in Noe Valley, and so I packed up a snack bag for Amelia and we were at her school to pick her up at 3:40. Her little face was white and she looked tired out; I got a big smile when she spotted me, and after first saying she thought she would like to go home, she changed her mind and said she would like to go to a playground as I had suggested.</p>
<p>On the way to the hairdresser, we stopped to look at a lovely winter/Christmas display in a shop window, admiring the tiny "snow angel", and toboggan slide. We sat going through some Christmas crafts in a magazine for children for five minutes while we waited for my gal to be free, and Amelia told me she liked my hair when it was finished.  </p>
<p>I had promised Amelia that we would go into a couple of shops after that, and she and Doug admired the ornaments on the two trees set up in one of them, and two "yappy" dogs in another. She walked hand in hand with Doug and me until they stopped to look at the window again. Amelia had not wanted me to take her photo with a huge "Nutcracker" outside one of the stores, much to my surprise, as she has never refused before. So, I was happy to snap a couple of photos by the window.  </p>
<p>Once back to the car she decided against the playground and asked if we would take her home instead. Susan was delighted to see her, and said she had had a couple of late nights, and she wasn't surprised Amelia was ready for some downtime at the end of this long week.</p>
<p>We went right home, and Bryn was online. We chatted for a bit, and Bryn told me that Riku had made up a "to-do" list on his own! He has become very good at deciding for himself what needs doing and then doing it. I had heard last week that he often is upstairs in the morning before school practicing the piano, without a word from either of his parents. However, this is the first time that he has made a list; sounds like he's on his way to be a good little organizer! </p>
<p>I made big bowls of popcorn for both of us, and Doug and I went upstairs and watched the first two parts of "Billy Connolly's World Tour of Australia". Between shows I made up fruit bowls with the delicious strawberries, persimmons, grapes, and tiny oranges we have on hand. </p>
<p>Later on that evening, Bryn sent a photo of Mirei mailing her homemade card to Uncle Frank, and there was time for some IM chat with Bryn too. It's Saturday for them; Riku was busy with his Chinese tutor Xiao, and Bryn was busy keeping Mirei occupied with something other than keeping Riku and Xiao entertained.  :)   The children were busy making a fort in the living room, with lots of toys and blankets, but they took a few minutes out to go to the computer for a quick hello to me. </p>
<p>The box that we mailed to Japan late on Monday morning arrived at their house today! I chatted with Bryn for quite a while before I headed up to bed, a little later than I should have. </p>
