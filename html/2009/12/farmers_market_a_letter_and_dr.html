								<h2>Farmer's Market, a Letter & Drawing, and a Movie</h2>
								<p>Doug had a therapy session in Mill Valley this morning at 11, and he had some very entertaining new exercises to try. He was standing on a platform, which was hooked up to a computer, and had a screen in front of him. Then he was given some "games", one of which involved moving his body around, with feet together and flat, trying to keep a red worm inside a circle. It sure looked funny from my perspective but he did it three times and each time he improved. Another involved a Pac-Man-like game, in which he had to move the figure via weight shifting.  Doug is still worried about his vision not improving as quickly as he would like it to, but Ewa, his lovely and encouraging therapist, thinks he is coming along splendidly. She sent him home with new exercises to add to his others, so he figures he's up to working at them (or should be) for twenty minutes out of every hour. </p>
<p>We stopped in for burritos at "Lucinda's", a spot that both Doug and Bryn are very fond of. For some reason I am not much in the mood for burritos these days, but as soon as I walked in I changed my mind and ordered a cheese and black bean burrito, brown rice, with mild salsa, on a whole wheat tortilla. I had them cut it in half and now have half for tomorrow. It was delicious; very moist, and healthy too! </p>
<p>Doug and I went back to the nearby mall at Corte Madera, and strolled along having samples of all the wonderful produce currently in season. There were crisp red grapes, firm persimmons to eat like an apple (only $1.50 a pound), big pomegranates ($3–5), tea samples from southern China (very nice!), and to our surprise, huge organic red red strawberries ... grown in greenhouses in southern California where it is still quite hot, and only $10 for three overfilled pint baskets. We bought all of the above, as well as some of the freshest Medjol dates we have ever had, grown in the desert in California. Oh, and we had a spoonful of an incredibly good creme brulée. The fellow, who owns his own company, works out of San Francisco. We tried the marshmallow version and it was <strong>so</strong> good, we just had to buy one. How we will share this fairly remains to be seen. </p>
<p>Once home, we collected the mail, and, much to my delight, there was an envelope from Riku. He had told me there was "a surprise coming" and it did. He wrote a letter telling me how much he was enjoying his skateboard, and sent along a wonderful drawing of us having drinks together ... tea for me, and a cold drink for Riku, with a lovely big house nearby with wings, perhaps, a water fountain in the garden and lots of beautiful red and yellow flowers nearby. In the envelope were nine hand-drawn and carefully cut out hearts, which I attached to the drawing with double sided tape. I would not want to lose any of them, although the paper was a little too wide for our scanner so the ones along the bottom edge got cut off.  :(  </p>
<p>Riku wrote the address himself and the very long return address too, except for the last line. And of course he decorated the back of the envelope so very nicely for me too. </p>
<p>There were lots of emails in from Tessa and Caillie today; these two girls are keeping me busy but I'm happy to hear that they are also in touch with each other too. </p>
<p>Doug had won two free tickets to the latest and as yet-unreleased Robert DeNiro movie for tonight, but since it is first come-first seated, we had to leave the house at 5:30. It felt rushed to me, as we hadn't been home that long and I start to wind down about that time anyway. However, we found a good parking spot, I sat on the floor of the lobby to read for an hour, and we both thoroughly enjoyed the movie, called "Everyone is Fine".  It wasn't an upbeat movie, as I had expected it to be, but the acting was wonderful,  and it was a very touching film. </p>
<p>Home to emails from both Kelly and Gregg, wanting to know whether they could go ahead with the new furnace. Gregg leaves tomorrow for twelve days in Fiji, on a business trip, and Kelly will have to deal with being there for the installation on her own. </p>
<p>Cold cold night; even Doug was happy with the bed buddies warming the bed up so quickly! </p>
