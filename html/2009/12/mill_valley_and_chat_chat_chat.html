								<h2>Mill Valley, and Chat, Chat, Chat!</h2>
								<p>Doug had his physio' session today at noon in Mill Valley; it was a shorter session than usual, and Doug was given some new exercises to do once more. Today he gets to start crisscrossing his feet as he moves along a long stretch of hallway, and is to continue with the eye exercises as well, moving his head in various directions, sometimes with his eyes open and then repeating it all with his eyes closed. It is so funny to watch him at these, from my vantage point at the computer, as he looks so much like a bird. He has to stand with his feet together, and then move just his head from side to side, focusing on letters he has taped to the wall in front of him. And he has to bend and swoop too, and sometimes he tips over slightly as his brain tries to adjust to his new reality. Again though, his therapist is very pleased with his progression, and commented today on how fast he moved along out of the office to practice walking as straight as he could in the long hallway outside. Since Doug is still seeing double at times, she has suggested an appointment with an ophthalmologist to check things out with him. </p>
<p>We were hoping the Farmers' market in the nearby mall would be open today, as we wanted to get more of the wonderfully fresh figs we bought last week for both us, and for Uncle Frank too. When you have a hankering for something sweet, just one of these very soft figs does the trick! Alas, Thursday does not seem to be a day when it is in operation. </p>
<p>It was 1:30 and so we had a small lunch out, two different kinds of fish tacos for Doug and a small teriyaki tofu wrap for me. Kelly was crazy about these, when she was visiting with us each spring, but now there is only one World Wraps in the area, and it's in Corte Madera. It was my first one in years and a bargain at only $5.00. </p>
<p>We ran a couple of errands and I was more than ready for my cup of tea and a read on the sofa. I am getting very used to this lazy half hour or more mid-day. Lovely habit and I plan to continue with it. </p>
<p>Garry called through on Skype from Sweden today so I could say hello to his darling Freija, now a gorgeous sixteen-month-old. How she has changed in just a few short weeks. We had quite a lovely little session together, as I asked her where her Raggedy Ann was, she collected hers while I got mine and we waved them to each other. When I held mine up to my shoulder, Freija did the same. Adorable!  Freija just beamed away paying attention to what she was seeing on their computer screen. </p>
<p>Garry told me she loved the English version of "Itsy-Bitsy-Spider", so I sang that to her three times, while her daddy tickled her at the appropriate time, and then did an old standard of ours too: "Round and round a garden". Lots of smiles from this little girl before we said goodbye. Garry says her two favourite words right now are "Anna".. after her friend at daycare (and lots of people now get called that!), and "baby", meaning any child over the age of a few months apparently ... even three- and four-year-olds at airports! </p>
<p>How I wish I had snapped a photo of her on Skype while we were chatting! Next time ... </p>
<p>I talked to Beth for quite a while too, and heard lots of news about her two middle grandchildren, both of whom know the alphabet, and love to do puzzles and play Wii, and keep their Neena, Papa, and Auntie Carol laughing at their antics. It was good to hear Beth laughing as Paul heard today that his cancer is back and progressing and it was a blow to him, believing that he was in remission after aggressive chemo and radiation a few months ago. </p>
<p>Bryn called from Toronto with some wonderful news; he came first place in his swimming competition today for the back crawl. He has been getting up for his swim meets each weekday at 6 A.M. since school went back in the fall; he loves it, but it must be so gratifying to have all that hard work and early hours out of bed pay off for him! </p>
<p>Doug and I watched two more episodes of Billy Connolly in Ireland tonight, I always plan to watch just one of them, but this collection is only a half hour per segment and that time goes by much too quickly to just watch the one. Doug and I are both ready to head out to the British Isles again anytime at all! </p>
<p>We came home to an email from Bryn with a sweet pic' of Riku at school on a rainy Friday morning (for him). </p>
