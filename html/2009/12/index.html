								<h2><a href="/2009/12/a_visit_with_susan_and_finn.html">A Visit with Susan and Finn,</a></h2>
								<p>I had offered to have Finn this morning and was expecting to hear from Susan earlier, but Finn had decided he wanted to stay home and watch a rented movie instead. Susan was sure that wouldn't last long, but I didn't hear anything more. </p>
<p>And then, about noon, the door bell rang and Finn had his nose pushed against the glass, calling out "Hi Nana!" He and Susan had gone out, stopped to pick up some yummy food for us to eat together. There was a vegetarian croque monsieur (with mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, and a really earthy cheese), a high and light veggie quiche, a quiche Lorraine for Susan and Finn, and a lemon tart for dessert. Yum! </p>
<p>Finn, however, could not be talked into having a bite of any of the quiche, or the pistachios Susan opened for him (usually a sure thing), or the grapes I offered that he rarely refuses. He had his mind set on using the hose, but it was cold outside, Finn was coughing, and Susan hadn't planned to stay long as Finn needed his nap. He was furious with her for not giving in, and finally after much patience on Susan's part, it was obvious that he really just needed to sleep. </p>
<p>They went off, with Finn waving goodbye from the back seat of the car. Less than a half hour later Susan sent me a sweet photo of sleeping Finn. It's an interesting photo of him, as I can so clearly see what he might look like as a young teenager in his face. </p>
<p>About an hour later Doug left to go to a double feature movie. My five or so hours alone swept by too quickly, but I enjoyed the time and the evening with Doug too. We didn't watch a DVD tonight as Doug was movied out, but I got lots of computer related work done while I had Doug here with me.  </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/12/farmers_market_a_letter_and_dr.html">Farmer's Market, a Letter & Drawing, and a Movie</a></h2>
								<p>Doug had a therapy session in Mill Valley this morning at 11, and he had some very entertaining new exercises to try. He was standing on a platform, which was hooked up to a computer, and had a screen in front of him. Then he was given some "games", one of which involved moving his body around, with feet together and flat, trying to keep a red worm inside a circle. It sure looked funny from my perspective but he did it three times and each time he improved. Another involved a Pac-Man-like game, in which he had to move the figure via weight shifting.  Doug is still worried about his vision not improving as quickly as he would like it to, but Ewa, his lovely and encouraging therapist, thinks he is coming along splendidly. She sent him home with new exercises to add to his others, so he figures he's up to working at them (or should be) for twenty minutes out of every hour. </p>
<p>We stopped in for burritos at "Lucinda's", a spot that both Doug and Bryn are very fond of. For some reason I am not much in the mood for burritos these days, but as soon as I walked in I changed my mind and ordered a cheese and black bean burrito, brown rice, with mild salsa, on a whole wheat tortilla. I had them cut it in half and now have half for tomorrow. It was delicious; very moist, and healthy too! </p>
<p>Doug and I went back to the nearby mall at Corte Madera, and strolled along having samples of all the wonderful produce currently in season. There were crisp red grapes, firm persimmons to eat like an apple (only $1.50 a pound), big pomegranates ($3–5), tea samples from southern China (very nice!), and to our surprise, huge organic red red strawberries ... grown in greenhouses in southern California where it is still quite hot, and only $10 for three overfilled pint baskets. We bought all of the above, as well as some of the freshest Medjol dates we have ever had, grown in the desert in California. Oh, and we had a spoonful of an incredibly good creme brulée. The fellow, who owns his own company, works out of San Francisco. We tried the marshmallow version and it was <strong>so</strong> good, we just had to buy one. How we will share this fairly remains to be seen. </p>
<p>Once home, we collected the mail, and, much to my delight, there was an envelope from Riku. He had told me there was "a surprise coming" and it did. He wrote a letter telling me how much he was enjoying his skateboard, and sent along a wonderful drawing of us having drinks together ... tea for me, and a cold drink for Riku, with a lovely big house nearby with wings, perhaps, a water fountain in the garden and lots of beautiful red and yellow flowers nearby. In the envelope were nine hand-drawn and carefully cut out hearts, which I attached to the drawing with double sided tape. I would not want to lose any of them, although the paper was a little too wide for our scanner so the ones along the bottom edge got cut off.  :(  </p>
<p>Riku wrote the address himself and the very long return address too, except for the last line. And of course he decorated the back of the envelope so very nicely for me too. </p>
<p>There were lots of emails in from Tessa and Caillie today; these two girls are keeping me busy but I'm happy to hear that they are also in touch with each other too. </p>
<p>Doug had won two free tickets to the latest and as yet-unreleased Robert DeNiro movie for tonight, but since it is first come-first seated, we had to leave the house at 5:30. It felt rushed to me, as we hadn't been home that long and I start to wind down about that time anyway. However, we found a good parking spot, I sat on the floor of the lobby to read for an hour, and we both thoroughly enjoyed the movie, called "Everyone is Fine".  It wasn't an upbeat movie, as I had expected it to be, but the acting was wonderful,  and it was a very touching film. </p>
<p>Home to emails from both Kelly and Gregg, wanting to know whether they could go ahead with the new furnace. Gregg leaves tomorrow for twelve days in Fiji, on a business trip, and Kelly will have to deal with being there for the installation on her own. </p>
<p>Cold cold night; even Doug was happy with the bed buddies warming the bed up so quickly! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/12/a_long_day_at_home_and_a_short.html">A Long Day at Home and a Short Visit with Amelia</a></h2>
								<p>I spent much of today trying to clear off my desktop on the computer so that it is tidy when I leave for Ontario, but that means moving photos into my family tree site (and I get distracted by "hits' tempting me to go in and see if there is a connection for one of the "leaves" on our "branches") or placing photos into my blog entries, as often that is what stops me from"publishing" them. </p>
<p>Today I made a call to a 1-800 number in Font Hill to get a death date for my grandmother's second husband. All I knew yesterday was his first and last name, and that he was born in Scotland. I did an online search in the historical records in Ancestry.com and lucked out by finding a marriage certificate for his sister's wedding in Niagara Falls. She and my grandmother were best friends, so I recognized her first and last name. Voilà! That gave me the birth place for her brother too. Candy remembered the year he and our grandmother were married; my cousin knew approximately when he died, but more importantly, knew where he was buried. My phone call verified where he was born and the exact date of his death. </p>
<p>All of this is like a giant puzzle that gets done one piece at a time; Gail and I work on it together and have had such fun doing it. The problem is often just trying to keep away from it, because we enjoy it so much. </p>
<p>I had hoped to see Amelia today and confirmed with Susan this morning that that would be fine. I wanted to get my hair cut, a fifteen minute session in Noe Valley, and so I packed up a snack bag for Amelia and we were at her school to pick her up at 3:40. Her little face was white and she looked tired out; I got a big smile when she spotted me, and after first saying she thought she would like to go home, she changed her mind and said she would like to go to a playground as I had suggested.</p>
<p>On the way to the hairdresser, we stopped to look at a lovely winter/Christmas display in a shop window, admiring the tiny "snow angel", and toboggan slide. We sat going through some Christmas crafts in a magazine for children for five minutes while we waited for my gal to be free, and Amelia told me she liked my hair when it was finished.  </p>
<p>I had promised Amelia that we would go into a couple of shops after that, and she and Doug admired the ornaments on the two trees set up in one of them, and two "yappy" dogs in another. She walked hand in hand with Doug and me until they stopped to look at the window again. Amelia had not wanted me to take her photo with a huge "Nutcracker" outside one of the stores, much to my surprise, as she has never refused before. So, I was happy to snap a couple of photos by the window.  </p>
<p>Once back to the car she decided against the playground and asked if we would take her home instead. Susan was delighted to see her, and said she had had a couple of late nights, and she wasn't surprised Amelia was ready for some downtime at the end of this long week.</p>
<p>We went right home, and Bryn was online. We chatted for a bit, and Bryn told me that Riku had made up a "to-do" list on his own! He has become very good at deciding for himself what needs doing and then doing it. I had heard last week that he often is upstairs in the morning before school practicing the piano, without a word from either of his parents. However, this is the first time that he has made a list; sounds like he's on his way to be a good little organizer! </p>
<p>I made big bowls of popcorn for both of us, and Doug and I went upstairs and watched the first two parts of "Billy Connolly's World Tour of Australia". Between shows I made up fruit bowls with the delicious strawberries, persimmons, grapes, and tiny oranges we have on hand. </p>
<p>Later on that evening, Bryn sent a photo of Mirei mailing her homemade card to Uncle Frank, and there was time for some IM chat with Bryn too. It's Saturday for them; Riku was busy with his Chinese tutor Xiao, and Bryn was busy keeping Mirei occupied with something other than keeping Riku and Xiao entertained.  :)   The children were busy making a fort in the living room, with lots of toys and blankets, but they took a few minutes out to go to the computer for a quick hello to me. </p>
<p>The box that we mailed to Japan late on Monday morning arrived at their house today! I chatted with Bryn for quite a while before I headed up to bed, a little later than I should have. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/12/morning_movie.html">Cold  San Francisco, Morning Movie, and Home</a></h2>
								<p>It has been so cold here in the mornings, with the temp down to 60ºF in the house again this morning. However, big storms are supposed to be coming in on Monday and continuing for four days, so I must just enjoy this dry weather until then. </p>
<p>Doug had managed to get two free tickets to a movie at an "Almost British and Australian Film Festival". So, at 19:45 we were at the Vogue cinema waiting to see an Australian film called "Disgrace". About a half hour into the movie I realized I had read the book by J.M. Coetzee! The movie was very true to the book, which meant it was quite intense and rather depressing too. Well acted though, with John Malkovitch and a female star whose name I didn't recognize. We bought a refillable bag of popcorn for $6.50, justified (by me) by that being cheaper than we could buy lunch after 1 o'clock, when we would be very hungry. We haven't bought popcorn in the theatre for a while now, so this made me very happy. </p>
<p>We ran some errands on the way home, stopping in at the very crowded Costco, and Trader Joe's, but found Rainbow Grocery unusually quiet. </p>
<p>Home to lots of messages ... lovely iPhone pics from Susan of Amelia at a riding lesson (she looks right at home up there!), Finn busy with a car in dirt keeping himself very busy (as one can see from his look of concentration), and some great tree-climbing photos too. Rains are expected on Monday so this is a good weekend to get outdoors. </p>
<p>And there were messages from Bryn, as well as an IM note, with their plans for next summer. These include Bryn here with Mirei in July, and then Riku here on his own for August while his parents and sister go to France for four weeks. </p>
<p>Bryn sent photos too: one of Riku eating his morning fruit bowl, and I noticed he had double layers on ... Bryn told me he's double-layed on the bottom too. Brr-r-r. I will have to buy myself some long underwear before I go there in February! He sent one of Riku mailing a letter, which made me smile: such a funny look on his face. </p>
<p>They were all going to a huge bowling alley not far from their home this afternoon, part of a community gathering so as to get to know each other a little better. I am waiting to see those photos. I did get one of Mirei moving along mighty fast; a great photo! </p>
<p>Doug and I weren't hungry after the popcorn at the movie and samples at Costco, so I made up fruit bowls for us ... mine was my dinner, and Doug had a small burrito too. I wanted some extra time for working on my desktop and putting photos into the right places, so we watched only one Billy Connolly in Australia segment tonight. </p>
<p>Kelly called and she and Doug had a long chat while I typed away. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/12/christmas_cards.html">Christmas Cards</a></h2>
								<p>Today Doug and I finished up the last of our Christmas cards. For all but two of our forty-four years together, we have sat down together to write and address our cards. Doug mentioned tonight that we may well be in the last generation that has this ritual, as so many people now either don't bother with cards at all, or send E-cards out instead. I certainly will miss the cards spread out along the mantle when no one bothers any more. </p>
<p>So, continuing on with our tradition, today we put on the Christmas music in the background, spread out all the cards we have, and name by name go down the list, choose the appropriate card, I write the card, and Doug writes the address. When it comes to a friend who is more Doug's friend that mine, then he will often write the card, and do the envelope, while I write longer notes in a few of the others. </p>
<p>I had done some cards on my own when Doug was in B.C. as I didn't want to be rushing through them once he got home. He also was having trouble with close work when he left, so it made sense for me to go through the list and take care of any requiring an annual update, generally to those in the family who are without computers. </p>
<p>It took us only an hour and a half to finish up, and we mailed off the first lot for overseas and to Vancouver Island. Mid-week we will send off the Canadian cards and then the U.S. shortly after that. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/12/vacaville.html">Vacaville</a></h2>
								<p>Doug and I used to go to the outlet mall in Vacaville quite frequently, in the years we were buying clothes for the children here and in Toronto. But for the past couple of years we have gone perhaps twice a year, and often when visitors are here. But I needed some footed sleeper blankets for Mirei and a few extra little gifts to take back east, so today was the day for that outing. </p>
<p>The last time we were there, in early November, Doug had his vestibular "accident" and we didn't do any shopping at all. Walking into Fresh Choice for lunch, I know that was on both our minds. Doug commented on the way out after lunch, that the last time he had to be helped to the car by two strong men. He knows he has come a long way since then, but is still anxious to be feeling the way he was two months ago! </p>
<p>We both enjoyed our big healthy lunches today; I couldn't decide between the always delicious butternut squash soup and the corn with green chili soup, so had both. We both enjoyed the roasted fingerling potatoes, and I had them on a side dish, along with a little mac' n' cheese, a small slice of pizza, and my favourite muffin of all ... a corn muffin. That completed my carbs portion. </p>
<p>After that we were well fueled up for browsing among the various sections of the malls. I got everything on my list except for stocking up on birthday/anniversary cards; there used to be a wonderful card and paper shop, but now there is only a very small outlet store with very little selection. </p>
<p>We stopped in at both Costco and at Trader Joe's on the way home, and then enjoyed a long quiet evening here, with a break to watch Billy Connolly touring Australia, always rollicking good fun.</p>
<p>Oh yes, after those hearty lunches we had a bowl of fresh fruit and yogurt for our dinner. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/12/finn_here.html">Brr-r-r! ... and a Visit with Finn</a></h2>
								<p>Finn was over for a visit this morning, and he and Susan were both chilled when they arrived at the house. Susan mentioned how warm the house was, as they have no central heating at their place, and the two space heaters don't keep the flat quite as warm as would be ideal during this cold spell we're having right now. Finn's little hands were so cold and he didn't want to take his cozy polar fleece off until he had been here for over half an hour. </p>
<p>Finn instantly carried out the big six-quart basket of assorted cars once Susan left. I so wish I had snapped a photo of him lining the little Tonka-style cars up all along the edge of the laundry room door. Riku did exactly the same thing, although usually on the bed. Finn had them lined up perfectly, fronts of the cars against the door, and tucked in closely beside one another.</p>
<p>He asked if he could play upstairs today, so off we went. I plugged in the iron and got all that done up as Finn sat on the floor with the big blocks, the race track, the balls in the holes game, and the cars too. I laughed as several times today he would come out with "Oh, <strong>man</strong>!" and proceed to do whatever it was that he was doing. </p>
<p>Finn wanted to play with the Lincoln Log set, so after tiding up together, and singing the "clean up" song, out came the logs. And Doug walked in at the perfect moment, as I am not a house builder at all, and Doug sat with Finn on the floor and built a fine little house. Finn had a great time with it, closing off the door with a "big stick" and putting a little boy figure inside; very entertaining for him! </p>
<p>I sang a few songs to him as I ironed; he liked the "current buns" song, and stopped to watch me sway back and forth as I sang "Did you ever see a lassie?" He told me he didn't know <strong>that</strong> song and asked me to sing it three times. The ironing disappeared in no time, and Finn sat beside me on the bed and watched me sew a button on a shirt too. Nice to have these jobs out of the way and Finn still got lots of attention too. </p>
<p>At one point he heard a siren and so I stood him on top of the dresser until we spotted it and watched it travelling along Potrero Avenue. </p>
<p>It was lunch time so I made grilled cheese sandwiches and sat with him while he played with the "lock board", having great fun with the keys and seeing the pictures inside once we got the locks undone. He used the peg board too, although lost interest in it pretty quickly, returning to the locks instead. </p>
<p>We had one of our favourite "Get those feet off my table(!) moments too which made Finn giggle away. </p>
<p>He was ready for his nap just as Susan came in, but took the time to go upstairs with his mom and show her his house. Susan sent a message later saying Finn was asleep twenty minutes after they left. </p>
<p>It's cold everywhere! Bryn sent a photo of Riku in three layers walking to school on this cold-in-Japan-too morning. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched the last of Billy Connolly's World Tour of Australia last night and we're looking forward to the next set. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/12/decorating_a_tree.html">Decorating a Tree!</a></h2>
								<p>Susan, knowing how much I enjoy decorating Christmas trees (I had mentioned this to her the other day, lamenting not having one to decorate here, and hoping I would be helping with the one in Toronto), kindly invited me over to help with theirs today! They bought a lovely slim tall tree from the local lot on Sunday, getting it home on the children's big wagon, and now it had fallen and was ready for some attention. </p>
<p>I arrived about 4:30; Sheena and Amelia had done their homework, so we set about untangling the lights and getting the decorations out of the boxes. Susan took care of the lights, with a little help from Amelia and me, and the twinkling tiny white lights were lovely once she had all four sets on. She went off to bath Finn, and the girls decided to have some play time. Susan put on some lovely Christmas music, and  I very happily took my time and hung up each ornament in the perfect spot. Amelia and Sheena came in to help with their favourite glittery openwork stars, and all the soft fabric ornaments as well. </p>
<p>Susan had ordered four pizzas from Amici's for dinner, as well as a big salad, and invited Sheena's mom, Katherine, her partner Greg, and Sheena to stay for dinner. The British Isles were well represented, as Katherine hails from Ireland and Greg from the southwest coast of England. I sat reveling in the accents! They're both lovely friendly people. The pizza was as good as always, the company "brilliant", and the wine delicious. Kevin was with us too, and it was just a grand time sitting and relaxing 'round the table, while the children played happily in Amelia's room. Cheesecake topped off this dinner ... delicious! </p>
<p>I got home about 8:30, and Doug and I went upstairs to watch one segment of Billy Connolly's tour of Ireland ... such good timing, and it just reminded us of how we would love to go back to that lovely green isle. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/12/mill_valley_and_chat_chat_chat.html">Mill Valley, and Chat, Chat, Chat!</a></h2>
								<p>Doug had his physio' session today at noon in Mill Valley; it was a shorter session than usual, and Doug was given some new exercises to do once more. Today he gets to start crisscrossing his feet as he moves along a long stretch of hallway, and is to continue with the eye exercises as well, moving his head in various directions, sometimes with his eyes open and then repeating it all with his eyes closed. It is so funny to watch him at these, from my vantage point at the computer, as he looks so much like a bird. He has to stand with his feet together, and then move just his head from side to side, focusing on letters he has taped to the wall in front of him. And he has to bend and swoop too, and sometimes he tips over slightly as his brain tries to adjust to his new reality. Again though, his therapist is very pleased with his progression, and commented today on how fast he moved along out of the office to practice walking as straight as he could in the long hallway outside. Since Doug is still seeing double at times, she has suggested an appointment with an ophthalmologist to check things out with him. </p>
<p>We were hoping the Farmers' market in the nearby mall would be open today, as we wanted to get more of the wonderfully fresh figs we bought last week for both us, and for Uncle Frank too. When you have a hankering for something sweet, just one of these very soft figs does the trick! Alas, Thursday does not seem to be a day when it is in operation. </p>
<p>It was 1:30 and so we had a small lunch out, two different kinds of fish tacos for Doug and a small teriyaki tofu wrap for me. Kelly was crazy about these, when she was visiting with us each spring, but now there is only one World Wraps in the area, and it's in Corte Madera. It was my first one in years and a bargain at only $5.00. </p>
<p>We ran a couple of errands and I was more than ready for my cup of tea and a read on the sofa. I am getting very used to this lazy half hour or more mid-day. Lovely habit and I plan to continue with it. </p>
<p>Garry called through on Skype from Sweden today so I could say hello to his darling Freija, now a gorgeous sixteen-month-old. How she has changed in just a few short weeks. We had quite a lovely little session together, as I asked her where her Raggedy Ann was, she collected hers while I got mine and we waved them to each other. When I held mine up to my shoulder, Freija did the same. Adorable!  Freija just beamed away paying attention to what she was seeing on their computer screen. </p>
<p>Garry told me she loved the English version of "Itsy-Bitsy-Spider", so I sang that to her three times, while her daddy tickled her at the appropriate time, and then did an old standard of ours too: "Round and round a garden". Lots of smiles from this little girl before we said goodbye. Garry says her two favourite words right now are "Anna".. after her friend at daycare (and lots of people now get called that!), and "baby", meaning any child over the age of a few months apparently ... even three- and four-year-olds at airports! </p>
<p>How I wish I had snapped a photo of her on Skype while we were chatting! Next time ... </p>
<p>I talked to Beth for quite a while too, and heard lots of news about her two middle grandchildren, both of whom know the alphabet, and love to do puzzles and play Wii, and keep their Neena, Papa, and Auntie Carol laughing at their antics. It was good to hear Beth laughing as Paul heard today that his cancer is back and progressing and it was a blow to him, believing that he was in remission after aggressive chemo and radiation a few months ago. </p>
<p>Bryn called from Toronto with some wonderful news; he came first place in his swimming competition today for the back crawl. He has been getting up for his swim meets each weekday at 6 A.M. since school went back in the fall; he loves it, but it must be so gratifying to have all that hard work and early hours out of bed pay off for him! </p>
<p>Doug and I watched two more episodes of Billy Connolly in Ireland tonight, I always plan to watch just one of them, but this collection is only a half hour per segment and that time goes by much too quickly to just watch the one. Doug and I are both ready to head out to the British Isles again anytime at all! </p>
<p>We came home to an email from Bryn with a sweet pic' of Riku at school on a rainy Friday morning (for him). </p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/12/rainy_rainy_day.html">Rainy, Rainy day ... and a Long Chat with Mirei</a></h2>
								<p>The house was a balmy 63ºF this morning, much nicer than the 56º and 58ºs of the past few days. And along with that higher temperature came the fog, with sprinkles, in the morning and a heavy downpour in the afternoon. It was loud and constant and just wonderful actually, as we need a good soak and all the plants need water. </p>
<p>Susan brightened up the morning by sending me a photos of Finn out enjoying his day with some puddle time, and a sweet one of him walking along a long, wide, leaf-lined pathway.</p>
<p>Bryn sent an IM telling me, amongst other things, that Mirei had told him she missed her Nana, after seeing my photo on the side of their fridge. Riku and Akane had already left to see a just-released movie that started at 8:30 A.M. in downtown Kyoto! What a great idea to have early morning movies for children! </p>
<p>Bryn and Mirei were going out to do a little Christmas shopping together and to look at all the decorations, but there was time for a nice long conversation with Mirei on Skype. What would I do without it? It was such a treat to sit and listen to all her news. The first thing Mirei told Doug when he answered the Skype video call was all about their Christmas tree. They bought a large potted tree, and plan to decorate it this weekend. It will be lovely all lit up and glowing. </p>
<p>They had opened the box we sent and I could see the window decorations on the hutch doors, and Mirei went over to the little Christmas village and clapped her hands to make it light up. Bryn hadn't realized it also played music so Riku will be thrilled to see it too when he gets home. Bryn had read two of the Christmas stories to Mirei and she brought the book over to the computer to show me the beautiful tree in the mouse pop-up book that she loved so much last year. </p>
<p>The highlight of the phone call was Mirei singing to me. I had started to sing "Santa Claus is Coming to Town" to her but she interrupted to tell me that was too long and she would sing to me instead. Hers was a mixed rendition of that song, as well as a reference to Hallowe'en and the mean Santa who died, and the other Santa who was good and didn't die, and bits and pieces of details about school, and more! Her little head was bobbing from side to side, and you could see that little mind running ahead to think of what was going to come next! I just sat there grinning away listening to her and how I wished I could have recorded it. That would have had her howling one day in the far future! </p>
<p>I could have sat there for a long time, just looking at her animated face, but eventually they had to get on with their day, and we had to run to the bank to deposit some cheques for her dad. So we blew kisses and said our goodbyes, with Mirei ending the call by saying "Bye Nana! Talk to you tomorrow on the computer!" </p>
<p>I hadn't heard from Uncle Frank in many days and despite email messages to him, there was only silence from his end. This always worries me and so I called him, and discovered that he had not been feeling that great — tummy problems — and had been sleeping quite a bit so as not to be any more aware of how wretched he felt. He was right in the midst of writing to me, with dinner a half hour away, so we hung up so he could continue writing me about his week. He sounded pretty good, and we will talk again tomorrow, on his 90th birthday! </p>
<p>It wasn't much fun driving in the heavy rain, but it was lovely and mild and so a treat not to be bundled up against the cold. Doug ran a couple of errands while I sat in the car reading a page-turning Canadian mystery novel set in a small village in Quebec. The author has a way with words and both of us sit drooling when the food is described: flaky tender croissants, melted Brie with roasted vegetables on a warm fresh baguette, cream of pumpkin soup with a drizzle of maple syrup for garnish, wine in big glasses, Drambuie in crystal, sugar pie, freshly baked brownies, and big chunky cookies, warm from the oven, for desserts and treats. If only the village weren't imaginary; we would be moving on out of here! </p>
<p>I came home to Uncle Frank's lovely email which he continued after he had been downstairs for his dinner. That made me feel better!</p>
<p>Doug and I had a comforting bowl of pasta with fresh tomatoes (with sauteed spinach added to mine), and sat eating with warm bowls in hand as we watched Billy Connolly make his way across England. Surprisingly, he devoted most of one of the two segments that we watched to Newcastle-on-Tyne in the northeastern part of England, with its many bridges. This was most interesting to me as Gail and I have done enough research on the family to know that many of our ancestors came from Newcastle and surrounding area. It's now a huge city and quite lovely too, quite evolved from its mostly-coal-mining past. </p>
<p>I worked on the family tree quite a bit this evening, as I not only got in some photos from a new contact, but also discovered duplicates in my tree in that line. What a mess it will be straightening that up, but I don't think it will be done until late next month. </p>
<p>Off to bed at 11, not quite so anxious tonight to get those bed buddies in warming up the cold sheets.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2009/12/it_rained_and_it_poured.html">It Rained and It Poured... and Happy 90th Birthday to Uncle Frank!</a></h2>
								<p>Uncle Frank turned ninety today. It's been an interesting past two weeks with him, as several times during that period he had mentioned to me that his big day was coming, or that it was only so many days until the "Big 90!". For all the years that Uncle Frank has been in my life, and that has been since I was ten months old, he has never discussed his age with me, or with anyone else. One of his sons had no idea what year he was born, and daren't ask either. I did know that, but certainly never discussed it with him, as he felt his age was a private matter and no one else should feel they had the right to know. But, I think he is very proud of having reached this day, and why not? It's a day to celebrate for sure! He told me two days before his birthday that was was "proud of my first 90 years" and was looking forward to the next ones. His own Uncle Frank lived to be 101, and I'm betting my money on this one to do the same. </p>
<p>What a blustery day this turned out to be! The sky was heavy with black clouds for most of the day, and once in a while the sun shone through, all looked well, and then within fifteen minutes we couldn't see out the front window across the street. This went on several times over the course of the day and the evening too. </p>
<p>I typed away with Bryn for a while this morning, as he was at Mirei's French school helping to set up for her Christmas party there. He sent a short video of the children running around in the big auditorium beforehand, and we spotted Akane, her mom, and her sister too, who had arrived last night at 10 P.M. so they could attend the concert. </p>
<p>Bryn had surprised us last night with an email with "gift money" for us. He wanted to treat us to his favourite spot for "chips"... aka "French fries", before it closes for good on the 19th of this month. Doug suggested that we have lunch there, and then do a run to the post office, so off we went. I was driving and it was certainly raining hard, but only when we finally parked the car, a long block and a half away, did the skies just open up and pour down on us. There were massive puddles everywhere, we had to hop over wide stretches in the sidewalks where the water was inches deep, and by the time we reached the  front door of "South" we were both soaked, despite our rain jackets! </p>
<p>And to add insult to injury, the restaurant is only open for dinner on the weekends! We stood dripping for a minute before heading off into the deluge again. My fabric purse was soaked all the way through, and both of us were drenched from the hems of our jackets down. Doug got a soaker, and I just felt wet and chilly. </p>
<p>We had to go to the bank, but I knew the underground parking area would be jam-packed, and of course it was ... worse than I have ever seen it before. Water was dripping down from the roof above, horns were honking as people vied for spots, and four of the usual spots were so deep in water that no one could park there. I lucked out and found a spot finally, and by the time we got up to ground level, there was the sun shining through again! Exciting times! </p>
<p>Bryn had sent enough money that we could also splurge on his favourite falafil (as the restaurant "Old Jerusalem" spells it), so off we went to do a pick-up. Doug wasn't sure about the eggplant that is part of their falafil sandwich, and I was surprised to see them served like a very long burrito ... a first for us, but we took them home, heated them up, and thoroughly enjoyed them ... sitting upstairs with the storm raging 'round us, watching as Billy Connolly toured around England and Wales, completely bypassing Liverpool! For heaven's sake! How could he? Again though, after seeing again how beautiful it all is, we are both just keen to get back to the British Isles and spend a long while there. </p>
<p>Thank you, Bryn! I'm looking forward to those chips at Monday lunch.  </p>
<p>p.s. I did call Uncle Frank this evening but Glenn and Wendy were visiting with him, he had been out for lunch with his sons, his daughter-in-law and two of his three grandchildren, and also had a visit with Sheldon and Donna after dinner. More is coming up tomorrow for him. He sounded very pleased with his day! </p>
