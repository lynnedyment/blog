								<h2>Cold  San Francisco, Morning Movie, and Home</h2>
								<p>It has been so cold here in the mornings, with the temp down to 60ÂºF in the house again this morning. However, big storms are supposed to be coming in on Monday and continuing for four days, so I must just enjoy this dry weather until then. </p>
<p>Doug had managed to get two free tickets to a movie at an "Almost British and Australian Film Festival". So, at 19:45 we were at the Vogue cinema waiting to see an Australian film called "Disgrace". About a half hour into the movie I realized I had read the book by J.M. Coetzee! The movie was very true to the book, which meant it was quite intense and rather depressing too. Well acted though, with John Malkovitch and a female star whose name I didn't recognize. We bought a refillable bag of popcorn for $6.50, justified (by me) by that being cheaper than we could buy lunch after 1 o'clock, when we would be very hungry. We haven't bought popcorn in the theatre for a while now, so this made me very happy. </p>
<p>We ran some errands on the way home, stopping in at the very crowded Costco, and Trader Joe's, but found Rainbow Grocery unusually quiet. </p>
<p>Home to lots of messages ... lovely iPhone pics from Susan of Amelia at a riding lesson (she looks right at home up there!), Finn busy with a car in dirt keeping himself very busy (as one can see from his look of concentration), and some great tree-climbing photos too. Rains are expected on Monday so this is a good weekend to get outdoors. </p>
<p>And there were messages from Bryn, as well as an IM note, with their plans for next summer. These include Bryn here with Mirei in July, and then Riku here on his own for August while his parents and sister go to France for four weeks. </p>
<p>Bryn sent photos too: one of Riku eating his morning fruit bowl, and I noticed he had double layers on ... Bryn told me he's double-layed on the bottom too. Brr-r-r. I will have to buy myself some long underwear before I go there in February! He sent one of Riku mailing a letter, which made me smile: such a funny look on his face. </p>
<p>They were all going to a huge bowling alley not far from their home this afternoon, part of a community gathering so as to get to know each other a little better. I am waiting to see those photos. I did get one of Mirei moving along mighty fast; a great photo! </p>
<p>Doug and I weren't hungry after the popcorn at the movie and samples at Costco, so I made up fruit bowls for us ... mine was my dinner, and Doug had a small burrito too. I wanted some extra time for working on my desktop and putting photos into the right places, so we watched only one Billy Connolly in Australia segment tonight. </p>
<p>Kelly called and she and Doug had a long chat while I typed away. </p>
