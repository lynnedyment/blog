								<h2>Rainy, Rainy day ... and a Long Chat with Mirei</h2>
								<p>The house was a balmy 63ºF this morning, much nicer than the 56º and 58ºs of the past few days. And along with that higher temperature came the fog, with sprinkles, in the morning and a heavy downpour in the afternoon. It was loud and constant and just wonderful actually, as we need a good soak and all the plants need water. </p>
<p>Susan brightened up the morning by sending me a photos of Finn out enjoying his day with some puddle time, and a sweet one of him walking along a long, wide, leaf-lined pathway.</p>
<p>Bryn sent an IM telling me, amongst other things, that Mirei had told him she missed her Nana, after seeing my photo on the side of their fridge. Riku and Akane had already left to see a just-released movie that started at 8:30 A.M. in downtown Kyoto! What a great idea to have early morning movies for children! </p>
<p>Bryn and Mirei were going out to do a little Christmas shopping together and to look at all the decorations, but there was time for a nice long conversation with Mirei on Skype. What would I do without it? It was such a treat to sit and listen to all her news. The first thing Mirei told Doug when he answered the Skype video call was all about their Christmas tree. They bought a large potted tree, and plan to decorate it this weekend. It will be lovely all lit up and glowing. </p>
<p>They had opened the box we sent and I could see the window decorations on the hutch doors, and Mirei went over to the little Christmas village and clapped her hands to make it light up. Bryn hadn't realized it also played music so Riku will be thrilled to see it too when he gets home. Bryn had read two of the Christmas stories to Mirei and she brought the book over to the computer to show me the beautiful tree in the mouse pop-up book that she loved so much last year. </p>
<p>The highlight of the phone call was Mirei singing to me. I had started to sing "Santa Claus is Coming to Town" to her but she interrupted to tell me that was too long and she would sing to me instead. Hers was a mixed rendition of that song, as well as a reference to Hallowe'en and the mean Santa who died, and the other Santa who was good and didn't die, and bits and pieces of details about school, and more! Her little head was bobbing from side to side, and you could see that little mind running ahead to think of what was going to come next! I just sat there grinning away listening to her and how I wished I could have recorded it. That would have had her howling one day in the far future! </p>
<p>I could have sat there for a long time, just looking at her animated face, but eventually they had to get on with their day, and we had to run to the bank to deposit some cheques for her dad. So we blew kisses and said our goodbyes, with Mirei ending the call by saying "Bye Nana! Talk to you tomorrow on the computer!" </p>
<p>I hadn't heard from Uncle Frank in many days and despite email messages to him, there was only silence from his end. This always worries me and so I called him, and discovered that he had not been feeling that great — tummy problems — and had been sleeping quite a bit so as not to be any more aware of how wretched he felt. He was right in the midst of writing to me, with dinner a half hour away, so we hung up so he could continue writing me about his week. He sounded pretty good, and we will talk again tomorrow, on his 90th birthday! </p>
<p>It wasn't much fun driving in the heavy rain, but it was lovely and mild and so a treat not to be bundled up against the cold. Doug ran a couple of errands while I sat in the car reading a page-turning Canadian mystery novel set in a small village in Quebec. The author has a way with words and both of us sit drooling when the food is described: flaky tender croissants, melted Brie with roasted vegetables on a warm fresh baguette, cream of pumpkin soup with a drizzle of maple syrup for garnish, wine in big glasses, Drambuie in crystal, sugar pie, freshly baked brownies, and big chunky cookies, warm from the oven, for desserts and treats. If only the village weren't imaginary; we would be moving on out of here! </p>
<p>I came home to Uncle Frank's lovely email which he continued after he had been downstairs for his dinner. That made me feel better!</p>
<p>Doug and I had a comforting bowl of pasta with fresh tomatoes (with sauteed spinach added to mine), and sat eating with warm bowls in hand as we watched Billy Connolly make his way across England. Surprisingly, he devoted most of one of the two segments that we watched to Newcastle-on-Tyne in the northeastern part of England, with its many bridges. This was most interesting to me as Gail and I have done enough research on the family to know that many of our ancestors came from Newcastle and surrounding area. It's now a huge city and quite lovely too, quite evolved from its mostly-coal-mining past. </p>
<p>I worked on the family tree quite a bit this evening, as I not only got in some photos from a new contact, but also discovered duplicates in my tree in that line. What a mess it will be straightening that up, but I don't think it will be done until late next month. </p>
<p>Off to bed at 11, not quite so anxious tonight to get those bed buddies in warming up the cold sheets.</p>
