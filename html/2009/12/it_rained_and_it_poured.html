								<h2>It Rained and It Poured... and Happy 90th Birthday to Uncle Frank!</h2>
								<p>Uncle Frank turned ninety today. It's been an interesting past two weeks with him, as several times during that period he had mentioned to me that his big day was coming, or that it was only so many days until the "Big 90!". For all the years that Uncle Frank has been in my life, and that has been since I was ten months old, he has never discussed his age with me, or with anyone else. One of his sons had no idea what year he was born, and daren't ask either. I did know that, but certainly never discussed it with him, as he felt his age was a private matter and no one else should feel they had the right to know. But, I think he is very proud of having reached this day, and why not? It's a day to celebrate for sure! He told me two days before his birthday that was was "proud of my first 90 years" and was looking forward to the next ones. His own Uncle Frank lived to be 101, and I'm betting my money on this one to do the same. </p>
<p>What a blustery day this turned out to be! The sky was heavy with black clouds for most of the day, and once in a while the sun shone through, all looked well, and then within fifteen minutes we couldn't see out the front window across the street. This went on several times over the course of the day and the evening too. </p>
<p>I typed away with Bryn for a while this morning, as he was at Mirei's French school helping to set up for her Christmas party there. He sent a short video of the children running around in the big auditorium beforehand, and we spotted Akane, her mom, and her sister too, who had arrived last night at 10 P.M. so they could attend the concert. </p>
<p>Bryn had surprised us last night with an email with "gift money" for us. He wanted to treat us to his favourite spot for "chips"... aka "French fries", before it closes for good on the 19th of this month. Doug suggested that we have lunch there, and then do a run to the post office, so off we went. I was driving and it was certainly raining hard, but only when we finally parked the car, a long block and a half away, did the skies just open up and pour down on us. There were massive puddles everywhere, we had to hop over wide stretches in the sidewalks where the water was inches deep, and by the time we reached the  front door of "South" we were both soaked, despite our rain jackets! </p>
<p>And to add insult to injury, the restaurant is only open for dinner on the weekends! We stood dripping for a minute before heading off into the deluge again. My fabric purse was soaked all the way through, and both of us were drenched from the hems of our jackets down. Doug got a soaker, and I just felt wet and chilly. </p>
<p>We had to go to the bank, but I knew the underground parking area would be jam-packed, and of course it was ... worse than I have ever seen it before. Water was dripping down from the roof above, horns were honking as people vied for spots, and four of the usual spots were so deep in water that no one could park there. I lucked out and found a spot finally, and by the time we got up to ground level, there was the sun shining through again! Exciting times! </p>
<p>Bryn had sent enough money that we could also splurge on his favourite falafil (as the restaurant "Old Jerusalem" spells it), so off we went to do a pick-up. Doug wasn't sure about the eggplant that is part of their falafil sandwich, and I was surprised to see them served like a very long burrito ... a first for us, but we took them home, heated them up, and thoroughly enjoyed them ... sitting upstairs with the storm raging 'round us, watching as Billy Connolly toured around England and Wales, completely bypassing Liverpool! For heaven's sake! How could he? Again though, after seeing again how beautiful it all is, we are both just keen to get back to the British Isles and spend a long while there. </p>
<p>Thank you, Bryn! I'm looking forward to those chips at Monday lunch.  </p>
<p>p.s. I did call Uncle Frank this evening but Glenn and Wendy were visiting with him, he had been out for lunch with his sons, his daughter-in-law and two of his three grandchildren, and also had a visit with Sheldon and Donna after dinner. More is coming up tomorrow for him. He sounded very pleased with his day! </p>
