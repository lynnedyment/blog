								<h2><a href="/2008/11/the_first_of_eleven_days_with_1.html">The First of Eleven Days with Riku</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei arrived all sparkly and full of beans this morning at 8:30. I asked her dad to bring her along for an hour this morning, before their flight, so I could have just a little extra time with her. I've been gone recently for ten days and now she's leaving me for ten... twenty days too many! </p>
<p>We snuggled on the sofa and read three books, the first one three times, just so she made sure she had it down pat, I think. She played with the doctor kit, as one of her favourite things to do these days is open the bandage package on her own, and stick as many as she can get away with on various places on my body. Today I "hurt" on the arm, my hip, and my chest, but felt much better after Dr. Dyment attended to me. Then it was time for an extra breakfast for her. She drew while I fed her two scrambled eggs and some toast and juice; I was astounded to see her draw a face with eyeglasses, but unfortunately she scribbled on it before I could get a clear shot of it. I might try anyway, and post it later. </p>
<p>Doug was driving Akane, Bryn, and Mirei to the airport, so we had some running-around time while we waited for her parents. How she loved it! She and Doug were "racing" back and forth touching a tree to be the winner. We did this last night on the way home too, and she runs fast! At 9:50 A.M. I waved goodbye. Bryn called from the plane at 11:30 to say they spent less than two minutes in the various line-ups. If you have a child on hand these days you get very good service! </p>
<p>I picked Riku up from school, the first of our ten days, eleven nights together. He was surprised we weren't having our "picnic" as usual, but of course he can now have his snacks here at home with me. The conversation is always interesting. Today we talked about my being "poor" because I don't have a mommy and a daddy; I told him Grandpa didn't either and that most people our age do not have parents. Then we discussed how old I would be when he is a daddy, and that his daddy would then be a grandpa. We talked about mean people, and mean parents and grandparents, which Riku thinks is very sad. This came up after a neighbour, also a grandma, stopped to say hello to him; he decided she was a nice grandma. </p>
<p>I have come up with a plan for Riku's school days here and today it worked for us both like a charm. First, snack and about forty-five minutes of free time, which he spent working on excavating his dinosaur from clay, an ongoing project that he loves. Then it was time for piano practice. I sat with him for twenty-five minutes and he was quite happy to go over his pieces, with some explanations involved about what certain notes meant and how he should play them. Doug sat with him for the last five minutes and both of us were amazed at how fast those little fingers can move! </p>
<p>I had a wonderful call from one of my doula moms, Sheila, someone I have been thinking about a lot lately. I was delighted to hear from her, and invited her over for a visit tomorrow. I just cannot wait to see her already nine-month-old daughter! </p>
<p>Kelly and I had a few minutes together chatting online, a rare treat. She had just won a $50 Starbucks card on a radio contest, and is thinking about using it to take her grade one/two split class out for hot chocolate before she turns them over to a new teacher next week. She will have a new class the following week. It was good to catch up a little bit with her and hear about the children; it has been too long since I have talked with any of them except Caillie, who called three times on the weekend. </p>
<p>One other bonus treat for me today was an email from the mom I visited in the hospital on Tuesday; the dad sent me photos of their first baby, a girl whose birth I attended sixteen months ago. She's a beauty still... as is her new baby sister. I'm hoping to visit with them some time very soon! </p>
<p>After piano came about twenty minutes of free time again, which Riku spent part of making the first of several Christmas gifts for various people, mostly cousins and friends. We have just enough time to finish them off if he gets one done a day.Then it was time for two pages of homework... recognizing the beginnings of words, and working on penny and nickel questions.</p>
<p>Then came tub time, dinner — pasta, peas and corn — followed by Riku reading to me in the living room, nice and comfy. He did a fabulous job reading "Ten Apples up on Top", with a seventy-five word vocabulary, but I was very impressed with the expression with which he read it. I must tape him one day, as it was such fun to hear the story read with such enthusiasm. </p>
<p>He had a few minutes to play with one of his two birthday gifts from Auntie Candy and Uncle Rick.. two figures from Star Wars, a big hit! I have one tucked away for another day, and I'm sure he will reach for them as soon as he wakens tomorrow, as I noticed he put them on his bedside table. </p>
<p>Tuck-in time was 7:05 P.M. I wanted to start a chapter book with him, a book Doug found for him called "My Father's Dragon". It just happens to have ten chapters so we will finish it before he goes back home. Perfect! It's a good little book, and Riku would have been happy to have continued on with it, but we agreed that it was fun to wait until tomorrow to see what happens. </p>
<p>He had chosen two books as well... "Don't Let the Pigeon Stay up Late", and "I'm Bad", a pretty silly book that made us both laugh. Almost always when Riku sleeps over, he wraps his arm around my neck and tells me "this is the best part", as he used to when he was just a little boy. It always touched my heart, and still does. I closed his door at 7:30, leaving him sleeping... and went up to watch two taped TV shows with Doug. He gave me a nice back rub, and I fell sound asleep for bits and pieces of the last show! </p>
<p>Bed for me at 11:15... Akane, Bryn, and Mirei are probably waiting for their luggage in Osaka at this point... such a long long day for them all.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/11/a_visit_with_sheila_and_shashi.html">A Visit with Sheila and Shashi</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 7 A.M. today, and decided that we just had to read the next chapter in "My Daddy's Dragon". He is quite taken with the story about islands and danger, and of course a dragon. We may have time to read a second chapter book at this rate! </p>
<p>We had a very relaxed breakfast / getting-ready-for-school time, and left the house at 8:30 on the dot. It was a gorgeous morning, with blue skies and birds singing, both of which Riku noted on the way up the steps. We went over some of his spelling words on the way to school, but he has  them covered with no effort at all on his part. I love the big hugs I get when I leave him at his classroom! </p>
<p>Bryn IM'd to say they had a very good flight with Mirei, who slept for perhaps 20% of the flight and was a happy girl for 100% of it! Amazing! They were going off to dinner with the family in Osaka, and then it was bedtime for them all after that. A little while later, I heard from him again, as he was wide awake at 3 A.M. in Japan. </p>
<p>Finn arrived for a visit with me at 9:30, nodding his head and saying "yeah!" when I asked if he wanted to sweep in the garden. However, after waving goodbye to his mom from the front window, he changed his mind and said "book!" so we sat down and went through about five lift-the-flap books. Some books he likes to read more than once, and he's very clear about his decision on this. If it's done, down it goes; otherwise, he keeps it in his hand and starts in from the first page again. Today he went through the little album Kelly made for me and pointed out his mom and sister to me. </p>
<p>I fed him a big breakfast of oatmeal, banana, and strawberries while he played with the magnetic stacking toy. As one might expect, he loves to build it up high and then laughs out loud when he knocks it over. "Uh oh!" he says when this happens and I pick it all up so he can start over. We spent the next hour in the garden where he does exactly what I do. If I'm sweeping leaves, he's right behind me; if I stop to pick up pine needles to put them in the compost, he does the same. It's adorable! And when his mom came to fetch him at noon, he had just spotted the hose and knew exactly how to get the water to come out of it! </p>
<p>I was expecting Sheila, one of my doula moms from last March to show up in the late morning. It would have been fun for her to see a busy almost-two-year-old, but she took a wrong bus, and didn't arrive until after 1 o'clock. However, it gave Doug time to book tickets for Riku and me to see "The Nutcracker Suite" on December the 28th, the same day that Bryn told me later in the day that Akane's sister and brother-in-law will arrive from Japan for a six-day visit. I sat down to read a bit, while waiting for Sheila to arrive, and was hungry enough by that time that I noshed on two of the tofu pieces Susan had picked up from Japantown, along with some other goodies... inari, sugared black beans, and yummy sweet potatoes.</p>
<p>I went out on the street to meet up with Sheila and the baby; what a cutie she is, and Sheila as lovely as ever. I got lots of smiles from that little girl right away, and of course I like to think it's because she saw me within a minute of being born. I took lots of photos of her, of course, and how sweet that she was wearing the little t-shirt I gave her the day she left the hospital. I gave her another today  to match her little cotton pants she was wearing. </p>
<p>Baby Shashi sat in the high chair while her mommy and I ate our lunch. Shashi quite enjoyed a few black beans too, and took great delight in looking around, getting used to new faces and lots of new things to look at. She is such a good baby, and luckily Sheila knows it! She has been sleeping through the night since she was a new baby, and even had to be wakened to nurse during those first few weeks! It was lovely having time to just sit and chat with Sheila, and hold and play with Shashi. </p>
<p>She had just gone down for her nap when I arrived home with Riku, and he was very happy to have company in the house. He set right to work digging out some more bones from his dino kit, and uncovered several new ones, his biggest number in one sitting to date. He did his piano practice, with Sheila watching, and then he played again for Shashi when she woke up. </p>
<p>She quite enjoyed tinkling away on the keys and watched Riku with big smiles. He was sweet as could be with her, giving Sheila a tiny bird to take home for her, and he made a special toilet paper roll, carefully decorated with lots of colourful stickers for Shashi's first birthday! He even copied Shashi's name down on a piece of paper so that he would remember her name. Such a guy is our boy! Riku loves babies just as much as his Nana, Auntie Kelly, and his daddy do, and I told him he was going to be a wonderful daddy one day. I hope I'm around to see this...</p>
<p><br />
Riku and Doug watched two episodes of "Harold and the Purple Crayon" while I had some extra time with my guests, and when they left at 5 o'clock, I quickly got dinner on the table. I enjoy having Riku read to me right after dinner, as he isn't too tired at that point, and he's had a break. He seems to enjoy it too, and today he read "Put Me in the Zoo", again with such enthusiasm and expression when he sees all those exclamation points! It's a joy hearing him read so well. </p>
<p>Riku had a half hour of play time, which he spent with the action figures from Auntie Candy and Uncle Rick, before heading into the bathroom for the usual night-time routine. We read "The Man Who Lived in a Hat", a story about a very greedy man who was never satisfied, which lead to some discussion about the man not knowing when he should have been happy, and then we read one more chapter in the current book, leading us wondering what was going to happen next. Riku settled into sleep very quickly tonight, and was asleep by 7:45. Unfortunately, after checking the time, I rolled over to snuggle him for another minute and fell fast asleep for a half hour, something I have rarely done. Not good either, as I always feel groggy and worse, rather than better, after a nap.</p>
<p>Doug and I had planned to watch a movie, but settled instead for a taped TV show. I wrote a few emails and read a long chapter in my book "Pillars of the Earth" before turning the light out at 11:45 P.M. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/11/school_glen_canyon_and_some_gi_1.html">School, Glen Canyon, and some Gifts Too!</a></h2>
								<p>I woke up at 7 A.M. today to hear Riku lying beside me quietly muttering the same lines over and over. in no particular order  "I don't WANT to go to school today." "It's the weekend and I don't want to go to school on the weekend!" "I hate going to school." "It's not fair; I go to school in the week... " and on and on it went. I didn't say a word for the longest time, just lay there pretending to be sleeping. When I did open my eyes, I asked him what he was saying, and he told me that no one else had to go to school on the weekend. Of course I told him that every child in his Japanese school was getting ready to go to school, and that we had some time to read before getting up. He suggested another two chapters in his book, and that was the end of that discussion. He bounced out of bed at the end of the chapters and we got on with our day.</p>
<p>Riku opened the last of the two gifts from Candy and Rick this morning... two more action figures from Star Wars. He was thrilled to bits with them and sat at the table until breakfast was ready playing happily with them and the two from yesterday. He then wrote a lovely thank you note to them, ate a great breakfast and got ready to walk out the door with Doug at 8:40. As he was leaving, after kissing me goodbye, he said quietly "I love you Nana. I don't know what else to say." He said this very same thing many many months ago, and I find it so touching. He looks so sincere and it's said with such sweetness... talk about a heartbreaker! </p>
<p>I jumped in the shower, had breakfast, called Beth to see how her knee was feeling after surgery on Tuesday.. she's still really sore, and busied myself easily with a few household chores, before leaving to pick Riku up at noon hour. </p>
<p>He ate his snack in the car, and we stopped in Noe Valley for his long overdue haircut. Bing, my favourite gal, was busy so MiMi cut Riku's and did a great job with it. We stopped in at Walgreen's to wander around the aisles looking at Christmas items as Riku is very fond of Walgreen's, but he ended up with just two small packages of M&Ms as nothing was very appealing to him. He ate perhaps half a dozen of the candies and then turned them over to me. This child is just not a candy eater, unlike his little sister who would happily have eaten the entire package at a sitting. </p>
<p>We stopped in at the house for a half hour so he could eat a bit more, and play with his Lego, before heading out for a walk in Glen Park Canyon. We had talked about going to Ocean Beach today, but I was concerned about Riku falling asleep if we ended up there after a long walk on the beach, and we had just driven from that area already from school. Riku agreed that it made more sense to go tomorrow, so that is the plan.</p>
<p>Doug came with us to Glen Park and Riku convinced him to climb up a very steep hill with him so they could wave from the rocks at the top. The photo doesn't do the hill any justice at all, as it was very high, and I deleted several photos of the two of them leaning over as they walked up holding hands. I happily stayed down below for the photo shoot! Riku and Doug both found temporary walking sticks, went exploring and we all had a grand ol' time. There were lots of folks out, and dogs too, enjoying the sunshine and the blue sky. </p>
<p>It was just cooling down when we were ready for a trip to Target. Riku had a $25 birthday gift card plus an extra $20 besides, and thoroughly enjoyed taking his time picking out the perfect combination of gifts. He ended up with a large set of "Alien Infiltrators", plus a smaller one of an "Astro Fighter" in the Mars Mission series. With three dollars still left to spend, he decided on two craft items... sparkly pipe cleaners and a bag full of multi-colored shiny sequins, perfect for so many things! He walked out proudly carrying the bags himself and kept them in the back seat with him all the way home too. </p>
<p>After a little time checking them all out at home, it was time for piano practice. I enjoy sitting there watching him play, and am amazed at how often he plays the same tune two or three times until he feels it is right. I have a couple of favourite and must record them one day this week.  Riku also typed a note to his daddy on IM, carefully pecking out the letters as I spelled words to him; he told Bryn about his purchases and we had a little message from Bryn saying they were off to stay at a hotel in Osaka soon. </p>
<p>Riku claimed he didn't want a bath, but I know it relaxes him, and despite telling me he wanted to stay in for only five minutes to get the loose hairs off him, he played for twenty and then got busy putting together his Lego "fighter". He did the entire kit on his own, and proudly showed it off to Doug, who was duly impressed with his building and following directions skills! </p>
<p>Riku decided he would like breakfast for dinner tonight, and I happily obliged with two scrambled eggs, two slices of "bacon", a slice of whole wheat toast, and a good sized portion of broccoli and steamed carrots. I am amazed at how much he eats so willingly these days; he must be going through a growth spurt for sure! Once his kit was completed he happily settled in and did four pages of his homework, all easy for him and time intensive as he had to write sentences. He is very methodical about it all, carefully crossing off the words he puts into the sentences before moving on. We also did his spelling words twice in the car, and he read "Ten Apples up on Top" to me once the regular homework was done. The one thing he didn't do was make another of the little gifts he started on yesterday, but we decided he could do two in the morning. </p>
<p>Riku's story tonight was two chapters of his book, and we can't wait to see what happens tomorrow when the main character, a young boy, meets the lion! </p>
<p>That was our day... I'm off to bed to read my book. I'm looking forward to not having a deadline tomorrow morning... we'll just relax and go with the day, seeing how it unfolds. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/11/a_lazy_morning_a_baker_beach_a.html">A Lazy Morning, a Baker Beach Afternoon, and a Relaxing Evening at 1361</a></h2>
								<p>This was the best of days for Riku and for me. No rushing about, no plans with a deadline, and a warm sunny November San Francisco day to do with as we pleased. We started our day off as usual with some reading in bed, a very favourite thing to do, and which we rarely miss out on, even on school days. We read another two chapters in the chapter book but stopped at Riku's suggestion so we could finish the book off tonight. </p>
<p>Riku was already busy unpacking his new big Lego set at the table when I joined him in the kitchen after making the bed and tidying up the books. The stack was close to falling over in his room! He told me he liked me joining him at the table while he built, and it is very impressive to watch him slowly and patiently go from one page to another in the long booklet with directions on how to put together the pieces, 333 of them in this particular one. Last night, there were three pieces left over when he finished the plane, and Doug went and checked the book to see where they went. Riku had insisted they were just extra pieces and sure enough, they were! Doug cannot believe how good he is at this, never asking for help with any of it, unless a piece is particularly stiff and hard to fit into another. </p>
<p>I realized yesterday that I wouldn't be able to give Riku his usual breakfast here, day after day after day. Once a week, during his sleepover, is one thing but after a few days I think he will start protesting. So today, instead of oatmeal with finely chopped nuts and mixed berries, I grated in half an apple, added some raisins and sprinkled it with cinnamon after it was cooked, and he just loved it. Uncle Frank did too when I made it for him in the Falls. Today I joined Riku and we both agreed we would have it again. I am going to try cranberries and almonds tomorrow. </p>
<p>Riku worked away at his Lego for at least an hour, and then wrote another of his thank you notes. We read one of the two great books he got from Kelly and family before he did so, though, so that he could draw a picture for them as well. Doug scanned some of his thank you note pictures for me today, as well as a couple of other pictures he drew this week. </p>
<p>We had planned to have a picnic lunch at Ocean Beach, but Doug suggested we try Baker Beach instead, as it is more protected and would be less cold than our usual spot. It's a little bit closer too, and is a beautiful beach, but Riku discovered that it lacks the one thing he loves best about Ocean Beach... shells! There are lots of smooth rocks, but we didn't spot one shell on two long strolls up and down the beach. However, it was lovely to see the Golden Gate bridge, and it was a perfectly wonderful day, with no wind and with much warmer temps that we expected. </p>
<p>I had made tuna sandwiches for lunch, hoping Riku would like them so he could have that as another option for his school lunches. We did have this once at Ocean Beach months ago, and he liked them then too, and today he told me it was "really tasty!" </p>
<p>We had our lunch first and then went exploring. Riku found a tiny jelly fish, or perhaps an egg sack as someone once told us they were, and that provided him with at least an hour of rinsing, probing, and providing a safe place for it on the way home. It was dead and so I gave him permission to bring it home. He had Doug cut it in two, and was a bit disappointed to find it now just looked like two smaller blobs, but it is now outside, in a special container, and will be checked out in the morning, I'm sure. </p>
<p>Riku did a bit more work on his Lego, and then it was time for piano practice. Fifteen minutes after that... another little break, which seems to help, he whipped through five pages of homework, all very simple for him, but not his favourite activity nonetheless. I was so proud of him for just sticking to it and getting it done! Except for one concept that I am not sure of, he is all done his homework for the week, due on Tuesday. Yahoo! We went over his spelling words in the car, but he knows them with nary a hesitation. </p>
<p>Doug was clearing out a tall boy dresser upstairs today and came down several times with "treasures" for Riku... given after two or three magic tricks, which thrilled Riku to bits. He now has a coin Doug pulled out from behind his ear, and some nice little boxes, and a bottle. Doug promised to show Riku some tricks using his magic wand one day, and let Riku hold it too. Wow! Exciting stuff for this six year old. </p>
<p>Riku finished his big Lego project after his bath and dinner, and has his various projects carefully lined up in what he considers "his" room.</p>
<p>He read half of "Sam and the Firefly" to me tonight; it has lots of new words in it, and is a long book, so we shall finish it off tomorrow. </p>
<p>Our bedtime book was the remainder of the "Daddy and the Dragon" book, so I shall try to find another chapter book on our shelves tomorrow. </p>
<p>Riku is very excited that Auntie Gail and Uncle Tom will be here when he gets home from school tomorrow!</p>

								<p>Riku woke a little earlier than usual this morning, just before 7 o'clock, but he dashed out to get his new Lego figure and came back to play with it on the bed. I dashed up for a quick shower, while he ate his fruit plate at "his" little desk. When I came downstairs he had drawn most of a Christmas picture for his teacher, Ms. Tong, and finished it off with one of his sparkly pipe cleaners. Lucky her; I did take a photo of it though! Ms. Tong is a noticer and commented on Riku's new hair cut; it does suit him, as it shows off his features better I think. </p>
<p>I forgot to mention yesterday that Riku has been humming and singing "Do Re Mi" since he arrived. At any time at all, morning, noon or night, no matter where he is... at the table, in the car, walking to school, in the tub, out comes "Doe, a deer, a female deer... " and he continues on, right to the end and back 'round again. To make me laugh, he says "Lay, a lemon on a lemon" instead of "Ray, a drop of golden sun". Each time he comes out with his version he looks up to make sure I caught it, and that I am responding to it with a smile. I overheard him telling Gail all about this tonight, when he didn't know I was listening. </p>
<p>Doug went online yesterday afternoon and found a version of Julie Andrews singing it... no picture with it, but you can hear her and the children accompanying her, and singing it so well. It goes on to saying how you can sing any tune at all, once you know those notes. He found the entire sequence quite intriguing, and so Doug now has a DVD copy of "Sound of Music" for us to watch during his five days off school. I can't wait to see his reaction to the story and the music. I love to hear him humming happily and I've heard it a lot lately. </p>
<p>I had all sorts of plans to get some work done before Gail and Tom arrived at 11 A.M. I was going to run the vacuum through this floor, and at least get the books in the living room tidied up. When I realized they were coming in over an hour earlier than I thought, I gave up all thoughts of work and decided to eat breakfast and read the paper. I knew Gail wouldn't care at all if there were some specks on the carpet, and I'm learning to just not stress out about these things. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom came with four big suitcases and two of them had to ride home in the back seat with us. They bought lots of wine which we (mostly Tom and I) will have to drink up during their ten day visit. All the paper work from their trip and treats, and gifts and their clothes filled them all up nicely. Gail and I went off to Rainbow for groceries while Doug and Tom struggled getting the bags up the stairs. </p>
<p>We started unpacking the cases once the groceries were put away, and before long it was time to pick Riku up from school. He was very excited that Auntie Gail and Uncle Tom were going to be here when school ended, and was so happy to see Gail standing outside his classroom! He skipped and chatted all the way home, and Gail told him about holding a koala bear. Later on he told his piano teacher that his aunt and uncle had held polar bears! .. and he had seen a photo of them doing so too! She must have been very impressed! </p>
<p>Riku had only one page of homework to do, and it took him about ten minutes to finish it up. That was all he had to do today, as the piano teacher arrived at 5 P.M. and he read to Auntie Gail after dinner. After his bath, he spent his spare time drawing another picture, this one for Auntie Gail, chatting away with her about various things that interest him, and playing with his Lego sets. It seemed a much shorter afternoon/evening with him tonight; I guess three extra people in our day will do that! Gail and Tom were amazed at his piano playing, and his teacher said he was doing very well. I asked her about the hard piece he had been avoiding playing more than once these past few days, and she said he did well at it! He played it twice before the lesson, so perhaps that did the trick. </p>
<p>I read Riku one of the Bernenstein Bear books, one that he especially likes, because the little bear is actually teaching his dad lots of good lessons, but let's his dad believe he is learning them from him. It appeals to his sense of humour I suppose, and it's clever of him to realize what is going on there. He was sound asleep at 7:45 again tonight. </p>
<p>I had made a mushroom risotto for dinner tonight, and Gail kindly cleared up the pot and kitchen while I tucked him in. We had also been working on the laundry together, as they came home with lots of it, and I had my usual Monday wash to do as well. Once all that was underway again, Gail and I had a game of cards, looked at two photo albums on my computer, and checked out some new photos on the Ancestry site too. </p>
<p>Gail and Tom managed to stay awake until 10:30, despite that long long flight over two days body time, and I'm heading off to bed soon too, after getting the photos up here. </p>
<p>I'm so looking forward to this time with Gail, as she says she will be more than happy to stay home and help me get some things organized around here, chores that are much easier with two of us. I need the inspiration! <br />

								<h2><a href="/2008/11/a_quiet_day_before_the_very_lo.html">A Quiet Day before the Very Long Holiday Weekend</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 7 this morning, giving us time to snuggle under the duvet and read the last half of the story we started yesterday. We stayed in bed for a half hour, and then got busy with the usual breakfast routine. Gail sat with him at the table while he drew a picture for her, and then looked at the map of the world to find Australia. While he was at it, he found Japan, Vancouver, Ontario, and Hawaii too. </p>
<p>I walked him to school and had the sliced olives with me for their Thanksgiving lunch. I didn't realize he didn't need a regular lunch today, as they were making up a pasta dish with all sorts of veggies added to it, fresh fruit and juice, as each child contributed something. Riku told Gail and me later that he didn't eat the olives but ate some of the coloured spiral pasta. </p>
<p>Gail and I enjoyed yummy dippy eggs with sourdough toast, and hot cups of tea for our breakfast. She was really hungry today, no doubt because it was dinner time in Australia or something like that! Doug and Tom went off at 11 A.M. to Berkeley to pick up a case of corn relish for Doug, wander the book and record stores, and enjoyed lunch at "Barney's" as well. Tom was very impressed with it, and they didn't even manage to finish the shared order of fries. They do make very large "burgers" there, and Tom said there was so much breast of chicken in his that he had to cut it off the edges in order to eat it! Yup, America knows how to super-size all right! </p>
<p>Gail and I finished up all the laundry by noon hour, including all the ironing, and a couple of pieces of mine. Then we treated ourselves to a game of cards before Gail went to put their clothes away, and get the suitcases sorted out for storage in the store room for the next twelve days. That was a huge job as they had four big full cases, with lots of paperwork, etc. to go through. Gail also tossed some clothes she won't wear again, and I started wrapping Christmas gifts for the children! It felt so good to be getting at that, as it gives me some idea what I have for them and what I need. I didn't get it all done, but a good start for sure, as it was time to pick Riku up. </p>
<p>He seemed just a little less his usual happy self today; even Gail noticed it. He may not have eaten enough at lunch with that mixed dish, so I gave him the half "meat" sandwich for his snack, along with chocolate soy milk and a big container of grapes, all of which disappeared very quickly. For a treat I allowed him to watch a movie; no homework and no school tomorrow, so it was time for a "light" week day. Gail made tea and brought it up for us, as we all sat on the bed and watched "Cinderella 2". Riku enjoys these sweet movies very much; I just love to watch his face as he sits with a smile on his face, and frequently laughs out loud at the antics of the mice, or a funny personality. It was lovely and relaxing for all of us, and Riku was snuggled up beside me the entire time. Watching movies with children is the best excuse in the world to just completely relax! </p>
<p>Grandpa had a couple of interesting things to show to Riku on the computer, and then it was time for piano practice. For the first time, his heart just wasn't in it tonight; he seemed tired out, even though he slept for over eleven hours last night. I wonder if he is going through a growth spurt as he is eating huge amounts of food lately. Gail can't believe how much mushroom risotto he ate last night, plus two custard cups full of veggies, and tonight he ate a double portion of lasagna, with the usual two generous servings of vegetables again. This morning he asked for a piece of sourdough toast as soon as he had finished his fruit plate, and then ate his cereal as well. Gail thought he had grown taller just since she saw him in August, and I'm sure he is going to go through another spurt soon, at this rate of calories going in! </p>
<p>However, he managed to get through twenty minutes of practice tonight, and even voluntarily did the last song three times. He just didn't want to do the really hard two pieces more than once, which was fine for today. I read four books at the table while Riku, Gail, and Tom ate, and then while I ate, Gail read several stories in a book he hasn't heard for a while... the Mike Mulligan steam shovel book. That little head was just drooping by this time, and as soon as he ate his second big helping of grapes for dessert, after refusing his favourite coconut pineapple ice cream(!), he told me he was tired and wanted to go to bed. We got ready in record time and soon I was reading a dozen or so Shel Silverstein poems to him. At 7:35 I walked out of his room. I'm so glad he has three week days off school coming up, plus the weekend! </p>
<p>Gail and I had a very productive evening. We played one game of cards and enjoyed a last cup of hot tea for the day, and then went into their front bedroom and sorted through six bags of children's toys and clothing. In less than an hour we had the front hall filled with bags to go to various places tomorrow. I'm not sure when we will do this, but perhaps first thing in the morning just to have that big job finished up! I called one of my doula moms and her husband will come by for two bags of toys and clothing for their three boys. </p>
<p>I saved a few things for a doula mom expecting in January, and another lot of toys for Sheila's little girl Shashi, who visited with us on Friday. And of course I just had to save a few special things that belonged to one of the grandchildren. Perhaps next time I go through them I will feel I can part with them, but I have learned through the process of helping Uncle Frank that easy does it works better than a full our assault on our memories. </p>
<p>The last job of the evening was a big one too; together we went through a big grocery bag filled with Riku's school work, some from this year but lots from last year too. Most of it went into recycling but it was worth going through it all in order to save the gems. </p>
<p>And now it's bedtime... once again well past what would be ideal for these busy days. It's almost midnight, so goodnight! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/11/rainy_day_bolt_and_a_visitor.html">Rainy Day, "Bolt", and a Visitor</a></h2>
								<p>We had plans... Gail, Riku, and I were going to go to the Bay Area Discovery Museum, and start off our time there with a picnic lunch. Doug and Tom were going to catch a bus to Fisherman's Wharf and catch a ferry to Alcatraz. So, we had a long leisurely breakfast with sourdough toast, and tea included, and enjoyed our morning. And then it started to rain. Darn! But there was a movie Riku was interested in seeing, about a "star" dog who believed in his own super-powers until he was out of the studio and in the real world. That seemed the perfect substitute for us, and Tom was fine with doing a book/burrito/record store run. I called to see if Amelia could join us and we were all set for our day.</p>
<p>Doug dropped us off at 11:20, Susan, Finn, and Amelia joined us at the theatre, and in we went with a big bag of popcorn to share, and one for Finn and Susan. Finn likes his own bag. Finn was tired and ready for his nap, and Susan decided it would be more fun to sit in a theatre than in a car. However, Finn didn't sleep for one minute; he was totally engrossed in the movie, and sat so sweetly on Susan's lap taking it all in, munching on popcorn, and having an occasional nursing. Both Amelia and Riku were totally involved in what was going on on the big screen too. They had yogurt, popcorn, grapes, and some juice during the movie, never taking their eyes off the screen. </p>
<p>Amelia asked if she could come home with us, which was just perfect for the "big" kids. They don't see much of each other anymore with their various busy schedules, so it was the best possible way to end their day. Susan dropped her off, along with a walnut pie... yum! Gail put the kettle on when we got home, the children were off and busy, and Tom and Doug set off for Costco just to pick up a couple of items for me. They came home bearing a big pumpkin pie for tomorrow too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the children painted, they played on the bed with their shirts off(!), they played with the doctor kit, which involved lots of bandages and "medicine", while Gail and I had time for an afternoon game of cards with our tea. At one point, they both asked for a tub together, one of their favourite things to do. They played happily in there for forty-five minutes, with a tub full of squirting animals; once when I walked in they were pretending they were eating sushi and they had wiggly legs hanging out of their mouths. They are growing up so fast, and I enjoy this time with them so much. I wrapped them both in warm towels, got Riku into his PJs, and dried Amelia's hair upstairs, enjoying a little quiet time alone with her. She told me if we didn't dry her hair and she put her head band on, her hair would look "just terrible!". </p>
<p>Kevin came by to pick up Amelia around 5 o'clock, Riku was busy practicing the piano, and I made him a quick dinner of two scrambled eggs, "bacon", toast, and a very generous serving of mixed vegetables. He was a hungry boy, told me "it was just what I wanted!", ate it all up, and then finished off the last bit of his favourite coconut and pineapple ice cream.</p>
<p>Gail and Tom treated us to Philly cheesesteak sandwiches that Tom and Doug had picked up earlier, so that was a fast and filling meal for us. Tuck in time for Riku with a story by Riku and then poems for him. He was sound asleep at 7:40 tonight, and when I got out Gail and I sorted through a big bag full of Riku's school work. I saved his art work, and a few pieces of the written work, but had only a nice little stack by the time we finished. Having someone to work with on a project like this sure makes life easier! We finished off the evening with a cup of tea and a game of cards and then it was tuck-in for the adults too. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/11/happy_thanksgiving_1.html">Happy Thanksgiving!</a></h2>
								<p>We had a very quiet relaxing day here today, starting off with Riku and me reading for forty minutes in bed. I made up his fruit plate for him about halfway through, and when I went in with it, Riku had continued reading the Shel Silverstein poems. Such a sweet sight! </p>
<p>We did lots of fun things... in the morning Riku painted a big bright picture, made a thank you card for Lili and Sam with the paints, continued on with his surprise Christmas gifts, started a sweet potato plant, and played with his Lego set. I had hoped to go out to see Andy Goldsworthy's latest creation in the Presidio, but Riku nixed that plan, and so we went with his idea of some time in the playground, just off  the top of Rhode Island Street. Tom and Doug stayed home, and Gail, Riku, and I drove off for an hour. Riku loves playing "monster", and Gail and I between us, kept him busy and happy running around. </p>
<p>Then it was home for lunch upstairs while watching "ET". Riku told me he wanted just fruit for lunch, something that he asks for a lot these days. After his birthday party two weeks ago, I asked him if he would like a slice of carrot cake or a brownie, and his answer was "I will just have some strawberries"! Today, though, he did surprise me by getting into his Hallowe'en candy and having a piece of chocolate. With the mints he made a container of "poison", and labelled it as such, by adding the mints to water and tossing in some clay bits too. </p>
<p>Gail and I watched "ET" with him and he went from snuggling one of us to the other. We were warm and cozy up there, and Riku thoroughly enjoyed it all. Nothing is scary if someone is there watching with you! </p>
<p>After the movie, Riku watched Grandpa put together the dinosaur, finally freed of the clay. He had dug it all out a couple of days ago, but it needed the final bits dug out of the bones themselves. It was a little hard for Riku to assemble himself, as even Doug found parts of it hard to do, but he sure liked it when it was finished. He set it up looking as though he had eaten part of a building and was leaning against the rest of it. </p>
<p>Riku has been asking to talk to Bryn for the past two days, wanting to fill him in on things he has done and seen, and today we lucked out timing-wise. Bryn IM'd from Kyoto, not long before they were leaving their hotel, and so we got up on Skype together. Riku was such a happy boy, talking with his sister, telling he bought her something special that was pink. She replied "What is it?" and he told her it was a surprise. He was obviously delighted to be talking with her, and kept telling her all sorts of things on his mind. Auntie Gail said hello to Mirei too, and it will be such fun to see her next week. Riku talked to his mom and dad too. </p>
<p>Gail had suggested yesterday that we make a proper Thanksgiving dinner, something I normally wouldn't have bothered with. However, Riku asked this afternoon if we were going to do something for Thanksgiving, and so I was very glad we had a plan. I had a couple of frozen bean loaves in the freezer, so we cooked those up, Gail did a big potful of combined carrots and parsnips, I made up some mashed potatoes, and Gail did the gravy while I bathed Riku. He was a tired boy, more so than he should have been, considering he has been sleeping eleven plus hours every night since he arrived, but he was very sensitive and needy, and the tub was exactly what he needed to just relax and be ready for his special dinner. </p>
<p>We lit candles, put Riku's centerpiece (which he made yesterday with Amelia) on the table, and hung his turkey drawing in the dining room, making it look and feel very festive. Riku had seconds and thirds of the mashed potatoes and the bean loaf, really liked the cranberry jelly, but passed on the gravy. Dinner was delicious, Tom poured the wine, and dessert was pumpkin pie. </p>
<p>Riku was sound asleep at 7:25, after a Henry and Mudge book and just three poems. The weather is supposed to be warmer tomorrow, and we're hoping for an Ocean Beach day! </p>
<p>Gail and I enjoyed tea and cards, after the guys cleared up most of the kitchen, Doug unloaded and loaded the dishwasher, and I caught up on a few emails to long-neglected friends. Bedtime too late for me again, but I got my blog done!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/11/home_santa_and_do_re_mi.html">"Home", Santa, and "Do Re Mi"!</a></h2>
								<p>Today was just the best of days! Riku woke at six o'clock, an hour too early for me, so I suggested we sleep until seven, and at ten to Riku woke me up asking if I would like to read another poem. He's a big Silverstein fan, this boy!</p>
<p>We did read about eight poems, then he was off to the kitchen to paint a big new picture. While the paint was out, he worked on two more of his Christmas projects and did some art work on the thank you note for Lili and Sam too. </p>
<p>When we were in bed, Riku asked if we could go to his home this morning, so he could play with his toys, and put the Lego he had built here at his house. "Of course!" I replied, and for that I got a big kiss and a big "thank you, I love you" too! So, that was our plan for the morning. He happily puttered about, playing with his Lego, the dino, and working at his desk, while I had a lazy morning with a leisurely breakfast with Gail and Tom, reading the paper. At 11:30, Gail, Riku, and I headed off to his house. </p>
<p>He was funny though, as he tried so hard to convince me to take the car instead of walking. I rarely drive the car to his house and felt we all needed the walk, so then he told me he would be "embarrassed" if anyone saw him carrying his Lego monster. I suggested a green cloth bag, instead of the plastic one he had put it in originally, so that was that argument closed. Today he told me he would be "livid" about something, a word I have never heard him use before. That led us to coming up with lots of words for anger; one he used the other day was "furious". Fun to hear all these new words emerging. </p>
<p>We spent two full hours at "home", with Riku busy in his room for a while, building Lego, bringing one DVD after another out for us to see (Gail and I played cards in the kitchen while drinking tea), and showing Gail a brochure of some of the Lego kits he had. The time really flew by, and so I made Riku a grilled cheese sandwich, before heading back home. We stopped to show Gail the sculpture he often climbs at the hospital. He skipped between us holding hands, and we counted all the way to over 300 on our way. Gail suggested this and started by counting to twenty, then it was his turn and then mine. </p>
<p>Back at home, Riku wanted to watch a taped Japanese movie he couldn't watch at home. I didn't sit with him as usual, but did stay in the room sorting through children's clothes to take to Patricia and to give to Susan. Gail and I ran those off to Patrizia when the movie had ended. Riku stayed home with "the guys", while Gail and I had about fifteen minutes with Patrizia and the baby. I had the Japanese Miffi walker for him as well as Riku's saucer seat, fondly referred to at one point as his "office". </p>
<p>Our afternoon plan was to see the big tree at Ghirardelli Square lit at 5:30, so I made Riku two scrambled eggs with bacon to tide him over until dinner. He had also eaten grapes and toast and some cheese as a snack watching the movie, so I knew he had a full tummy. We had the best time! We got there early enough that we were very close to the tree, closer than we have even been before. We even had a good view of Santa before he went on stage! The half hour before the show began passed quickly, as Riku had a (Sky) Blue candy cane that we each received when arriving, Gail had found some hot apple cider for Riku to sip on, and at one point they made it "snow" on us, much to Riku's delight! It  was soapy, thick flakes but looked very realistic coming down, which was such fun for all of us. We saw a tiny bit of "A Christmas Carol" (and ended up discussing it in the car on the way home), sang some Christmas songs with a local school group, and the best part of all was that Riku got to talk to Santa briefly. He had told me days ago that he was going to ask Santa if he really lived at the North Pole, and that is exactly what he did tonight. Santa's answer was "yes", and Riku walked away smiling, with a Ghirardelli chocolate square in his hand. </p>
<p>We had been lucky enough to find parking very close to the Square and as soon as we got in the car, Riku opened his window and started calling out in a very loud voice "<strong>Merry Christmas! Ho Ho Ho!</strong>" It was just hilarious as he wasn't the least bit embarrassed and in fact seemed to be taking huge delight in doing so. He turned some heads tonight and it was such fun to hear him being so boisterous and outgoing. At some point, he closed his window and led us all into a grand round of "Do Re Mi", instructing us all to sing together, then one at a time, telling us which one was up next. We sang all the way to Safeway, right until the minute we turned off the engine. </p>
<p>He buzzed around the store with Gail and me, and spotted frozen mac' and cheese in the refrigerated area, and told me he "<strong>loved</strong>" that dinner, and then when he heard Gail and Tom suggest we have pizza, their treat, he told me he loved that too. I don't believe the food this boy is tucking away this week! Doug picked up an Amy's organic mac' and cheese, and home we came with our purchases, singing all the way home too. Riku got into his PJs lickety-split, ate most of the mac and cheese with some peas, drank two small glasses of apple juice, and polished off a custard cup of coconut pineapple ice cream which we had also replenished at the store. </p>
<p>While eating, Riku drew four(!) pictures, promising both Gail and me two of them, and laughing at our "arguments" about who would get each one. Kelly called at one point to suggest that we take him to see "Bolt" and so he had a little chat with her about their favourite parts of the movie. He told her he was going to make her Christmas present tomorrow, but was wise enough not to say what it was. </p>
<p>Tonight was the latest that Riku was tucked in, but I was pleased to close his door at 8:05. Gail had tea made and the cards set up, and that was our day... a lovely one indeed!  </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/11/a_warm_and_sunny_bay_area_disc.html">A Warm and Sunny Bay Area Discovery Museum Day!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku awoke at midnight scratching at his legs; he has had a fine rash on his torso and limbs for a while, but it seemed to be getting worse. Tonight it was obviously bothering him more than usual, as his skin was hot to the touch and itching badly. I knew neither of us would be able to sleep, so I suggested he have some medicine for it. He agreed, and I gave him a dose of an antihistamine. It seemed to work almost instantly and much to my surprise he woke at 7:50, the latest he has ever slept here! He had wakened briefly two hours earlier but rolled over and went right back to sleep when I told him it was very early. </p>
<p>He got right up this morning, and went off to draw at the table. I just could not get over how detailed this drawing was... a man on a diving board, a pool, a shark covered with a net, with blood flowing from his mouth... complete with a small fish nearby he had been eating, two boys throwing life preservers, a woman sitting at an umbrella covered deck chair saying "be careful", two figures throwing life preservers and a bird dropping two apples down to the shark! </p>
<p>Gail was up already, and we had a lazy time "chillin" at the table with Riku, talking about things in the paper, and what we should do today. I gave him three choices... the BADM, the zoo, or Ocean Beach if it warmed up. The latter didn't seem likely, as we were so fogged in, but by the time the adults had all showered and eaten, the day was warming up. </p>
<p>Riku on his own had done his piano practice, playing many of his songs twice, if he felt he hadn't done a good job, and making Gail and I guess which song he was playing from one of four books. After each one he would call out and ask us if we liked it, and which one we liked the best. After that, he and Gail sat at the table for the longest time working on the first Play-Doh project of the day, involving lots of colours and shapes. </p>
<p>By this time Riku had decided the BADM was his choice, so I packed up a lunch for him and we left around noon hour. Doug and Tom left us there to explore Corte Madera and Sausalito, and agreed to meet us in two hours or so. Alex, one of Riku's kindergarten classmates, was there with his dad, and they played on the boat together for about a half hour. Then Riku seemed happy wandering about from one activity to another. We climbed the hill to ring the bell, and spent about forty-five minutes in and about the twig "house" with its many rooms, with Gail trying to find Riku, and with him dashing madly about screeching in delight when they ran into each other. How he loved it all! </p>
<p>We stopped for his picnic lunch, and he ate lots as always, plus a full slice of "Grandpa's toast" in the car. He decided for the first time that the painting/clay/craft area was for "little children" and went on to the craft room for the older children. He did a little "drum painting", whirling a brush full of green paint on top of a paper drum, but it wasn't terribly interesting, so we moved on to the moving exhibits area. Riku told me he would do each one of those, and did so, and then we went to the indoor fishing boat, where he spent another forty-five minutes playing with a huge number of children. They "caught" crabs, weighed them, sold them, and steered the boat, making it move with the 101 pirates he kept running to tell us were on board. It was fun to see so many children playing together so well and having such a great time at it all. </p>
<p>Tea time for Gail and me after that and Riku, fittingly, had some "Pirate Booty", a cheese popcorn snack. Gail and I shared a bag as well as the last of Riku's when he had had enough of his. There was a new sports exhibit in the big hall across the way from the picnic area, and so we ended our last half hour there. Riku tried out each of the machines, with the simulated surf board being a favourite, and successfully used one of the machines to test strength. When he first sat down at it, he had to stand and really use all his might to push the bars out, but after a half dozen tries, he realized he could actually do it properly and did so until his arm muscles must have been feeling it! </p>
<p>Grandpa and Tom arrived, and we ended our time there with Riku picking out a few treasures in the store, a treat from Gail and Tom. He bought capsules that turn into trains and dinos too, and a perfect shiny polished fossilized rock to add to his collection. Of course we finished off our day time there, as we always do, watching a penny or two or three spin 'round and round before they dropped into a base.</p>
<p>Riku sang all the way home, in a very loud voice once more, with the window down and having us join in. He made up silly words to "Do Re Mi" and made Gail and me memorize them, and then sing them independently, laughing so much when we substituted sillier words for his silly words. What a character he is! I'm not sure his parents are going to appreciate this loud and outgoing singer-personality he has developed lately! </p>
<p>We stopped at Rainbow for a few groceries. Riku went in with the men, and even brought back two pieces of cheese samples on one toothpick, telling us it was really good cheese, and also telling us too late that he really liked it, and if we didn't want it, he would eat it. As soon as we got home, I got dinner preparations going, while he and Gail started in on yet another Play-Doh project. I got photos of course! </p>
<p>Riku really enjoyed the nine-grain bean loaf we had for Thanksgiving dinner, so he had that along with the rest of the mac and cheese he didn't finish last night, a custard bowl full of mixed veggies, and some of my baked potato. He was drawing during dinner, not something he usually does at dinner time, but he was happy doing so, and I am happy seeing him draw.</p>
<p>Gail and I have been having a friendly "competition" trying to get Riku to give us his paintings. Gail makes her case by telling Riku that I get all the paintings he does when she is not here (which is true), <strong>but</strong> I have such a hard time not keeping every one of them, and I tend to lose out here, as Riku sees her point and tells me she is right. Bah, humbug! Gail was given the one this morning, and then he decided to give her the one he drew tonight as well. Not fair! He told us to each choose a number and she chose "four", the right one. I loved it, as it was the first time he drew a lion and the entire drawing was so detailed, but I get to take a photo of it, and Riku thought that was fine. He did promise me, though, that tomorrow he would make me another with a lion and a cloud covering part of the sun as well, as I liked it so much. </p>
<p>Riku had some pumpkin pie for dessert and by 6 P.M. was splashing happily in the tub. He had some time on the computer, "drawing" using the Crayola site, then read to me, had a yogurt and some grapes for an extra snack, and after six Shel Silverstein poems he was tucked in, asleep at 7:45. I gave him an antihistamine, as I was so very pleased with how the rash had lessened in roughness and in redness. Fingers crossed that it is an allergy of some kind, and we can figure out what caused it. </p>
<p>Oh, one funny aside... Riku, a few days ago, heard me saying "<strong>Gail Rodgers!</strong>" when she did something I object to (such as insisting that Riku give <strong>her</strong> his drawings, and he has picked up on that in exactly the same tone. So, when she raises her eyebrows, or "talks" back to me, or pretends she can't hear me by putting her hands over her ears, Riku pipes up with "<strong>Gail Rodgers!</strong>" and sounds exactly like me. It's the funniest thing, and tonight he started in on "<strong>Lynne Rodgers!</strong>" so I am likely to be hearing that for the next few months! </p>
<p>Gail had the kitchen all tidied up when I came out from tucking Riku in, and we had two cups of hot tea, a piece of pie (I had yummy walnut pie that Susan had bought for us the day before yesterday, and Gail had pumpkin) and played three games of cards. </p>
<p>Lazy night around here, with just one more night with Riku before his parents and sister arrive home. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/11/ocean_beach_and_rikus_todo_lli.html">Ocean Beach!.. and Riku's "To-Do" List of Ten</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 7:40 this morning, giving him twelve hours of sleep exactly last night. He was sleeping so soundly that when I woke at 7 A.M. that I left him sleeping and got up to write a couple of emails while the house was quiet. Then I joined him when he called out, and we lay in bed talking and snuggling. Uncle Mark called while we were in chatting and Riku talked to Caillie, who was in Parry Sound visiting her grandparents, who were celebrating their 50th anniversary with a party today. He and Caillie discussed their favourite parts of the movie "Bolt" as well. </p>
<p>After that Riku asked "What is the plan for today?", so I filled him in on some of the things we could do and those we had to do. So, before getting out of bed, we had this plan: 1) Ocean Beach 2) draw me two pictures 3) piano practice 4) Christmas gift for Auntie Kelly and Uncle Gregg  5) one page of homework due Tuesday 6) start decorating for Christmas 7) watch "The Sound of Music" 8) hmmmmm, I just cannot remember these last two, and to my surprise, neither could Riku when I asked him the next day! We both said them several times too, holding up our thumbs and fingers to point each one of them out. I might come up with them yet! </p>
<p>It was interesting to do this list with him, as he decided on his own to play the piano for us while we, the adults, ate breakfast and he ended up playing for more than the usual twenty minutes. This was because he played the pieces we liked the best more than once, and often three times. I taped him today, as he was just enjoying himself, and then spent fifteen minutes trying to get Gail and I to stay in tune while he sat at the table with us, and one of his piano books. Helpless cause! But we sure had fun, and had him laughing out loud. </p>
<p>About a half hour before we left for the beach Riku told me he wanted  to do his homework, even though he had said earlier he would do it in the afternoon. I think he liked being able to make these decisions, and then having them out of the way. </p>
<p>He played with a big container of joining pieces working his way around the house with them, drew one of my two pictures for me, and kept himself busy at his desk for the longest time as well. He ate a late breakfast, after snacking his way through the usual breakfast time, and so I packed up a hearty snack to have at the beach. What a perfect beach day this was! He, Gail, and I spent two plus hours there, walking a long long way up to the far end, searching for shells, and not having any luck at all. It was the worst day ever in fact as he found only one broken sand dollar and a broken tiny shell. However, the tide was way out, and as it rushed in, it left "islands" we could get to by wading into the water. The sun was sparkling on the waves, which were huge today, and we just walked and enjoyed all the dogs trying to catch the gulls, along with all the other hundreds of people just taking in the warm sunshine. Heaven for all of us! </p>
<p>Grandpa watched part of "The Sound of Music" with Riku just a few minutes after we arrived home. Gail and I made tea, and shared a sandwich, while playing three games of cards. The movie is much too long to watch in one sitting, but when I went up to tell Riku he had five minutes until tub time, he told me he has just seen them singing "Do Re Mi" and could stop right away. He said he wanted a five minute tub, so we could get busy decorating, but instead he chose to just lie in the warm tub relaxing for about twenty minutes, playing with just two squirting toys while he lay there. </p>
<p>Doug and Tom went off to Hampshire Street to return the keyboard, all ready for Riku's lesson tomorrow, and Gail and I put dinner on the table. Riku ate as soon as it was ready, and enjoyed his asparagus ravioli with tomato sauce so much that he told me it was "so good" and "delicious" after each bite! And then he told me he liked Gai's and my mushroom ravioli too. He had two generous helpings of veggies as well, and was all set to decorate! </p>
<p>Earlier Gail and I had washed the windows and cleared the shells off the top shelf, so Riku was all set to stick the snowflake decorations up with me. He even counted them on each window to make sure they were evenly dispersed. They look great and we shall continue decorating each time he is over. Riku so enjoys this season, and is just so excited about it all. He chose an Advent calendar too, so he will open the first window tomorrow. </p>
<p>Riku was tucked in and asleep at 7:40 tonight, smelling of the coconut shampoo he likes so much. Me too. This is our last night together after ten wonderful days with him. Tomorrow I will walk him to school, and no doubt his mom will pick him up. And we will possibly have some time with Mirei tomorrow! She will be a very tired girl after her long trip. </p>
<p>Gail and I ate our salad once I came out of Riku's room, I finished off my red wine from Australia that Tom had opened last night, and then it was tea time and cards. How the days fly by!  </p>
