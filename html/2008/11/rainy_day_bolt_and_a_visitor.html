								<h2>Rainy Day, "Bolt", and a Visitor</h2>
								<p>We had plans... Gail, Riku, and I were going to go to the Bay Area Discovery Museum, and start off our time there with a picnic lunch. Doug and Tom were going to catch a bus to Fisherman's Wharf and catch a ferry to Alcatraz. So, we had a long leisurely breakfast with sourdough toast, and tea included, and enjoyed our morning. And then it started to rain. Darn! But there was a movie Riku was interested in seeing, about a "star" dog who believed in his own super-powers until he was out of the studio and in the real world. That seemed the perfect substitute for us, and Tom was fine with doing a book/burrito/record store run. I called to see if Amelia could join us and we were all set for our day.</p>
<p>Doug dropped us off at 11:20, Susan, Finn, and Amelia joined us at the theatre, and in we went with a big bag of popcorn to share, and one for Finn and Susan. Finn likes his own bag. Finn was tired and ready for his nap, and Susan decided it would be more fun to sit in a theatre than in a car. However, Finn didn't sleep for one minute; he was totally engrossed in the movie, and sat so sweetly on Susan's lap taking it all in, munching on popcorn, and having an occasional nursing. Both Amelia and Riku were totally involved in what was going on on the big screen too. They had yogurt, popcorn, grapes, and some juice during the movie, never taking their eyes off the screen. </p>
<p>Amelia asked if she could come home with us, which was just perfect for the "big" kids. They don't see much of each other anymore with their various busy schedules, so it was the best possible way to end their day. Susan dropped her off, along with a walnut pie... yum! Gail put the kettle on when we got home, the children were off and busy, and Tom and Doug set off for Costco just to pick up a couple of items for me. They came home bearing a big pumpkin pie for tomorrow too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the children painted, they played on the bed with their shirts off(!), they played with the doctor kit, which involved lots of bandages and "medicine", while Gail and I had time for an afternoon game of cards with our tea. At one point, they both asked for a tub together, one of their favourite things to do. They played happily in there for forty-five minutes, with a tub full of squirting animals; once when I walked in they were pretending they were eating sushi and they had wiggly legs hanging out of their mouths. They are growing up so fast, and I enjoy this time with them so much. I wrapped them both in warm towels, got Riku into his PJs, and dried Amelia's hair upstairs, enjoying a little quiet time alone with her. She told me if we didn't dry her hair and she put her head band on, her hair would look "just terrible!". </p>
<p>Kevin came by to pick up Amelia around 5 o'clock, Riku was busy practicing the piano, and I made him a quick dinner of two scrambled eggs, "bacon", toast, and a very generous serving of mixed vegetables. He was a hungry boy, told me "it was just what I wanted!", ate it all up, and then finished off the last bit of his favourite coconut and pineapple ice cream.</p>
<p>Gail and Tom treated us to Philly cheesesteak sandwiches that Tom and Doug had picked up earlier, so that was a fast and filling meal for us. Tuck in time for Riku with a story by Riku and then poems for him. He was sound asleep at 7:40 tonight, and when I got out Gail and I sorted through a big bag full of Riku's school work. I saved his art work, and a few pieces of the written work, but had only a nice little stack by the time we finished. Having someone to work with on a project like this sure makes life easier! We finished off the evening with a cup of tea and a game of cards and then it was tuck-in for the adults too. </p>
