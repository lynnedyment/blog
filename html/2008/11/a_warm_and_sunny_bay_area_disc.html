								<h2>A Warm and Sunny Bay Area Discovery Museum Day!</h2>
								<p>Riku awoke at midnight scratching at his legs; he has had a fine rash on his torso and limbs for a while, but it seemed to be getting worse. Tonight it was obviously bothering him more than usual, as his skin was hot to the touch and itching badly. I knew neither of us would be able to sleep, so I suggested he have some medicine for it. He agreed, and I gave him a dose of an antihistamine. It seemed to work almost instantly and much to my surprise he woke at 7:50, the latest he has ever slept here! He had wakened briefly two hours earlier but rolled over and went right back to sleep when I told him it was very early. </p>
<p>He got right up this morning, and went off to draw at the table. I just could not get over how detailed this drawing was... a man on a diving board, a pool, a shark covered with a net, with blood flowing from his mouth... complete with a small fish nearby he had been eating, two boys throwing life preservers, a woman sitting at an umbrella covered deck chair saying "be careful", two figures throwing life preservers and a bird dropping two apples down to the shark! </p>
<p>Gail was up already, and we had a lazy time "chillin" at the table with Riku, talking about things in the paper, and what we should do today. I gave him three choices... the BADM, the zoo, or Ocean Beach if it warmed up. The latter didn't seem likely, as we were so fogged in, but by the time the adults had all showered and eaten, the day was warming up. </p>
<p>Riku on his own had done his piano practice, playing many of his songs twice, if he felt he hadn't done a good job, and making Gail and I guess which song he was playing from one of four books. After each one he would call out and ask us if we liked it, and which one we liked the best. After that, he and Gail sat at the table for the longest time working on the first Play-Doh project of the day, involving lots of colours and shapes. </p>
<p>By this time Riku had decided the BADM was his choice, so I packed up a lunch for him and we left around noon hour. Doug and Tom left us there to explore Corte Madera and Sausalito, and agreed to meet us in two hours or so. Alex, one of Riku's kindergarten classmates, was there with his dad, and they played on the boat together for about a half hour. Then Riku seemed happy wandering about from one activity to another. We climbed the hill to ring the bell, and spent about forty-five minutes in and about the twig "house" with its many rooms, with Gail trying to find Riku, and with him dashing madly about screeching in delight when they ran into each other. How he loved it all! </p>
<p>We stopped for his picnic lunch, and he ate lots as always, plus a full slice of "Grandpa's toast" in the car. He decided for the first time that the painting/clay/craft area was for "little children" and went on to the craft room for the older children. He did a little "drum painting", whirling a brush full of green paint on top of a paper drum, but it wasn't terribly interesting, so we moved on to the moving exhibits area. Riku told me he would do each one of those, and did so, and then we went to the indoor fishing boat, where he spent another forty-five minutes playing with a huge number of children. They "caught" crabs, weighed them, sold them, and steered the boat, making it move with the 101 pirates he kept running to tell us were on board. It was fun to see so many children playing together so well and having such a great time at it all. </p>
<p>Tea time for Gail and me after that and Riku, fittingly, had some "Pirate Booty", a cheese popcorn snack. Gail and I shared a bag as well as the last of Riku's when he had had enough of his. There was a new sports exhibit in the big hall across the way from the picnic area, and so we ended our last half hour there. Riku tried out each of the machines, with the simulated surf board being a favourite, and successfully used one of the machines to test strength. When he first sat down at it, he had to stand and really use all his might to push the bars out, but after a half dozen tries, he realized he could actually do it properly and did so until his arm muscles must have been feeling it! </p>
<p>Grandpa and Tom arrived, and we ended our time there with Riku picking out a few treasures in the store, a treat from Gail and Tom. He bought capsules that turn into trains and dinos too, and a perfect shiny polished fossilized rock to add to his collection. Of course we finished off our day time there, as we always do, watching a penny or two or three spin 'round and round before they dropped into a base.</p>
<p>Riku sang all the way home, in a very loud voice once more, with the window down and having us join in. He made up silly words to "Do Re Mi" and made Gail and me memorize them, and then sing them independently, laughing so much when we substituted sillier words for his silly words. What a character he is! I'm not sure his parents are going to appreciate this loud and outgoing singer-personality he has developed lately! </p>
<p>We stopped at Rainbow for a few groceries. Riku went in with the men, and even brought back two pieces of cheese samples on one toothpick, telling us it was really good cheese, and also telling us too late that he really liked it, and if we didn't want it, he would eat it. As soon as we got home, I got dinner preparations going, while he and Gail started in on yet another Play-Doh project. I got photos of course! </p>
<p>Riku really enjoyed the nine-grain bean loaf we had for Thanksgiving dinner, so he had that along with the rest of the mac and cheese he didn't finish last night, a custard bowl full of mixed veggies, and some of my baked potato. He was drawing during dinner, not something he usually does at dinner time, but he was happy doing so, and I am happy seeing him draw.</p>
<p>Gail and I have been having a friendly "competition" trying to get Riku to give us his paintings. Gail makes her case by telling Riku that I get all the paintings he does when she is not here (which is true), <strong>but</strong> I have such a hard time not keeping every one of them, and I tend to lose out here, as Riku sees her point and tells me she is right. Bah, humbug! Gail was given the one this morning, and then he decided to give her the one he drew tonight as well. Not fair! He told us to each choose a number and she chose "four", the right one. I loved it, as it was the first time he drew a lion and the entire drawing was so detailed, but I get to take a photo of it, and Riku thought that was fine. He did promise me, though, that tomorrow he would make me another with a lion and a cloud covering part of the sun as well, as I liked it so much. </p>
<p>Riku had some pumpkin pie for dessert and by 6 P.M. was splashing happily in the tub. He had some time on the computer, "drawing" using the Crayola site, then read to me, had a yogurt and some grapes for an extra snack, and after six Shel Silverstein poems he was tucked in, asleep at 7:45. I gave him an antihistamine, as I was so very pleased with how the rash had lessened in roughness and in redness. Fingers crossed that it is an allergy of some kind, and we can figure out what caused it. </p>
<p>Oh, one funny aside... Riku, a few days ago, heard me saying "<strong>Gail Rodgers!</strong>" when she did something I object to (such as insisting that Riku give <strong>her</strong> his drawings, and he has picked up on that in exactly the same tone. So, when she raises her eyebrows, or "talks" back to me, or pretends she can't hear me by putting her hands over her ears, Riku pipes up with "<strong>Gail Rodgers!</strong>" and sounds exactly like me. It's the funniest thing, and tonight he started in on "<strong>Lynne Rodgers!</strong>" so I am likely to be hearing that for the next few months! </p>
<p>Gail had the kitchen all tidied up when I came out from tucking Riku in, and we had two cups of hot tea, a piece of pie (I had yummy walnut pie that Susan had bought for us the day before yesterday, and Gail had pumpkin) and played three games of cards. </p>
<p>Lazy night around here, with just one more night with Riku before his parents and sister arrive home. </p>
