								<h2>Ocean Beach!.. and Riku's "To-Do" List of Ten</h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 7:40 this morning, giving him twelve hours of sleep exactly last night. He was sleeping so soundly that when I woke at 7 A.M. that I left him sleeping and got up to write a couple of emails while the house was quiet. Then I joined him when he called out, and we lay in bed talking and snuggling. Uncle Mark called while we were in chatting and Riku talked to Caillie, who was in Parry Sound visiting her grandparents, who were celebrating their 50th anniversary with a party today. He and Caillie discussed their favourite parts of the movie "Bolt" as well. </p>
<p>After that Riku asked "What is the plan for today?", so I filled him in on some of the things we could do and those we had to do. So, before getting out of bed, we had this plan: 1) Ocean Beach 2) draw me two pictures 3) piano practice 4) Christmas gift for Auntie Kelly and Uncle Gregg  5) one page of homework due Tuesday 6) start decorating for Christmas 7) watch "The Sound of Music" 8) hmmmmm, I just cannot remember these last two, and to my surprise, neither could Riku when I asked him the next day! We both said them several times too, holding up our thumbs and fingers to point each one of them out. I might come up with them yet! </p>
<p>It was interesting to do this list with him, as he decided on his own to play the piano for us while we, the adults, ate breakfast and he ended up playing for more than the usual twenty minutes. This was because he played the pieces we liked the best more than once, and often three times. I taped him today, as he was just enjoying himself, and then spent fifteen minutes trying to get Gail and I to stay in tune while he sat at the table with us, and one of his piano books. Helpless cause! But we sure had fun, and had him laughing out loud. </p>
<p>About a half hour before we left for the beach Riku told me he wanted  to do his homework, even though he had said earlier he would do it in the afternoon. I think he liked being able to make these decisions, and then having them out of the way. </p>
<p>He played with a big container of joining pieces working his way around the house with them, drew one of my two pictures for me, and kept himself busy at his desk for the longest time as well. He ate a late breakfast, after snacking his way through the usual breakfast time, and so I packed up a hearty snack to have at the beach. What a perfect beach day this was! He, Gail, and I spent two plus hours there, walking a long long way up to the far end, searching for shells, and not having any luck at all. It was the worst day ever in fact as he found only one broken sand dollar and a broken tiny shell. However, the tide was way out, and as it rushed in, it left "islands" we could get to by wading into the water. The sun was sparkling on the waves, which were huge today, and we just walked and enjoyed all the dogs trying to catch the gulls, along with all the other hundreds of people just taking in the warm sunshine. Heaven for all of us! </p>
<p>Grandpa watched part of "The Sound of Music" with Riku just a few minutes after we arrived home. Gail and I made tea, and shared a sandwich, while playing three games of cards. The movie is much too long to watch in one sitting, but when I went up to tell Riku he had five minutes until tub time, he told me he has just seen them singing "Do Re Mi" and could stop right away. He said he wanted a five minute tub, so we could get busy decorating, but instead he chose to just lie in the warm tub relaxing for about twenty minutes, playing with just two squirting toys while he lay there. </p>
<p>Doug and Tom went off to Hampshire Street to return the keyboard, all ready for Riku's lesson tomorrow, and Gail and I put dinner on the table. Riku ate as soon as it was ready, and enjoyed his asparagus ravioli with tomato sauce so much that he told me it was "so good" and "delicious" after each bite! And then he told me he liked Gai's and my mushroom ravioli too. He had two generous helpings of veggies as well, and was all set to decorate! </p>
<p>Earlier Gail and I had washed the windows and cleared the shells off the top shelf, so Riku was all set to stick the snowflake decorations up with me. He even counted them on each window to make sure they were evenly dispersed. They look great and we shall continue decorating each time he is over. Riku so enjoys this season, and is just so excited about it all. He chose an Advent calendar too, so he will open the first window tomorrow. </p>
<p>Riku was tucked in and asleep at 7:40 tonight, smelling of the coconut shampoo he likes so much. Me too. This is our last night together after ten wonderful days with him. Tomorrow I will walk him to school, and no doubt his mom will pick him up. And we will possibly have some time with Mirei tomorrow! She will be a very tired girl after her long trip. </p>
<p>Gail and I ate our salad once I came out of Riku's room, I finished off my red wine from Australia that Tom had opened last night, and then it was tea time and cards. How the days fly by!  </p>
