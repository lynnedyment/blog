								<h2>A Quiet Day before the Very Long Holiday Weekend</h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 7 this morning, giving us time to snuggle under the duvet and read the last half of the story we started yesterday. We stayed in bed for a half hour, and then got busy with the usual breakfast routine. Gail sat with him at the table while he drew a picture for her, and then looked at the map of the world to find Australia. While he was at it, he found Japan, Vancouver, Ontario, and Hawaii too. </p>
<p>I walked him to school and had the sliced olives with me for their Thanksgiving lunch. I didn't realize he didn't need a regular lunch today, as they were making up a pasta dish with all sorts of veggies added to it, fresh fruit and juice, as each child contributed something. Riku told Gail and me later that he didn't eat the olives but ate some of the coloured spiral pasta. </p>
<p>Gail and I enjoyed yummy dippy eggs with sourdough toast, and hot cups of tea for our breakfast. She was really hungry today, no doubt because it was dinner time in Australia or something like that! Doug and Tom went off at 11 A.M. to Berkeley to pick up a case of corn relish for Doug, wander the book and record stores, and enjoyed lunch at "Barney's" as well. Tom was very impressed with it, and they didn't even manage to finish the shared order of fries. They do make very large "burgers" there, and Tom said there was so much breast of chicken in his that he had to cut it off the edges in order to eat it! Yup, America knows how to super-size all right! </p>
<p>Gail and I finished up all the laundry by noon hour, including all the ironing, and a couple of pieces of mine. Then we treated ourselves to a game of cards before Gail went to put their clothes away, and get the suitcases sorted out for storage in the store room for the next twelve days. That was a huge job as they had four big full cases, with lots of paperwork, etc. to go through. Gail also tossed some clothes she won't wear again, and I started wrapping Christmas gifts for the children! It felt so good to be getting at that, as it gives me some idea what I have for them and what I need. I didn't get it all done, but a good start for sure, as it was time to pick Riku up. </p>
<p>He seemed just a little less his usual happy self today; even Gail noticed it. He may not have eaten enough at lunch with that mixed dish, so I gave him the half "meat" sandwich for his snack, along with chocolate soy milk and a big container of grapes, all of which disappeared very quickly. For a treat I allowed him to watch a movie; no homework and no school tomorrow, so it was time for a "light" week day. Gail made tea and brought it up for us, as we all sat on the bed and watched "Cinderella 2". Riku enjoys these sweet movies very much; I just love to watch his face as he sits with a smile on his face, and frequently laughs out loud at the antics of the mice, or a funny personality. It was lovely and relaxing for all of us, and Riku was snuggled up beside me the entire time. Watching movies with children is the best excuse in the world to just completely relax! </p>
<p>Grandpa had a couple of interesting things to show to Riku on the computer, and then it was time for piano practice. For the first time, his heart just wasn't in it tonight; he seemed tired out, even though he slept for over eleven hours last night. I wonder if he is going through a growth spurt as he is eating huge amounts of food lately. Gail can't believe how much mushroom risotto he ate last night, plus two custard cups full of veggies, and tonight he ate a double portion of lasagna, with the usual two generous servings of vegetables again. This morning he asked for a piece of sourdough toast as soon as he had finished his fruit plate, and then ate his cereal as well. Gail thought he had grown taller just since she saw him in August, and I'm sure he is going to go through another spurt soon, at this rate of calories going in! </p>
<p>However, he managed to get through twenty minutes of practice tonight, and even voluntarily did the last song three times. He just didn't want to do the really hard two pieces more than once, which was fine for today. I read four books at the table while Riku, Gail, and Tom ate, and then while I ate, Gail read several stories in a book he hasn't heard for a while... the Mike Mulligan steam shovel book. That little head was just drooping by this time, and as soon as he ate his second big helping of grapes for dessert, after refusing his favourite coconut pineapple ice cream(!), he told me he was tired and wanted to go to bed. We got ready in record time and soon I was reading a dozen or so Shel Silverstein poems to him. At 7:35 I walked out of his room. I'm so glad he has three week days off school coming up, plus the weekend! </p>
<p>Gail and I had a very productive evening. We played one game of cards and enjoyed a last cup of hot tea for the day, and then went into their front bedroom and sorted through six bags of children's toys and clothing. In less than an hour we had the front hall filled with bags to go to various places tomorrow. I'm not sure when we will do this, but perhaps first thing in the morning just to have that big job finished up! I called one of my doula moms and her husband will come by for two bags of toys and clothing for their three boys. </p>
<p>I saved a few things for a doula mom expecting in January, and another lot of toys for Sheila's little girl Shashi, who visited with us on Friday. And of course I just had to save a few special things that belonged to one of the grandchildren. Perhaps next time I go through them I will feel I can part with them, but I have learned through the process of helping Uncle Frank that easy does it works better than a full our assault on our memories. </p>
<p>The last job of the evening was a big one too; together we went through a big grocery bag filled with Riku's school work, some from this year but lots from last year too. Most of it went into recycling but it was worth going through it all in order to save the gems. </p>
<p>And now it's bedtime... once again well past what would be ideal for these busy days. It's almost midnight, so goodnight! </p>
