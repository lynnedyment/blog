								<h2>A Visit with Sheila and Shashi</h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 7 A.M. today, and decided that we just had to read the next chapter in "My Daddy's Dragon". He is quite taken with the story about islands and danger, and of course a dragon. We may have time to read a second chapter book at this rate! </p>
<p>We had a very relaxed breakfast / getting-ready-for-school time, and left the house at 8:30 on the dot. It was a gorgeous morning, with blue skies and birds singing, both of which Riku noted on the way up the steps. We went over some of his spelling words on the way to school, but he has  them covered with no effort at all on his part. I love the big hugs I get when I leave him at his classroom! </p>
<p>Bryn IM'd to say they had a very good flight with Mirei, who slept for perhaps 20% of the flight and was a happy girl for 100% of it! Amazing! They were going off to dinner with the family in Osaka, and then it was bedtime for them all after that. A little while later, I heard from him again, as he was wide awake at 3 A.M. in Japan. </p>
<p>Finn arrived for a visit with me at 9:30, nodding his head and saying "yeah!" when I asked if he wanted to sweep in the garden. However, after waving goodbye to his mom from the front window, he changed his mind and said "book!" so we sat down and went through about five lift-the-flap books. Some books he likes to read more than once, and he's very clear about his decision on this. If it's done, down it goes; otherwise, he keeps it in his hand and starts in from the first page again. Today he went through the little album Kelly made for me and pointed out his mom and sister to me. </p>
<p>I fed him a big breakfast of oatmeal, banana, and strawberries while he played with the magnetic stacking toy. As one might expect, he loves to build it up high and then laughs out loud when he knocks it over. "Uh oh!" he says when this happens and I pick it all up so he can start over. We spent the next hour in the garden where he does exactly what I do. If I'm sweeping leaves, he's right behind me; if I stop to pick up pine needles to put them in the compost, he does the same. It's adorable! And when his mom came to fetch him at noon, he had just spotted the hose and knew exactly how to get the water to come out of it! </p>
<p>I was expecting Sheila, one of my doula moms from last March to show up in the late morning. It would have been fun for her to see a busy almost-two-year-old, but she took a wrong bus, and didn't arrive until after 1 o'clock. However, it gave Doug time to book tickets for Riku and me to see "The Nutcracker Suite" on December the 28th, the same day that Bryn told me later in the day that Akane's sister and brother-in-law will arrive from Japan for a six-day visit. I sat down to read a bit, while waiting for Sheila to arrive, and was hungry enough by that time that I noshed on two of the tofu pieces Susan had picked up from Japantown, along with some other goodies... inari, sugared black beans, and yummy sweet potatoes.</p>
<p>I went out on the street to meet up with Sheila and the baby; what a cutie she is, and Sheila as lovely as ever. I got lots of smiles from that little girl right away, and of course I like to think it's because she saw me within a minute of being born. I took lots of photos of her, of course, and how sweet that she was wearing the little t-shirt I gave her the day she left the hospital. I gave her another today  to match her little cotton pants she was wearing. </p>
<p>Baby Shashi sat in the high chair while her mommy and I ate our lunch. Shashi quite enjoyed a few black beans too, and took great delight in looking around, getting used to new faces and lots of new things to look at. She is such a good baby, and luckily Sheila knows it! She has been sleeping through the night since she was a new baby, and even had to be wakened to nurse during those first few weeks! It was lovely having time to just sit and chat with Sheila, and hold and play with Shashi. </p>
<p>She had just gone down for her nap when I arrived home with Riku, and he was very happy to have company in the house. He set right to work digging out some more bones from his dino kit, and uncovered several new ones, his biggest number in one sitting to date. He did his piano practice, with Sheila watching, and then he played again for Shashi when she woke up. </p>
<p>She quite enjoyed tinkling away on the keys and watched Riku with big smiles. He was sweet as could be with her, giving Sheila a tiny bird to take home for her, and he made a special toilet paper roll, carefully decorated with lots of colourful stickers for Shashi's first birthday! He even copied Shashi's name down on a piece of paper so that he would remember her name. Such a guy is our boy! Riku loves babies just as much as his Nana, Auntie Kelly, and his daddy do, and I told him he was going to be a wonderful daddy one day. I hope I'm around to see this...</p>
<p><br />
Riku and Doug watched two episodes of "Harold and the Purple Crayon" while I had some extra time with my guests, and when they left at 5 o'clock, I quickly got dinner on the table. I enjoy having Riku read to me right after dinner, as he isn't too tired at that point, and he's had a break. He seems to enjoy it too, and today he read "Put Me in the Zoo", again with such enthusiasm and expression when he sees all those exclamation points! It's a joy hearing him read so well. </p>
<p>Riku had a half hour of play time, which he spent with the action figures from Auntie Candy and Uncle Rick, before heading into the bathroom for the usual night-time routine. We read "The Man Who Lived in a Hat", a story about a very greedy man who was never satisfied, which lead to some discussion about the man not knowing when he should have been happy, and then we read one more chapter in the current book, leading us wondering what was going to happen next. Riku settled into sleep very quickly tonight, and was asleep by 7:45. Unfortunately, after checking the time, I rolled over to snuggle him for another minute and fell fast asleep for a half hour, something I have rarely done. Not good either, as I always feel groggy and worse, rather than better, after a nap.</p>
<p>Doug and I had planned to watch a movie, but settled instead for a taped TV show. I wrote a few emails and read a long chapter in my book "Pillars of the Earth" before turning the light out at 11:45 P.M. </p>
