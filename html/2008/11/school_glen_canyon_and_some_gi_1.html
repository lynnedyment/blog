								<h2>School, Glen Canyon, and some Gifts Too!</h2>
								<p>I woke up at 7 A.M. today to hear Riku lying beside me quietly muttering the same lines over and over. in no particular order  "I don't WANT to go to school today." "It's the weekend and I don't want to go to school on the weekend!" "I hate going to school." "It's not fair; I go to school in the week... " and on and on it went. I didn't say a word for the longest time, just lay there pretending to be sleeping. When I did open my eyes, I asked him what he was saying, and he told me that no one else had to go to school on the weekend. Of course I told him that every child in his Japanese school was getting ready to go to school, and that we had some time to read before getting up. He suggested another two chapters in his book, and that was the end of that discussion. He bounced out of bed at the end of the chapters and we got on with our day.</p>
<p>Riku opened the last of the two gifts from Candy and Rick this morning... two more action figures from Star Wars. He was thrilled to bits with them and sat at the table until breakfast was ready playing happily with them and the two from yesterday. He then wrote a lovely thank you note to them, ate a great breakfast and got ready to walk out the door with Doug at 8:40. As he was leaving, after kissing me goodbye, he said quietly "I love you Nana. I don't know what else to say." He said this very same thing many many months ago, and I find it so touching. He looks so sincere and it's said with such sweetness... talk about a heartbreaker! </p>
<p>I jumped in the shower, had breakfast, called Beth to see how her knee was feeling after surgery on Tuesday.. she's still really sore, and busied myself easily with a few household chores, before leaving to pick Riku up at noon hour. </p>
<p>He ate his snack in the car, and we stopped in Noe Valley for his long overdue haircut. Bing, my favourite gal, was busy so MiMi cut Riku's and did a great job with it. We stopped in at Walgreen's to wander around the aisles looking at Christmas items as Riku is very fond of Walgreen's, but he ended up with just two small packages of M&Ms as nothing was very appealing to him. He ate perhaps half a dozen of the candies and then turned them over to me. This child is just not a candy eater, unlike his little sister who would happily have eaten the entire package at a sitting. </p>
<p>We stopped in at the house for a half hour so he could eat a bit more, and play with his Lego, before heading out for a walk in Glen Park Canyon. We had talked about going to Ocean Beach today, but I was concerned about Riku falling asleep if we ended up there after a long walk on the beach, and we had just driven from that area already from school. Riku agreed that it made more sense to go tomorrow, so that is the plan.</p>
<p>Doug came with us to Glen Park and Riku convinced him to climb up a very steep hill with him so they could wave from the rocks at the top. The photo doesn't do the hill any justice at all, as it was very high, and I deleted several photos of the two of them leaning over as they walked up holding hands. I happily stayed down below for the photo shoot! Riku and Doug both found temporary walking sticks, went exploring and we all had a grand ol' time. There were lots of folks out, and dogs too, enjoying the sunshine and the blue sky. </p>
<p>It was just cooling down when we were ready for a trip to Target. Riku had a $25 birthday gift card plus an extra $20 besides, and thoroughly enjoyed taking his time picking out the perfect combination of gifts. He ended up with a large set of "Alien Infiltrators", plus a smaller one of an "Astro Fighter" in the Mars Mission series. With three dollars still left to spend, he decided on two craft items... sparkly pipe cleaners and a bag full of multi-colored shiny sequins, perfect for so many things! He walked out proudly carrying the bags himself and kept them in the back seat with him all the way home too. </p>
<p>After a little time checking them all out at home, it was time for piano practice. I enjoy sitting there watching him play, and am amazed at how often he plays the same tune two or three times until he feels it is right. I have a couple of favourite and must record them one day this week.  Riku also typed a note to his daddy on IM, carefully pecking out the letters as I spelled words to him; he told Bryn about his purchases and we had a little message from Bryn saying they were off to stay at a hotel in Osaka soon. </p>
<p>Riku claimed he didn't want a bath, but I know it relaxes him, and despite telling me he wanted to stay in for only five minutes to get the loose hairs off him, he played for twenty and then got busy putting together his Lego "fighter". He did the entire kit on his own, and proudly showed it off to Doug, who was duly impressed with his building and following directions skills! </p>
<p>Riku decided he would like breakfast for dinner tonight, and I happily obliged with two scrambled eggs, two slices of "bacon", a slice of whole wheat toast, and a good sized portion of broccoli and steamed carrots. I am amazed at how much he eats so willingly these days; he must be going through a growth spurt for sure! Once his kit was completed he happily settled in and did four pages of his homework, all easy for him and time intensive as he had to write sentences. He is very methodical about it all, carefully crossing off the words he puts into the sentences before moving on. We also did his spelling words twice in the car, and he read "Ten Apples up on Top" to me once the regular homework was done. The one thing he didn't do was make another of the little gifts he started on yesterday, but we decided he could do two in the morning. </p>
<p>Riku's story tonight was two chapters of his book, and we can't wait to see what happens tomorrow when the main character, a young boy, meets the lion! </p>
<p>That was our day... I'm off to bed to read my book. I'm looking forward to not having a deadline tomorrow morning... we'll just relax and go with the day, seeing how it unfolds. </p>
