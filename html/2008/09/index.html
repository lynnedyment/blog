								<h2><a href="/2008/09/im_a_princess_1.html">"I'm a Princess!"</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei loves the colour pink. She will always choose something pink to wear, she notices other people wearing pink, will point out pink socks, houses, garages, curtains, flowers, fruit, etc. and of course loves pink ice cream and pink yogurt! </p>
<p>We picked up a very happy girl from "Little Angels" today; she came running out with her big smile and a burst of energy, asking immediately if Grandpa was there too. He was and she called out to him in a big voice from across the road. </p>
<p>We chatted and sang all the way home, and she was delighted when Grandpa drove past her favourite very pink house. That way we could talk about "pink!" and what our favourite colours were once more. After a snack of custard ... not pink but a favourite right now anyway, Mirei had a nice long nap, cuddled on top of her soft pink blanket. </p>
<p>I had bought a lovely little dress-up dress for her in the early summer, and decided today was the day to give it to her. It's a size three, but there isn't too much time before she will be gone, and not around to wear it where I can admire it too. </p>
<p>Well, what a hit this dress was! As soon as we had our usual snuggle after she woke, and read a few stories in the living room, I asked her if she would like to put on something new. How her eyes lit up when she saw it, and I wish I had taken a movie of her wearing it! I will the next time she puts it on, as it was adorable. </p>
<p>First she had to look at herself in the mirror, then show it off to Grandpa, who was very impressed with how she could swirl it, twirl in it and lift it up behind her! He told her she looked just like a princess, and that was it! She told me she was a princess, she told the little girl in the mirror she was a princess and she told Grandpa too! </p>
<p>It was such fun to see how much she enjoyed being a girl, especially a girl in a very special pink dress. </p>
<p>(It was too cool for her to wear it outside while we waited for her Daddy to pick it up, but we shall arrange for a special showing at some point in October.) </p>
