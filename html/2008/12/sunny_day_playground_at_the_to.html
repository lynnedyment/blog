								<h2>Sunny Day and "Playground at the top of the hill?"</h2>
								<p>Leisurely morning around here today, the first week day morning of the holidays for the children. Bryn sat at the table with Akane and the children, eating scones and drinking tea, before leaving for work earlier than usual. 'Twas lovely not to have to rush through one thing at all... lots of time for drawing (Riku) and puzzles (Mirei) during breakfast, and Akane got some unpacking and sorting done. </p>
<p>It was a sunny day, and so I told the children we should go off to the playground. "Which playground?" Mirei asked, "the playground at the top of the hill?" Yes, that was the one I meant. </p>
<p>This little girl is communicating so very well. This morning Riku called her a little girl, and in a <strong>very</strong> <strong>big</strong> <strong>voice</strong>, not befitting a little girl at all, Mirei announced to all of us that she was <strong>not</strong> a little girl and she was not a baby, but she was a <strong>big</strong> girl now, and she was <strong>three</strong>! She reminded us of this several times, I might say many many times, over the day that she was three. She holds up those three fingers, reiterates that yesterday she was two (holding up two fingers), but today she is <strong>three</strong>, just to make us understand what a big difference this is. </p>
<p>She is very aware of others ages too, holding up five fingers for Amelia, one finger for "baby Finn", and five fingers plus one for Riku. This morning she also told me that "soon I will be four, then five, and then a very big girl." This is true! </p>
<p>Mirei is full of "because" these days, repeated as soon as she tells you she is going to do something. She feels compelled to explain her reasons, perhaps more like her Nana that anyone guessed, so we hear things like "I am going to the bedroom now because I have to get a blanket for my baby. I will be right back!" </p>
<p>Mirei has an unfailing ear for language; I will say something to her, she picks up on the one word she doesn't know and promptly asks "what that word means?" I must tape some of her conversations soon, as her language skills just blows all of us away. Akane says this is true in Japanese as well, and amazes her with how much she knows, and how well she explains herself. Mirei just really pays attention to detail, and so she repeats it once out loud, and she's got it.  </p>
<p>So, off we went to the playground, and had such a good time. We were the first ones there today, so I chased Riku, his favourite thing of all, and admired Mirei climbing up the straight steps carefully to follow Riku on the above ground play equipment. They both spent quite a bit of time on the swings, and Riku hung from the monkey bar grips for the first time ever, or at least for the longest time ever. </p>
<p>Home for a snack an hour and a half later, then Riku's piano lesson at noon. His teacher told Akane she is giving him so much practice homework, and moving him along so quickly, because he is a very good student and she feels he can easily do it. How nice to hear this, as we too think he is doing so well. </p>
<p>We had lunch after that, Riku worked on his latest Lego kit building, another complicated one with 312 pieces in all!, and Mirei busied herself with her babies, the cradle, and the stroller. Being a mommy is a lot of work!  She loves to sit in the cradle too, and has made herself quite a nice little play area in my kitchen, meaning we step over lots of things on our way to the laundry room and the table! Now her "treasure trunk" from "Little Angels" has been added to her furniture. </p>
<p>Akane and Mirei left at 1:30 for the apartment, so that Akane could pack up some food items and empty the fridge. Riku had an appointment to see Dr. Solomon at 2:45, to check out his blocked sinuses (with what we thought must be an infection), and his bottom, which continues to break out, never quite healing, despite various treatments. </p>
<p>Dr. Solomon is so wonderful with Riku, speaks directly to him, and asks permission before doing anything at all. Riku is just fine with having his ears checked, takes nice deep breaths when his chest and back are being listened to, and is even comfortable about having his bottom looked at. Dr. Solomon told Riku that he thought he would make a fine doctor one day. While we were waiting to see him, we read two books, one on dinosaurs, and one on the heart, both with lots of interesting information. He remembered enough to tell his dad at dinner that there are more red cells in the body than there are stars in the Milky Way galaxy! </p>
<p>We stopped at Costco on the way home, and Riku was happy to wander around and get a few samples (as were Doug and I!) We stocked up on lots of bananas, tiny seedless oranges, and got in some nice cheeses for the Boxing Day party we have planned. Riku had spotted someone with a big box of pizza on the way in... I saw it too, and he asked if we could have pizza for dinner, just a plain one. So we looked and couldn't fine just a cheese pizza, but I did buy him a slice of plain at their counter, while Doug checked out. He said it was "just okay" when I asked how it was, but after five or six bites he had had enough. </p>
<p>We stopped at Hampshire Street to pick up Akane and Mirei, stopped at Walgreen's to drop off a prescription for cream for Riku, and then home for dinner. Both children were very tired and we decided an early tuck-in time was just what was needed. I ran the tub, and Mirei had a quick tub before dinner; she had a surprise birthday phone call from Caillie, who thought we were celebrating her family birthday tonight, but we will be doing this tomorrow instead. Caillie could not get over how well she is speaking. </p>
<p>Riku had a quick bath after dinner, just before bedtime. Dr. Solomon had suggested that I tip his head back and allow a few drops of saline solution to help clear those sinus passages. I am always so amazed at how willing Riku is to allow some of these things; he makes no fuss at all when I syringe his ears with a whole bulb of warm water, and tonight he was nonplussed at having water dropped up into his nose! What a guy! I always tell him how proud I am of him, as I know most children would just not allow it, never mind so easily agree to having it done. </p>
<p>He was too tired to read to Bryn, so instead he and I snuggled and read the book from Auntie Kelly and family, "How to Draw a Bird". He loves it, and I'm not surprised, as the artist in him surely appreciates the drawings in the book, and his active imagination enjoys the story. It took all of five minutes for Riku to drift off into sleep.I tiptoed out of his room at 7:30 and Akane left Mirei sleeping at 7:45. </p>
<p>Bryn had gone over to the apartment to pack, and Doug, Akane, and I had a quiet evening at home. I should be doing Christmas cards, but knowing they aren't going to make it before Christmas has taken the pressure off this year. I will send them off though, eventually, and soon, as I have the cards made of Riku's art, and want to share them with friends and relatives who know him and his love of drawing. </p>
<p>At the end of my evening, I had an email in from Susan, along with a "painting" Finn had done on the computer. He told his mommy it was "for Nana"; it's great, with lots of bright greens, blues and purple swirled together. Sweet! </p>
