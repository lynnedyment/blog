								<h2>Vacaville, an Outlet Kind of Day!</h2>
								<p>Today was a "day off" for Gail and me, a day out of the house, and with no housework on the agenda. Doug and I haven't been to Vacaville for many months, and it's a fun place for Gail and Tom to browse around in when they're here. However, in the past they been here when the weather was warmer so today's chilly climes were not expected. Brrr. The first thing I bought was a warm vest, replacing one I lost a few years ago; it was just what I needed under my too-light jacket to be comfortable wandering in and out of the stores. We were surprised to find empty parking lots this close to Christmas, and learned that the only good day the stores have had recently was on "Black Friday", and not even the two days following. One of the biggest stores is closing out by Christmas, and with the dearth of customers one could see why. I didn't buy much either, although found a few fun Christmas items for the house... a wind-up Santa and tree, another set of mini-muffin pans, and sprinkles for the sugar cookies I will be making with the children.  </p>
<p>Gail and Tom treated us to lunch at "Fresh Choice" and we were ready to eat early, at 11:30, after a light breakfast at 8:30. It was delicious, as always, and my salad plate was piled high enough that I didn't even end up going up for my usual baked potato or cornmeal muffin! It was good to have another few hours to walk off the calories! </p>
<p>Gail and Tom found some of the items they were after, and a few fun gifts for the children too, which they will give them before they leave. Gail was looking for a new rain jacket, and has been for some time, so Doug suggested stopping on the way home at the North Face outlet store in Berkeley, and she found one she liked almost immediately. The colour is great and the fit perfect, so she was one happy camper! Tom was not so fortunate, and will have to keep looking for his replacement in Vancouver. We also stopped for some sourdough bread and milk at Berkeley Bowl before heading home over the Bay Bridge. It was great to see the usual Christmas lights on several buildings as we crossed the bridge, as they always remind us of beautifully wrapped gifts. </p>
<p>We arrived home about 7 P.M., tired and relaxed after all the walking and fresh air, but we had bags of things to put away, Gail heated up some leftovers for Doug and Tom. Just as they were finishing up their dinner (neither Gail nor I were hungry, so shared a big pomegranate and ate an orange each), Bryn called to ask if they would like to join him at the movies... the new James Bond film. Less than eight minutes later they were out the door! </p>
<p>Gail made a pot of tea, and we enjoyed hot cuppas along with a few games of cards, enjoying the quiet time alone. I talked to Patrizia, whose little one year has been ill since Saturday. She and her husband are understandably quite worried about him, and we talked about her options, hoping tomorrow will be a better day for him. </p>
<p>I wanted to get something done in the house, as there is so much to do before Akane, Bryn, and the children move in next week some time, so I took a big stack of my unread books off a two drawer stand in one of the spare bedrooms, giving them so flat space in the room, and emptied the drawers for them. I still have a bit more to do in that room, but it's coming along, thanks to Gai's help. Gail and I took some time to stop and read about a dozen or more very old postcards I bought at an antique shop last year in Niagara Falls, all written in the early 1900s! One day I hope to have them all in albums, in the appropriate years. </p>
<p>Bryn popped in to say hello to us, and chatted for a bit before heading home. We had one more game of cards and then went off to bed. </p>
