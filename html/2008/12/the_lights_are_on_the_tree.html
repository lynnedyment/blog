								<h2>The Lights are on the Tree!</h2>
								<p>Today was a busy-around-the-house day, getting the front bedroom cleaned and cleared out completely for Bryn and Akane's arrival. Doug did a great job washing the windows inside and out, not an easy task in this old and tall house! </p>
<p>Perhaps the children will end up sleeping in the twin beds, and not in the smaller, darker middle bedroom, but there are now three big empty drawers free for them. All the CM products that were under the bed and in two of the three drawers are now upstairs in a storage space under our bed. And in making space there, I cleared away lots of items for giveaway to various places. So, all in all, a very productive day! I also decorated the </p>
<p>Riku called this morning, upset, but I could hear Bryn reminding him in the background that he had a great morning, and within a couple of minutes Bryn had him giggling away. He uses me as his sounding board and always tells Grandpa in a sad voice that he wants to talk to me. I am always glad I am here, as I think he often just needs to talk it out. </p>
<p>Candy called and we had a very long natter (as Mom would have said), and later in the day Gail wrote to say she had almost unpacked and put away all the things from their four big suitcases. What a big job that was, but Gail is happy to get home and will be happy to be settled in once more. </p>
<p>I left with Riku's snack and my camera at 2:30, and met up with Riku in the hallway. We walked to the bathroom together, and I watched the door for him. He isn't very comfortable going to the bathroom without an adult at school and I have noticed he often is anxious to get home to use the one at home. I think there are some children there who push or peek under the door, or perhaps Riku has heard of such things and doesn't want any part of it. </p>
<p>We sat outside the front of the school, on a seat that goes around a tree, for his snack time. As soon as we sat down, Riku pulled out a piece of scrap paper on which he had drawn a number of Chinese characters. He told me that one of the lines said he loved me, and when Miss Chan walked by, she asked him if he had told me what he said... and read out "I love my grandmother." He tells me all the time and so I know it's true.  :) </p>
<p>Riku knows lots of the children who come out the door with a parent, and often leans over to tell me in a quiet voice "he is in grade two." or "Her name is Sarah and she's in the other grade one." Today the kindergarten teacher he had for English, Miss Chan, the same one above was moving some things into her car. She is always so very nice with Riku, often patting him on the head as she passes by, but always giving him a lovely smile and says "hello" in her very quiet voice. She is expecting a baby next spring and Riku wishes he could see that baby when it is born, but no doubt he will already by in Japan. </p>
<p>As we walked by her car, Riku whispered to me "I think she is very soft and warm. Also she is very sweet." and a few feet ahead, even though she had gone back into the school by then he said "I hope she didn't hear me." I reassured him that even if she had heard him, what he said would make her very happy. </p>
<p>Riku often skips down the hills, and fills me in on his day. He had lots to tell me today and we were home before we knew it! Mirei was there, of course, and wearing pink panties... no diapers. She is doing very well with her potty training and this is perhaps the last step before she "gets" it. Once again she asked if I would stay and play with her, and Riku asked too. So off the three of us went to their bedroom, where Riku kept busy with his Lego monsters, asking me which one was the good guy and which the bad, and Mirei buzzed around bending over backwards, and playing with her "cell" phone. I stayed perhaps a half hour and Akane and the children waved goodbye to me as usual from the front window. </p>
<p>I relaxed for a bit with an Oprah tape, a cup of tea, an orange and an apple, and then had a baked eggroll for an extra bit of dinner. Not too hungry these days, but I'm keeping busy and not thinking too much about what to eat. I had a hard boiled egg earlier so wasn't too hungry at all. </p>
<p>Doug had put the star on our tree, before going to T'ai Chi... a "new" old star from Bryn, who bought it, and some wonderful ornaments on EBay last year. When Doug returned from his class we put the lights on, using four strings of the old-fashioned kind, twice as many as on our usual sized tree. It took quite a long time, but it looks just beautiful and while Doug placed the reflectors on some of the lights, and strung the garland 'round and 'round, I added a few more Santas to the mantle, and added some other figurines to the table in the hallway from the box that Bryn brought over. I am sitting here now looking at this big gorgeous tree, beautifully lit, and the lit Santa figure from Doug's childhood, sitting on the washstand in the dining room. It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas around here! </p>
<p>Riku called again before his bedtime and then again almost an hour later; I told him we could decorate the tree tomorrow, or at least start on it, as we will want to do it all together on the weekend, finishing it up then. For now, I am very happy to have it lit and cheerful looking in the living room. How I love a real tree, and this one is our biggest one ever! </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a Canadian sitcom "Slings and Arrows" and what a treat it has been.</p>
<p>Off to bed at 11:30... I think it will be a Finn morning tomorrow! </p>
