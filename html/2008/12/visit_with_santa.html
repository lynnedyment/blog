								<h2>Visit with Santa</h2>
								<p>A little boy with very cold feet and hands crawled into bed with me this morning! Doug was still sleeping, and Riku was so very quiet, whispering to me, asking me what the plans are for today, but mostly just snuggling up and getting warm. Then we came downstairs and crawled into his bed to read, and eat the fruit bowl Bryn had made up for him. I showered while the family of four was eating breakfast, and then we waved goodbye to Bryn when he left for work. </p>
<p>I had been planning on taking Riku and Mirei to see Santa this week specifically, but somehow in my head there was no rush, as long as we did so before the weekend. I hadn't actually looked at a calendar or discussed it with anyone, but this morning, after deciding today was <strong>the</strong> day, it hit me that tomorrow is Christmas Eve! Yikes! Santa is probably on his way to the North Pole at some point tomorrow, and all those folks who were putting off seeing him, would no doubt be lined up for those photos with him today. </p>
<p>We left the house at 10:30, hoping it would be early enough that we wouldn't have too long a wait. The parking lot had lots of open spaces, much to our surprise, and we realized just how much the change in the economy has hit our city. Doug and I haven't been out shopping much at all this year, since the economy has certainly affected our budgetr, but it was shocking to see the change from last year. </p>
<p>Santa was waiting, and there were quite a few people in line with little ones, so Akane wandered off to shop on her own for a bit, and Doug took Mirei for a little walk, as she is far too restless to stand in a line for long. Riku could move around a bit, as he is careful to not get too far from me, and had lots of peeks at Santa. At one point Doug had Mirei close to Santa, but she was a bit shy when he waved to her. Not too much later she had decided she could be friendlier, and then kept trying to get his attention. </p>
<p>One 5x7 photo this year costs $16.99, and so all three of the adults took digital photos only. I feel sorry for all those people who don't have cameras and can't afford this kind of money for the photo with Santa. We did ask permission to take them and  with three of us snapping away, we had a wonderful selection to choose from! He wasn't the most talkative Santa, but he did ask the children what they wanted, and Riku told him Lego and Mirei "a princess!". </p>
<p>It was close to noon when we finished so off we went to the "Olive Garden"; Akane treated us to a delicious lunch, and the children both ate well too. We stopped at the post office to pick up a parcel for Akane from Japan, and then it was home for the afternoon and evening. Riku did two pages of homework, and his piano practice, and Mirei and I made up the dough for some sugar cookies. How this little girl loves to bake! And she loves custard too, and sat enjoying a bowl of it as a treat after I had the sugar dough in the fridge. Oh, Akane also put a new dress on her; it's just darling, and Mirei looked so sweet in it. It just suits her and she spend lots of time admiring herself in the glass door of the lower oven. </p>
<p>Akane made them a noodle dish for dinner, filled with lots of veggies, a dish they both enjoy so much. Bryn was home for dinner as usual with them, and the children told him all about Santa and what they asked for. (Riku had intended asking Santa if his — Santa's — daddy was a Santa too, but decided against it.) </p>
<p>We ended their dinner time listening to Mirei hold court, not an uncommon thing for her. Today her theme was people and their place in the world and family. It was very entertaining to listen to, as she knows of course that Grandpa and Daddy are men, but she also said today they are people. Mommy is a person and a mommy, she herself is a girl and a person, and Riku is a person and a boy. However, I am a Nana and a woman, but <strong>not</strong> a  person! No amount of arguing would persuade her otherwise. It was hilarious but this is not a girl who changes her mind easily once she has made it up! The funniest bit of all was when she was describing Akane once more; she pointed to her and in a very serious and loud voice said "That is my chi chi Mommy!"... chi chi meaning her "nursing mommy"!</p>
<p>The children were both tired, and so it was into bed early for both of them, as soon as the ice cream dessert was over. Riku read to his daddy first, and then I read a book we hadn't read in a long time... "Adele", a book Riku enjoyed just as much as he did the first time we read it.We always say "this is our favourite part of the day" as we turn out the light to snuggle, but we often say it in the mornings too! It's so nice and cozy; lucky us! Riku wraps his arm around my neck, just for a few minutes before he falls asleep, and then rolls over in an immediate deep sleep. I've always been able to go in and take photos of both him and Mirei when they are sleeping, and could occasionally with Amelia too when she was very little. </p>
<p>I tucked Riku in, Akane tucked Mirei into bed in the front room, and both children were asleep by 7:45. Lovely to have a nice long evening to ourselves, although I am feeling very organized this year, with only two more gifts left to wrap!</p>
<p> I went though some photos for blogs and to post on Facebook, and added a few more old family photos to an album on Facebook too. However, it needs some attention as I can only post sixty in an album, and I have almost twice that many. I'm getting lots of responses to them, as so many family members are enjoying them too. Bedtime too late as a result of fiddling around with them! I'll be sorry tomorrow. </p>
