								<h2>Christmas Wrapping, Hail, Gingerbread Smells, and an Overnight Visitor Too!</h2>
								<p>I spent the entire morning wrapping Christmas gifts, not finishing them up yet, and doing the laundry, so the time flew by. The weather has turned frosty, and we had hail, hard big hail for the first time here in a very long time. Brrrrr! It was right at noon hour, and I imagined the children out on their lunch hour, huddled in the cafeteria, looking out in wonder. And I imagined Akane, correctly as well, under the bus shelter waiting for the bus to go and fetch Mirei from nursery school. Neither was out in it, thank goodness, as it would have hurt for sure coming down so hard as it did. </p>
<p>I enjoyed a quiet lunch upstairs with some TV time, just to have a break from the bending all morning over the table. It was a pleasant interlude, and I enjoyed my big cup of hot tea before leaving to get Riku. It was raining hard at 2:30 and I had Doug drive me up to the school, but when the rain slowed down, decided Riku and I would walk home. I think he likes and needs that little interlude between school and home, and of course we both enjoy the walk and talk. </p>
<p>Today Riku asked me about Twinnie and Winnie, his new goldfish, and I told him they seemed fine, if a little lazy for goldfish. They are just hunkering down near the bottom of the tank and don't even swim to the surface when they are fed. </p>
<p>We talked also about choosing to do good things in life or bad things, and how some people do one thing and others go the other way. Interesting conversation with such a little boy, but later Bryn told me that he had been talking to Riku, asking if he would choose good or evil. Riku was busy building something when he was asked, but casually said "good". Then Bryn asked Mirei the same question and without blinking an eye she replied "evil". We laughed so hard; she has no idea what it means but she chose the opposite of what Riku decided on. What a girl! </p>
<p>Riku asked if I would stay at the house with him while he ate his snack and played. I didn't take one along today, knowing there would be no outdoor picnic today, but Akane made him toasted sourdough and cheese, and Mirei ate a little bit too, while they both sat and played at the table.</p>
<p>I left soon after as Bryn had called earlier asking if I could help tuck in Riku at home while he worked here, and later picked Sean up at the airport.  </p>
<p>I was so hungry, so quickly made a veggie burger for myself as soon as I walked in the door. The cold weather makes me hungrier than usual! </p>
<p>It dawned on me once at home that it made more sense for Riku to just sleep here, so he and Bryn arrived around 6, they both ate dinner... I made Riku's, and Akane sent over two dishes for Bryn.</p>
<p>This worked out so well as Riku had some free time to rearrange the mantle one more time. I had found some new Santas to add to the shelf, and they all required (as far as Riku is concerned) those little puffs of clouds on their heads, a big job to get it just right. I noticed this morning that the last time he was here, that Riku had placed one of the tiny China Santas on the roof of a tiny house, as though he were getting ready to climb down the chimney. He certainly has enjoyed the house decorating! </p>
<p>Then it was his tub time, a short one tonight (he was humming Christmas songs the entire time), a few short stories,  a few poems, and tuck in time. He was so stuffy, with infected sinuses, and had trouble falling asleep because of it. I emerged at 8:05 and he fell asleep just before 8, not too bad at all considering our late start at dinner. </p>
<p>I got busy, inspired by the cold night, and made my first batch of gingerbread dough... it's beginning to smell a lot like Christmas! I went through some photos, wrote a few emails, and puttered about in the kitchen getting December birthday cards ready to mail tomorrow.</p>
<p>Bryn left at 10:30 having completed his work, Doug went up to bed not much later, and I stayed up too darned late once again! I enjoy having this quiet time completely on my own, but it takes its toll the next day around dinner time, when I am more tired than would be ideal.</p>
