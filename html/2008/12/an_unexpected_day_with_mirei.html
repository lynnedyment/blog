								<h2>An Unexpected Day with Mirei</h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 7:15 today and the first words out of his mouth were that he didn't want to go to school. He almost always wakens with a smile and his arms wrapped around my warm neck, but today he wanted to complain about his lot in life. Too much homework is his biggest complaint, and for good reason. This current generation has homework in kindergarten whereas their parents and grandparents didn't get any until at least grade three, and even then it was minimal. Amelia complains about it too, and I suspect the majority of children do. Poor wee guy; I do feel for him, but I know once he's there, he's fine. </p>
<p>However, he was reluctant to get out of bed, and finally we agreed to sit in the living room with the lights turned on the tree to read about six poems from our latest Shel' Silverstein book. This made our morning a little more rushed than usual though, so Doug sat at the table with him while he ate and drew, and I got his lunch put together. He drew a fabulous fantasy bird/robot/creature; his drawings always make me happy, and he was his usual cheerful and pleasant self on the way to school. </p>
<p>Today was the day that Akane was going to a potluck luncheon with the moms at Mirei's nursery school "Little Angels", but Mirei is still not well, and so plans changed to have her visit with us here instead. Akane walked her over about 10:30, and even though it was obvious Mirei was not quite her usual self, she was smiling and happy to see me at the door. She had a busy morning too, "feeding" Grandpa lots of goodies from her kitchen, admiring the little lit village, and clapping her hands to make the singing start. Of course she loves the tree, glowing even in the daytime, and knows that she can touch the (LED) lights on the windows but not  the old-fashioned bulbs on the tree. </p>
<p>I wanted to get some food into that empty tummy, and was pleased when she ate a good portion of oatmeal with banana. That went down very well while she drew two pictures for me. She hadn't slept much last night, even though she hadn't vomited after the second time, she was obviously just not well. So, into bed we crawled with four of her favourite Caillou books, carefully chosen from the new spot in the hallway (over Christmas), and we snuggled in to read two of them. Within fifteen minutes of going into the room, I was tiptoeing out, leaving Mirei cuddling a soft dog and a soft cat, chosen from the big baskets of possibilities. </p>
<p>I scanned some photos I want to print, had my lunch, and got some more things organized in our bedroom. I will be so pleased when all the baby and children's clothes have gone to various new homes, as I have far too many for a grandmother to use up! I wish I had time to distribute them individually to my doula moms, and some of them will go to those women for sure. </p>
<p>Mirei napped for two hours, ate about three-quarters of a poached egg with a half slice of dry toast, and that was that. She had a hard time with the last couple of bites of egg, which told me how sick she was, as she can eat two in record time when she is healthy. Today she held each of those bites for the longest time in her mouth, and then quietly said "no more." </p>
<p>I needed a hair cut, so she came along with Doug and me and had a great time. As Doug parked the car, Mirei spotted a giant woman's face hanging from the second floor of a house; it was fascinating to her and she had a good look at it, before I pointed out a fake owl two doors down. Lots to see with Mirei's sharp eyes; she rarely misses a thing, much like her big brother. </p>
<p>I had to wait a half hour for my gal, so Mirei and I strolled slowly up and down a block on 24th Street, stopping to see a train going 'round and 'round the tracks in a window, into a shop filled with lots of World Trade gifts... lovely painted stones, soft felt animals, golden and brightly coloured balls, many of which Mirei could pick up and inspect, which she did. When I showed her a pink roundy rock... it was actually quite lovely, soft soapstone, she said to me "Let's take that home with us." and the clerk smiled. I asked if she would like a plain cookie when we passed the bakery and to my surprise she quietly said "No thank you." This gal knows what she wants in her tummy today, and what she doesn't want. </p>
<p>Doug came to walk her about while I had my hair cut, and they too wandered up and down the street stopping to see whatever caught their eyes. When we were walking back to the car, Mirei decided to pick up a great big dry leaf I had been kicking along. It instantly became a telephone, and she chatted away with Grandpa, and he answered back using his own pretend and invisible phone. I wish I could have taped the conversations as she talked to Riku, her dad, and to her mom too! The leaf also provided lots of entertainment in the car on the way home. But first, we stopped again to have a better look at that big face, and the fellow who lived in the house turned on the lights on his tree and windows for her too, much to her delight. All the way home, she tore off bits of one side of the leaf to "feed" to Grandpa, and occasionally would let me have a piece too. Of course she was passing out "pink!" candies or cookies in her own mind, and Grandpa was pretty full by the time we got home. </p>
<p>Akane picked Riku up from school today, and so we gave them another hour alone together and an extra hour with us for Mirei. I had washed all their soiled bedding, and three of Mirei's sleeper blankets(!) from the night before, and had just enough time to get the last of it dried, into a big bag, and read Mirei two Christmas stories before Doug left to drop her at home at 5:30. She asked if she could borrow "A Baby's First Christmas" to take with her; I like being her own personal lending library. </p>
<p>I made myself a big cup of tea, and treated myself to a solid hour of taped Oprah's; I needed something mindless and quite enjoyed Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett having fun discussing their latest movie, followed by a very entertaining Will Smith talking about his latest movie too. It was just what I needed, although I did a little sorting of children's clothes into sizes after finishing my tea. </p>
<p>Doug came home, we had a light dinner, and then went upstairs to watch two more episodes of "Slings and Arrows". I could feel myself drifting off, which annoys me, as I really don't want to miss any of it, but night time is finding me more tired than is ideal during these busy times. I got my second wind though and stayed up until past midnight working on photos and answering a couple of emails. How I wish I could stay up all night, one night, and still feel fresh as a daisy in the morning! </p>
<p>P.S. Later in the evening Bryn IMd to tell me that Mirei had thrown up at the table after eating a couple of apple slices. Poor wee boo. She's not used to being sick, but the local pharmacist told Bryn there is a bug going around that takes two days to leave the system. She has until tomorrow night to lose this one, if it's the same bad bug. </p>
