								<h2>It's Too Cold to be San Francisco!</h2>
								<p>Riku woke this morning with his second rant of the week, telling me as soon as he opened his eyes at 7 o'clock that he was <strong>NOT</strong> going to school today, that he didn't like his teacher (whom he likes <strong>SO</strong> much!, that he didn't like some of the children, that he didn't like having only two weekend days, and going to school on one of them, and five days at school, with homework, too much homework, etc. etc. Oh, and he was sick too, and coughed and had to blow his nose, all of which are true. </p>
<p>I just lay beside him, letting him get it all off his chest, listening to him, and murmuring "yes" quietly to him when he asked if I was even listening to him. When he stopped he went off to get a new book to read, and I got dressed and crawled in with him while he ate his morning banana and oranges listening to the poems. Then, all was well.</p>
<p>Bryn later told me he very rarely complains about anything once he has some food in his tummy. Too bad we couldn't hook him up intravenously while he is sleeping. I do think he's growing fast though, as I can see how full his face and body has been getting recently. </p>
<p>When I was a little girl, the house in the mornings was often so cold in the winter months, as the coal furnace had not warmed up our big house yet. Mom would turn on the gas stove, and while the porridge cooked on top of the stove, our clothes would be hung on the open door, warming. With ten children at one point, I'm sure there were layers of clothes all vying to get warm, but finally each of us would have at least one, if not two pieces of warm clothing to put on. I will remember all of my days how good that felt, pulling them on as fast as I could so as not to lose any of the warmth. It is so much easier for me to do this for Riku, and he loves it as much as I did. I warm it all up in just a few minutes... socks, underwear, an undershirt, his long sleeved white shirt, and his navy cotton pants. I hope this is a memory he will hold on too, as I did. </p>
<p>We had a very easy morning, as there was time for Riku to draw two pictures today... both involving weapons, fire, and enemies as well as "good guys". He likes me to sit with him and help him eat  which I am happy to do. I often did it for his dad too, when he was that age, as like Riku, Bryn was not a patient eater, and had a hard time just sitting chewing and swallowing! Eventually they do it themselves, so I am fine with doing it while I can! He ate a full bowl of porridge, toast with "bacon" and orange juice. He brushed his teeth, and got himself bundled up in his bright orange Roots sweatshirt plus his navy blue duffle coat that makes him look so British. He's not crazy about it, as I think no one else wears anything like this at school but he is so handsome in it, and I must get a photo of him wearing it. </p>
<p>Riku is such a noticer! Despite being able to see our breath in the air, Riku pointed out how beautiful the tiny yellow daisies were out front of a house on our walk, and then there was his "favourite" tree, a lovely rounded laurel bushy tree, quite small, and with shiny green leaves in two different shades. He often comments on it, and tells me something new about it that he likes. Today he pointed out the purple flowers growing against an ugly wall, so that it wasn't ugly anymore. I guess it is his artistic eye that draws him to these colours. </p>
<p>I packed up the box for Toronto today! Yahoo! I had hoped to have it out last week, but it didn't happen, and I had to snaffle one of the Christmas decoration boxes to mail it in. This took quite a while, but after Doug had lunch, we dashed out to mail it... it should be there in five to seven business days, which means it should be there before the 25th, with any luck at all. We found replacement light bulbs for our tree, and got home in time to walk up to get Riku after school. </p>
<p>I was worried about Riku's fish, and stopped in at a pet store when we were out to ask why they are both just parked on the bottom of the bowl. I was told there may be too much ammonia in their small plastic tank, due to their high output of urine!, so I told Riku about it, just to be on the safe side in case the worst happens. We talked about pets dying and the responsibility of owning pets; Riku thought if the fish did die, I should just buy a dog, because he loves dogs, and Auntie Susan would take care of it, if I wanted to go on a trip. He has answers! </p>
<p>I was to babysit for Bryn and Akane tonight, as they had plans to go out for dinner, but Akane was not feeling well when I dropped Riku off at 3, and said she would likely be staying home. Mirei was in a very feisty mood, blocking Riku from watching TV when he settled in on the sofa. She wanted to put his paper crown on from school, but didn't want him to adjust it on her head, so even though I took several photos, I only managed to get one shot of this fast moving girl today! Meanwhile, Akane and I decided it made sense for Riku to come over tonight to sleep again, leaving Bryn to go out with Sean and friends, and Akane to get to bed early. He had dinner at home and then Bryn dropped him off at 6:30, after Riku had some time with Sean. </p>
<p>I had Christmas music playing when Riku walked in ( I had been talking with Tay as well just before Riku arrived), and he was once again delighted to see the beautiful tree lit up, and to hear so many songs he has been learning. I had put more balls on earlier so it meant we could finally put on the icicles. Riku is a very patient boy, paying attention to what I told him about the need to hang just one on at a time, and to hang it so it hangs straight down. I was amazed at how seriously he took it all in. The tree is very close to being done, but needs more icicles tomorrow. </p>
<p>Caillie called at 7 P.M. here, 10 her time, to say goodnight, a lovely habit which I am enjoying so much. And Riku got to say goodnight to her too! ... especially nice for them both. </p>
<p>There was just time for Riku to do the one more drawing he had in his mind before it was tuck in time, a little later than I would have hoped. However, he was very cooperative, brushed his teeth, got his pjs on in record time, and listened to the Chipmunks song twice before heading in for the last three Shel Silverstein poems in our current book. He was sound asleep at 7:55. </p>
<p>Doug and I changed most of the water from Twinnie and Winnie's tank, refreshing it twice, hoping to bring a little life to this tank. It seemed to be working, as for the first time since they arrived we saw them swimming about. Fingers crossed as I think Riku might be very upset if they don't make it. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched "Gray's Anatomy" and thank goodness it was on tape, as I fell sound asleep about half way through it! It is bedtime for me now, to avoid falling asleep in the movie tomorrow afternoon. Doug has free tickets for it, and it's a Brad Pitt movie, so I must stay awake! </p>
