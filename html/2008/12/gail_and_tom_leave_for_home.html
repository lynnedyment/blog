								<h2>Gail and Tom Leave for Home</h2>
								<p>The alarm was set for 6:30 this morning, to give us a little time together before taking Gail and Tom to the airport for their 11 A.M. flight. As is often true, I woke up fifteen minutes before the alarm sounded, a reaction I think to my strong dislike of being wakened in such a way. I showered quickly, dressed, and checked my email, before Gail came out also dressed and ready for her tea. She too had wakened around 6 o'clock, and so we had time for two games of cards and time to just chat at the table. We left the house at 8:05, and arrived at the airport before 8:30. Gail was happy to have the one big bag off her legs once we arrived; all four of the big bags wouldn't fit in the trunk of our compact car. We walked to their check in point with them, and after a photo, said our sad goodbyes. I know I won't be nearly as productive without my sister here; we have decided that each of the sisters should go once a year to each other's homes, all at the same time, and help each other sort and purge! Wouldn't that be fun! </p>
<p>I had started the laundry before leaving the house, and got that all finished up today, which included the duvet covers and bedding from the guest bedroom. I wrapped some gifts, and realized how little shopping I have done in preparation for Christmas. I know I have to get going at this, as there are cards to write, a tree to decorate, and more clearing to be done before Bryn and his family move in next week. Oy vay! </p>
<p>I called Bryant today to remind him to use his Kiva gift certificate from last Christmas, as Doug had managed to find the code numbers on his computers. Kelly had misplaced them, but I found out had just found them and so it is finally going to happen. Bryn used his in January, but the other three children were not able to lend any money, as all the would be borrowers had been funded, but there are lots of new ones ready to be helped out now. I also talked to Caillie later and Doug walked her through the site so that she could do hers as well. I look forward to hearing who everyone chooses. </p>
<p>I look forward to my walk to the school for Riku each day, as by 2:30 I am ready for some fresh air and a change of pace. I packed him up a yogurt, some grapes, an orange, and a half slice of "Grandpa's" toast, and headed up those 132 steps. It's chilly out there today. Brrrr! Even as I write this tonight, I can feel the cold in the house, although I know I am tired as well, from a too short night last night. I'm planning on heading upstairs early tonight with a warm "bed buddy" or maybe two tonight, since Gail won't be here using the other. </p>
<p>Riku came running up to me in the courtyard, with a big hug and hand holding all the way home. How I am going to miss this when they move to Japan. It's not worth thinking about right now. I love all the stories he tells, and how he is more aware of when I am telling him a little "story". When I gave him the warm toast, I told him that Grandpa had said he thought he smelled something like cinnamon and apple toast, to which I claim to have said "Oh no, not at all. I think you are smelling the Christmas tree." Riku looked up at me and said with a little smile "You didn't really say that did you Nana?" and I had to confess that the whole story was a fabrication, but at least he "gets it" that it is just to amuse him. </p>
<p>We decided I would walk him right home today, although through the hospital grounds, as it was chilly and he had to use the bathroom. So off we went, and in just minutes he was sitting at the table, playing with two or three of his creatures, while eating the snack I had prepared. Mirei had asked when I went in "Are you going to stay to play with me Nana?" and I told her I was going to take her to my house instead. She was a happy little girl going off down the street with me, and I was surprised when she stopped halfway down the block, and asked "Where is he?" I had no idea who she meant and asked her to repeat what she was saying twice, as all I could see were some bags lying on the sidewalk. Then she said "Where is the man who was sleeping here?" and I realized she meant the homeless man (or perhaps a man sleeping off a hangover?) last week. I told her that maybe he had gone home, or maybe he was visiting someone, and that seemed to satisfy her. </p>
<p>Mirei walked all the way home, chatting and taking notice of lots of things... birds on the wire "Which one is your favourite? I like the big one! Do you like the big one too?", and stopping, as her brother did, at the hospital parking signs to point out and name the letters. Mirei smiles at everyone and says hello in a big voice, with lots of smiles coming her way in return. She looks adorable in her big puffy pink print coat! </p>
<p>Mirei often knows exactly what she wants to do when she walks in the front door, and today she told me she was going to wash some dishes and some fruit too. So, she immediately pulled out those items from the little kitchen area, and then proceeded to start to drag one of the kitchen chairs to the sink. I got out her plastic apron, and then left her to her busy work, happy as a clam. She had some "custard please!", and we snuggled up and read two Christmas books.... the "Wee Christmas Mouse" and "Baby's First Christmas" which seem to be her favourites right now. </p>
<p>I took a peek at her in the living room after showing her the beautiful pink sky, and noticed that she was using the little reading lamp as a microphone, singing away into it, and holding on to it too. Of course I ran for the camera to get this on tape, but she never quite got back to the same position with it. She was singing away in Japanese and it was such fun to see. I shall put a link to the YouTube site here when I get that organized. I had her sing a little bit in English too. </p>
<p>Doug dropped Mirei off at home just as her Daddy walked around the corner and gave her a big hug when he spotted her. She had told me earlier she didn't want to go home, but I told her that her daddy would miss her so much and ask "Where is my Mirei? Where is my little girl?" which made her smile and convinced her to leave after all. I'm sure she was delighted to have him right there when she pulled into the driveway. </p>
<p>Doug went to his T'ai Chi class, not typical on a Monday night, but he knows he will be missing classes over the holidays. I took some tea and popcorn upstairs and watched two of my taped Oprah shows, both worth watching. It was a quiet night around here... no cruise videos to watch, no extra work done in the house, and no cards and tea with my sister. However, she did call to say they had just landed in at 7:30 or so, and were happy to be there after a long busy day. </p>
<p>We're off to bed at 10:30. Tomorrow I hope to get lights up on the tree; I can't wait to see that big tree aglow! </p>
