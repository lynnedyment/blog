								<h2>The San Francisco Christmas Season Officially Begins!</h2>
								<p>Gail and Tom went off sightseeing today, to Ghirardelli Square, Fisherman's Wharf, and Pier 39. They left at 11 A.M. and as soon as I waved goodbye to them, I went into high gear and started moving chickens out of the living room, and removing all but books from the bookshelves in the dining room. It was a big job but it was very satisfying to see uncluttered shelves and be able to dust so easily.</p>
<p>After lunch, Doug put up the Christmas lights in the living room. Together we moved the children's bookcase into the hallway, and I washed the floor under the windows and the windows while he was installing the lights. Those lights are just what I need to get me in the Christmas spirit and Doug had Christmas music playing too. Once that was all done, I sat down for a late lunch, and a hot cup of tea with it. I actually sat long enough that I read through a magazine, something I have not done for a while at a meal. </p>
<p>At 2:30, I left to pick up Riku at school, and gave him the option of walking right home, or coming back here for a snack. He chose a quick visit here first, and so was able to see the Christmas lights. He was very excited to spot Grandpa's jellybean jar, empty for many months now, filled with Christmas jelly bellies, in some of his favourite flavours... vanilla, coconut, cherry, apple, and candy cane. I had put up some of the decals on the windows in the kitchen and the rest of the main floor, and Riku made me promise not to do any more decorating without him. He had his snack, with a bowl of pomegranate too, which we both love so much, and managed to get most of a picture drawn as well, before it was time to leave. </p>
<p>Mirei was partway down the stairs when we arrived, and asked me so sweetly "Would you like to come and play with me?" but I had to decline, as we were going to be over just two hours later, and I wanted to continue with the work here. Time is running short, and soon they will all be living with us, with lots of playtime. </p>
<p>I managed to get a few emails written, took some of the chickens and knickknacks upstairs for temporary storage... we have a little spot under the eaves where we can stash things, and when Gail and Tom arrived home at 5:10, Gail and I sat for a fast cup of tea and game of cards. By then it was time to walk over to Hampshire Street. Akane had an art exhibit she wanted to attend, and Bryn was going to drive her there and then pick her up. However, as it turned out, he just stayed on with her instead. </p>
<p>Tom stayed home and Doug went to his T'ai Chi class. Riku and Mirei both drew pictures for Gail while Mirei finished off a bit of her dinner, Riku wanted me in his room with him alone, telling Gail "to "focus on Mirei" in the living room. He wanted me to himself, to show me his newest Lego and made that perfectly clear! He also read an entire Frog and Toad story to me, with lots of his usual expression, making it obvious to me where the exclamation points are. It's such fun to see him doing so well. Bryn told me that he had shown Riku how it was possible to read out loud a little bit faster, and even though he wasn't telling him this to get him to read faster, it was obvious to me that he was doing so. I think this will make reading more appealing to him, as once he knows he can read more quickly out loud, doing so won't seem quite such a "chore" to him. </p>
<p>Gail and Mirei, meanwhile, were having lots of fun too. They read, Mirei "fed" Gail, Gail pretended she was sleeping, and Mirei would wake her up, so Gail and I both enjoyed our quiet times with the children. We sat together at the table for dessert and they did a bit more drawing, and then it was tuck-in time for Riku. I read a story to Riku, of course, at bedtime, and then snuggled up for a cuddle while he relaxed and drifted off. Just as I moved to leave him, he rolled over, told me in a very sleepy voice that he wanted to wave goodbye to me, and drifted back to sleep when I told him I was not leaving the house, but just his room. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane were home when I emerged, and even though we had planned to play cards with them, it turned out that they don't have any! Mirei was a very sleepy girl; Akane got her ready for bed, after Mirei ran around showing us her belly for a few minutes, and so off we went, saying goodnight to our little girl. Bryn dropped us off, and then we got started at some more housework.</p>
<p>I started taking wooden animals and the knickknacks upstairs, Gail moved lots more as well,  and then we all moved the pile of books from the bedroom up to the top shelves of the bookcases. Some of the larger animals from Mexico do not interest us enough to keep them around, so we sorted through those, dusted them, and Doug ended up helping us with the tough cleaning jobs at the top of the hutch, as well as dusting the tops of the walls and ceilings. This was a chore that really needed doing and it felt so good to have some help with it all! </p>
<p>Two games of cards and a late cup of tea ended our very busy day and we all headed off to bed a little earlier than usual, although somehow it was midnight before I turned my light off! </p>
