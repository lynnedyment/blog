								<h2>A Day Out... Petaluma, and Santa Rosa with Charlie Brown!</h2>
								<p>After sitting down last night to decide how to spend Gail and Tom's last three days with us, we realized we had time to go to the Charles Shulz museum in Santa Rosa this trip after all, as well as a side trip first to Petaluma, for stickers!</p>
<p> Gail was especially delighted, as she was ready to stock up on them, and I am always happy to stop by Mrs. Grossman'stoo. Before setting off, though, Gail and I walked over to the hospital so that I could get my free flu shot, needed before the beginning of the year, in order to continue volunteering as a doula. The bonus was that I got to show Gail the labour and delivery floor where I work, so that she can picture it easily in her mind when I write to tell her I'm off to a birth. </p>
<p>We left the house at 9:45, hoping to make it to Mrs. Grossman's in time for her 11 A.M. tour; and we did it with minutes to spare, thank goodness. We enjoyed the free tour, got some free stickers, and then spent a long time browsing through the store, picking out our favourites to bring home. I like lots of different lettering styles, but found some fun new ones as well. Gail found lots of new birthday stickers which she was after, so we both left happy. </p>
<p>We were all ready for lunch by that time, and tried a new spot Doug found on the Internet, a cafe that makes their own sourdough bread fresh each day. The sandwiches were huge, and delicious, and fueled us all for our next excursion, a trip to the Charles Schulz museum, which I had read about a few months ago and was interested in seeing. Luckily, everyone else did too, and we were very happy to spend a couple of hours reading lots of Peanuts cartoons, as well as hearing and learning lots about the wonderful man who created such a grand set of characters. We stopped in at the "Warm Puppy" cafe, just across the street from the museum, part of the indoor ice rink that Charles and his wife founded many years ago for the community in which they lived. Gail and I sat close to the fire, just a table away from Charles Schulz' favourite and reserved table... still with the reserved sign on it, and enjoyed our hot cups of tea. </p>
<p>Doug had also read about an independent cheese maker, so we wandered around for a while trying to find it. Finally we did so, wandered up a long farm drive, and were met by the unsmiling woman we expected from the site but also the generous samples that were promised as well. We bought a nice two-pound wedge and look forward to making a nice big macaroni and cheese casserole soon. </p>
<p>Tom and Doug are trying to fit as many burritos into this trip as can be managed, so Doug suggested "Lucinda's", a take-out spot Bryn found a few years ago north of Mill Bay, near Tiburon. Gail and I had decided earlier not to eat dinner, then changed our minds and decided we would share a burrito. While standing in line to order, we also thought a shared quesadilla sounded like a nice appetizer to eat in the car. Yum! </p>
<p>Once at home, we sat to eat, had a pot of tea, and of course Gail and I played our usual card game, before starting back in at work. Gail and I plan to go downtown tomorrow. Tom and Doug are off on an adventure that doesn't interest us, so we're going to wander around the city, and have lunch at my very favourite restaurant, the "Zuni Cafe".  And since Gail and Tom are treating us all to pizza tomorrow night, here at home, the dining room table had to be cleared off completely, once and for all. There may not be time for any extras at the end of a day out.  It was a big job but finally, by the end of the night, all was tidy and all went to various places... upstairs, in drawers, and out for Goodwill. </p>
<p> How wonderful to have help doing this! Gail has made it possible for me to be so much further ahead in not only Christmas preparations, but in preparing to have Bryn and his family move in with us for two plus months. I hate to think of her leaving in just three days, but I am grateful to have had her with me for two full weeks! </p>
