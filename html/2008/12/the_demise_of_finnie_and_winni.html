								<h2>The Demise of Twinnie and Winnie, and an Afternoon at the Movies!</h2>
								<p>Riku woke up at exactly 7 A.M. today, and I awoke at the same time. The house was really cold, much more so than usual, as the temps have been dropping all week. We had about a high of 11C today and a low of 4C, so we snuggled under the covers after getting a book to read and I got Riku's fruit plate ready. For the first time in ages, Riku also hid under the covers so that Grandpa could find us. I must admit, it was tempting to just stay under them! </p>
<p>However, we read our books, and Riku started thinking about what he was going to draw when he got up. That little mind never stops! He told me it was going to be a fantasy picture, and it was a colorful game of shooting and forts. </p>
<p>Before he started in on it, I warmed his clothes in the dryer (and today even warmed my own(!), and he was happy to step into his warm socks at the end. Me too! </p>
<p>I got dressed and when I came into the kitchen Doug and Riku were standing over the goldfish bowl, with one fish dead on the bottom and the other not looking too healthy at all. Within ten minutes both fish were quiet on the bottom, and Riku dealt with it all so much better than I thought he would. He told us it was no one's fault, and that he thought we should get a dog now! Right... that would make that little boy very happy I know, but it would mean I wouldn't be travelling much to see him or anyone else either. No thank you! </p>
<p>On the way to school today, Riku decided to comment on everything he could see and use references to the five senses, or any adjective that might fit the situation. So, here's a running commentary... "My eyes see the leaves trying to stay on the tree, my nose smells the air and the flowers on the wall, my feet feel the sidewalk, and the crunch when I step on a berry, the cars are resting and happy they don't have to climb the big hills yet, the ants are searching for food, the birds are singing and hanging on to the wires, the man is going to work, my hand is holding your hand and we like holding hands, etc. etc." </p>
<p>I was expecting Finn today, but his usual Thursday morning babysitting is attending the school concert tomorrow for her grandchildren, and so is having Finn today instead. I know he's going to just love seeing the tree all lit up, but it will now have to wait until next week. </p>
<p>I made great headway with the wrapping today and am close to being finished with that job. I also spent an hour putting more ornaments on this big lush tree of ours, and getting yet more icicles on it; it will hold lots more, but this was a good start. Doug packed up the packing boxes for the ornaments and got those stored downstairs, so now the dining room looks tidy for the first time since last weekend. Slowly but surely it's all coming together. </p>
<p>Doug had won free passes to an afternoon sneak preview for today, the Brad Pitt movie to be released on Christmas day. This meant no walk home with Riku today, instead picking him up in the car, and dropping him off with his mom and sister. I did sit in the back seat with him while he started eating his snack, the first of which was apple slices with cinnamon, a treat we haven't had in a while. He was carrying two pieces of art work, one yet to be finished, and gave them both to me. One, a leaf, is drawn with a special crayon, but I have forgotten what it is called. </p>
<p>Doug and I dashed to the theatre on Van Ness, as we have to line up to get decent seats, well ahead of the start time. Turns out the afternoon showings aren't as crowded, so we had an hour of sitting on the floor (me), with Doug leaning against the wall, before we were allowed into the theatre. I was cold sitting, and went off outside to buy a big hot cup of milky tea. Perfect! The movie was "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button", based on a short story be F. Scott Fitzgerald. It was two and a half hours long, but didn't feel like it at all... a quirky story very well acted, and the time passed quickly. </p>
<p>I phoned Riku to say goodnight, and he told me he had left a mean message on my answering machine, because  "I was angry that you weren't home and I wanted to talk to you." That will teach me to go out!  :) </p>
<p>We were hungry but stopped at Costco, to avoid a trip tomorrow, and arrived home too late for a regular dinner. I scrambled some eggs and "sausage" for Doug, had some cheese, with fresh pineapple and coconut ice cream for my own dinner!, and did a little emailing before heading for bed earlier than usual, at 10:30. </p>
