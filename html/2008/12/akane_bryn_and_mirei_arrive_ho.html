								<h2>Akane, Bryn, and Mirei Arrive Home</h2>
								<p>Riku was a very excited boy this morning. The first words out of his mouth were "Nana, I love you. Today Mommy, and Daddy, and Mirei are coming home!" We read four short Shel Silverstein poems and then he was up and ready to draw a picture at the table. I put his fruit plate in front of him, and went up to shower, and Gail sat with him while he ate his breakfast and I made his lunch. </p>
<p>It's the first of December, and I gave Riku his Advent calendar. He was very happy to see a small piece of chocolate behind the first door, shaped like a Christmas tree. We walked up to school at the usual time, and took a few minutes to realize that today is the day the children gather in the schoolyard for Monday morning assembly. I waved goodbye after walking him to his room, and came home to have an egg and sourdough toast breakfast with Gail and Tom, get the laundry going, Riku's bed stripped, etc. etc. </p>
<p>Gail and I also played a few games of morning cards, something we have not done since she arrived and then Gail vacuumed this entire floor thoroughly, making it look so much better! There are bags in the hallway downstairs waiting to be distributed to various places; how I love seeing things moving out of this house. </p>
<p>Glenn called on Skype as well, and sounds just awful, as he has a terrible cough and most likely has picked up a bug that is going 'round the Falls.  </p>
<p>The doorbell rang about noon hour, and there was Bryn with a little girl, peering in my front window. I got a huge hug and big smiles from her, and then she was dashing up the stairs to see Auntie Gail and Uncle Tom. Grandpa had picked her up at the airport and got his big hugs there. Mirei immediately got busy with the little kitchen, making us "tea" and "breakfast", and then settled in at the table to play with her pretend birthday cake, serving us large slices while we all sang the birthday song a half dozen times. She ate a nice big real lunch and then she too took much delight in finding a chocolate behind the door in her Advent calendar. </p>
<p>Gail, Mirei, and I walked up to the school to meet Riku, and what big smiles and big hugs she got from her brother. His little face just lit up when he saw her and he held hands with her all the way home, telling her about the movie he saw, and pointing out BM on the sidewalk, and chatting up a storm, stopping now and then to cup her face in his hands, or just look at her. It was just adorable. </p>
<p>Back here the two of them cuddled up in the bedding on the floor of the small bedroom, looked through books together, smiled and read to each other, played out in the garden, and went upstairs with some of the stuffed animals. They both had snacks, which included a tiny chocolate bar for Riku from his Hallowe'en stash. As soon as he finished it though, he started grabbing at his throat and making loud clearing sounds, asking me for something to eat because his throat was bothering him. Now we really do think he has an allergy to peanuts as that was listed as an ingredient on the wrapper. I instantly gave him an antihistamine, and let Bryn know what had happened. We will get him to a skin specialist asap to see what is going on, as he has had quite a fine rash on his legs and torso over the past few days, so there may be other food allergies as well. I'm sure he will be getting tested soon, so we know what to he needs to avoid. </p>
<p>We all walked to Hampshire Street at 4:30, although the tablet by that time had made Riku dozy and a little edgy, so he wasn't thrilled about walking home, something he never objects to. However, Doug and Tom were at the Hiller Aeronautical Museum with the car, so we had no choice. We met Akane almost at the corner of Potrero Avenue, and all walked to the house together. She got a big hug too, and later I spoke to him on the phone and found out he had a very successful piano lesson, and was very happy with his new toy, a wheel that turns into a robot!</p>
<p>Tom and Doug were home shortly after we walked in the door, so we had a quick dinner and then dashed off to Costco. Back at home Gail and I had tea, a few games of cards, and then Bryn walked in with a visit and some gifts for us... tea and food goodies for Gail and me, chocolates and biscuits for Doug and some canned beer for Tom. We heard a little bit about their trip including the story of Mirei dashing out to play at recess with the children at what will be her new French immersion daycare in Kyoto. </p>
<p>We had planned to get some extra work done in the house, but both Gail and I were too tired to do much. I started collecting up all the chickens and knickknacks from the living room and the front bedroom, in anticipation of Bryn and family moving in, and Christmas decorating, coming soon! We had a last game of cards and went off to bed.</p>
