								<h2>Good Morning, Riku, Good Night Riku, and Bryn and Caillie in Between!</h2>
								<p>Riku woke this morning at 6:45, told me quietly about his dreams of a castle, getting locked in, with lots of bad people, but one good one, who helped him get out. He dreamed all night long, as he talked in his sleep at least three times. He asked me to tell him my dream but I couldn't remember it. Usually I do and enjoy sharing this exchange each morning we are together. </p>
<p>Usually we have a big stack of books beside the bed, and read as many of them as we can before getting up, but today Riku wanted to go over the photos in the little album Kelly made me for Mother's Day last year. Skippy was in Riku's arms, and Riku was explaining who everyone was in the pictures. He now has it very clear in his mind about parents, and grandparents, and siblings, and cousins, and Skippy was told all about them. </p>
<p>We heard Grandpa stirring about, so of course did what we always do ... hid! Then Doug walked in, a he always does, pretending to wonder where we are. Riku used to giggle and wiggle while all this was going on, but now he lies ever so quietly, not making a peep, but fully anticipating what is to come.  Doug wanders around from room to room, questioning out loud just where we might be, until finally he lifts the covers quickly, or pulls them down, causing Riku to break into laughter each and every time. I wonder how long this little ritual will last.</p>
<p>Riku started making a card for Gail last night, so he finished it off this morning by adding some presents and some glittery decorations to the tree. This morning I remembered to take a photo of Riku holding the shell he bought the day we went to Pier 39, and shall add it to that album today, and to this blog for the "photo of the day."  :) </p>
<p>Oh, I got another book mark, hastily but lovingly made by, and presented to me, from Riku. I have quite a nice little collection of these now.  </p>
<p>Bryn picked up a happy boy at 8:20 A.M. and we waved goodbye as he set off for his summer "camp" day. </p>
<p>Mid-afternoon Caillie IM'd through from her Oma and Opa's (on Bryn's IM account), to tell me she was sick... headachy and stuffy, and missed me and that everyone else was out fishing except Oma. The children will be here in just fourteen days, so the count down has begun! Caillie started to feel a little dizzy and light-headed, went to lie down, and then Bryn and I chatted for a little bit. Uncle Mark had caught a fish, they were anticipating eating his chocolate birthday cake tonight (Caillie decorated it), and Bryn had called Caroline, the love of his life currently (his IM heading is Bryn (heart) Caroline so there is no secret being exposed here) to wish her a happy birthday. These two have known each other since Jr.K. </p>
<p>Gail and I worked for a couple of hours on our family trees, despite her having a terrible sounding throat from acid caused by her meds for pain. Poor kid; she sounds so ill, but insisted that working away at this took her mind off it. However, she finally had to stop and go to lie down. I sat working away at more hits for far too long. </p>
<p>The phone rang just past 7:30 and it was Riku calling to say goodnight to me. I asked him about school... he did the computer all by himself today! and told me he ate all his lunch... two eggs and "bacon" today!, but saved his snack yogurt for after school. He always eats his fruit though and I think would eat if first if not reminded to eat the protein while I pack it up for him. Jackie picked him up from school today and it must have been a fun time, and a busy day, as Riku told me he was tired, and sounded it too. </p>
<p>He did ask about Skippy though before hanging up, asking how many naps he had today, and wondering if I had fed him. He's obviously quite enjoying his role as the father figure, although I know it drives his dad crazy to hear Skippy "talking" baby talk. Doug said I must remind him of all the conversations he himself had with "monkey", who was well worn and well loved as well. You will see Skippy was included in the photo with the shell this morning; he's never far from sight lately but this too shall pass. </p>
