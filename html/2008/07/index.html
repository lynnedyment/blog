								<h2><a href="/2008/07/riku_morning_1.html">Good Morning, Riku, Good Night Riku, and Bryn and Caillie in Between!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke this morning at 6:45, told me quietly about his dreams of a castle, getting locked in, with lots of bad people, but one good one, who helped him get out. He dreamed all night long, as he talked in his sleep at least three times. He asked me to tell him my dream but I couldn't remember it. Usually I do and enjoy sharing this exchange each morning we are together. </p>
<p>Usually we have a big stack of books beside the bed, and read as many of them as we can before getting up, but today Riku wanted to go over the photos in the little album Kelly made me for Mother's Day last year. Skippy was in Riku's arms, and Riku was explaining who everyone was in the pictures. He now has it very clear in his mind about parents, and grandparents, and siblings, and cousins, and Skippy was told all about them. </p>
<p>We heard Grandpa stirring about, so of course did what we always do ... hid! Then Doug walked in, a he always does, pretending to wonder where we are. Riku used to giggle and wiggle while all this was going on, but now he lies ever so quietly, not making a peep, but fully anticipating what is to come.  Doug wanders around from room to room, questioning out loud just where we might be, until finally he lifts the covers quickly, or pulls them down, causing Riku to break into laughter each and every time. I wonder how long this little ritual will last.</p>
<p>Riku started making a card for Gail last night, so he finished it off this morning by adding some presents and some glittery decorations to the tree. This morning I remembered to take a photo of Riku holding the shell he bought the day we went to Pier 39, and shall add it to that album today, and to this blog for the "photo of the day."  :) </p>
<p>Oh, I got another book mark, hastily but lovingly made by, and presented to me, from Riku. I have quite a nice little collection of these now.  </p>
<p>Bryn picked up a happy boy at 8:20 A.M. and we waved goodbye as he set off for his summer "camp" day. </p>
<p>Mid-afternoon Caillie IM'd through from her Oma and Opa's (on Bryn's IM account), to tell me she was sick... headachy and stuffy, and missed me and that everyone else was out fishing except Oma. The children will be here in just fourteen days, so the count down has begun! Caillie started to feel a little dizzy and light-headed, went to lie down, and then Bryn and I chatted for a little bit. Uncle Mark had caught a fish, they were anticipating eating his chocolate birthday cake tonight (Caillie decorated it), and Bryn had called Caroline, the love of his life currently (his IM heading is Bryn (heart) Caroline so there is no secret being exposed here) to wish her a happy birthday. These two have known each other since Jr.K. </p>
<p>Gail and I worked for a couple of hours on our family trees, despite her having a terrible sounding throat from acid caused by her meds for pain. Poor kid; she sounds so ill, but insisted that working away at this took her mind off it. However, she finally had to stop and go to lie down. I sat working away at more hits for far too long. </p>
<p>The phone rang just past 7:30 and it was Riku calling to say goodnight to me. I asked him about school... he did the computer all by himself today! and told me he ate all his lunch... two eggs and "bacon" today!, but saved his snack yogurt for after school. He always eats his fruit though and I think would eat if first if not reminded to eat the protein while I pack it up for him. Jackie picked him up from school today and it must have been a fun time, and a busy day, as Riku told me he was tired, and sounded it too. </p>
<p>He did ask about Skippy though before hanging up, asking how many naps he had today, and wondering if I had fed him. He's obviously quite enjoying his role as the father figure, although I know it drives his dad crazy to hear Skippy "talking" baby talk. Doug said I must remind him of all the conversations he himself had with "monkey", who was well worn and well loved as well. You will see Skippy was included in the photo with the shell this morning; he's never far from sight lately but this too shall pass. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/07/chez_papa_and_chez_doeringelli_1.html">Chez Papa and Chez Doering/Ellis</a></h2>
								<p>A few weeks back Don emailed, asking if he could pass on our phone number to a local San Francisco gal, a woman he knows through an online music group. They have "known" each other for many years. Naturally, always being happy to meet someone knew, I said "Of course." We met today at "Chez Papa", a restaurant in the newly opened Mint Plaza in downtown San Francisco. Lee brought along a friend who works in the publishing field with her. I assumed there would be lots of music talk, but instead the conversation was varied, as travel, England in general, and Liverpool in particular were also discussed. Lunch was simple and delicious; Roger and I had cream of broccoli soup along with the tasty, crusty dinner rolls, and Doug and Lee both ordered a grilled asparagus salad. Each twosome also shared a cone of pommes frites, and I finished off the meal with tea. </p>
<p>Back home for a couple of hours, which worked out well for both emailing and Doug booking my flight east in the fall. I will be flying into and out of Toronto for the first time in years, so that works well for starting off my visit with Caillie's 11th birthday and ending it after Kelly's. </p>
<p>I also had a phone call from a little girl today. Mirei was on her way home from her nursery school program, and her daddy was trying to keep her awake. I think it worked, as she chatted away with enthusiasm, telling me she had gone to school, that Daddy was taking her home now, that they were passing a pink house, that she played, and goodbye because they were there now! </p>
<p>I missed seeing Amelia and Finn on Saturday; they had gone off to the beach with Susan, Kevin, and Bryn & family, before Amelia's swimming lesson. Today worked out well for a visit to Waller Street. Amelia wanted to bath immediately today, so she could apply a "tattoo", and Finn joined her in the tub for only the second time. He was much more co-operative about sitting down this time, playing with the various toys and trying desperately to do every single thing Amelia did. She was "washing" the walls with the bubbles at first and he just watched and then immediately tried to as well. He's just not tall enough, though, and had to be coaxed into sitting. I heard him laugh out loud for the first time, as Amelia made funny noises with a bubble blower. It really tickled his fancy and it was adorable to hear. </p>
<p>Now there's a boy who is going to be very happy when he can do exactly what he wants. He's really astounding, as today he insisted on walking up the stairs, holding on to the banister! Even though he needs spotting, it's amazing how well he managed! He <strong>is</strong> only 18 months old! If Amelia can do it, then he does his best to do it too. You can see the frustration in his face when it doesn't work out. I'm impressed with his determination! </p>
<p>He was obviously a tired fellow and Susan tried twice to put him down for a nap, so Amelia and I went ahead with our "tea". We had cookies and some chocolate candies too, and of course our milky tea. I love it that Amelia no longer puts sugar in hers, but likes it just like mine. Finn joined us with his mom, determined not to sleep if his mom didn't hold him, and no doubt not wanting to miss out on a thing either. </p>
<p>Amelia's favourite activity with me when I am at her house is to pull out the animals and have them "talk" to each other. I know that drives some adults wild, boring them to tears, but I am just fine with it. Today Amelia wanted to play with her vast collection of bunnies, and I thought to talk about Peter Rabbit, and his "siblings",  Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail. We pretended that Peter went into Mr. McGregor's garden... Amelia handled this part of it, pretending that the big basket where they are stored was the vegetable patch, while I worked with the other more obedient bunnies. I pulled down her set of Beatrix Potter books, which she hadn't read, and we read the very first one. She thoroughly enjoyed it, looking at each beautiful illustration and really paying attention. That gave us enough inspiration for a second round with the animals, as Peter didn't feel well after overindulging and the younger siblings took turns asking how he was. </p>
<p>Finn had refused to nap a second time at this point, so he joined us in the bedroom. He just rolled around in the bunnies, stepping over and around them, and when Amelia asked me to cover her with them, he too joined in and piled them up on her. It was lots of fun and I was sorry I didn't have my own camera with me. I took a few photos with Susan's, but am not very familiar with it. </p>
<p>I was back home at 6 P.M. and Doug told me he had two visitors here while I was gone. Riku had called... (how handy it is that he knows our number now(!) ), and asked if he and Jackie, the male Chinese student who is taking over from Maggie, could come for a visit. Doug is not sure, but they may have been on the bus when he called, but eventually the door bell rang and they played with Skippy in the bedroom and must have kept busy with some other activities too, as Doug just continued working on his computer. Akane called to say they had to get home, and Riku apparently remembered he hadn't had a snack!, something he usually has on the way home from school when we pick him up. Doug put out some fresh pineapple and a juice box, and after sitting in the garden at the new table for that, off they went. I'm sorry I missed them. Doug said there was a discussion about whether or not Skippy should stay here or go home with Riku, but Doug managed to convince him that he would miss all his friends if he left. </p>
<p>Kelly had time for some IM-ing with both Doug and me tonight; we shared some Canadian news stories, and I told her I was booked for my annual fall trip too. And this morning, just as I was dashing to eat a little breakfast Myk' IM-ed to let me know she had been hired to work at the ice cream shop in Mindemoya for the six weeks she is visiting with her grandparents, and Don called to tell me not to share any secrets about him at lunch.  :) </p>
<p>We had a very light dinner with a fruit and veggie plate, and watched a new British sitcom which wasn't much to our taste...  not that we have any shortage of movies/shows to watch! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/07/happy_birthday_doug_1.html">Happy Birthday Doug!</a></h2>
								<p>Today Doug turned 64, and we started the celebration with lunch out, just the two of us. This is a rare event these days, and it was lovely. Doug had given me a gift certificate last year for "Roy's", which sounds like a burger shack to us, but in actual fact is quite a nice high-end Hawaiian-Japanese fusion spot downtown. Doug had been just once before and liked it enough that he wanted me to go too, so this was a gift for both of us. I started off with their delicious miso broth with lots of exotic mushrooms, delicate and perfectly done.  My main dish was a  firm white fish called ono; Doug had mahi-mahi. We had different "sides" and exchanged them, giving Doug my fried bananas and I ate his potato wedges. It was all yummy. </p>
<p>Not too filling though, which was a good thing, but it called out for just a little bit of something extra. Ice cream sounded appealing, and so off we went to "Bi-Rite Creamery" to start off using another gift certificate, this time a gift from Akane and Bryn for Doug last year. Perfect choice, and now that Doug knows where this spot is, I'm sure he will go through the rest of the card in no time. I was very happy with my scoop and a half of toasted coconut ice cream, as was Doug with his salted caramel... sounds strange but is strangely delicious(!), and another of almond cherry. </p>
<p>I was fairly well organized, considering a morning change of plans for this birthday. We had originally decided on a Sunday morning beach picnic celebration, but for various reasons decided to have dinner here tonight instead. The cheesecake went into the oven early, and I had everything prepped by early afternoon for a simple meal of baked pasta dish, green salad, and garlic bread. The afternoon was easy and relaxed. </p>
<p>At 3 P.M. we were there to pick up Riku from summer camp. He came out beaming as usual, carrying a red, white, and blue star mobile made in honour of the 4th of July tomorrow, and a lovely picture he made "just for you, Nana!" I am one lucky woman as later on he also made me another hand-coloured book mark too. He had some quiet time with Skippy, liked the basket with a handle that I had found for Skippy's new bed, and made a beautiful card for his Grandpa too. </p>
<p>Susan had taken the children to the Marin County fair this morning (Kevin had left early for Alaska to celebrate his mom's birthday with her), and they showed up at 4:15 or so, dusty, thirsty, and sweaty from a fun, busy day in the heat. Riku was just delighted to have Amelia here to play with him. They went running into the bedroom and played with Skippy, Kitty-cat, and all the other animal friends. </p>
<p>Finn was equally delighted to see Doug. He hasn't been here the last couple of times that Finn has been over, and Finn always looks at Doug's computer chair with a frown, wondering where in the world he could be. He immediately crawled up onto Doug's lap and was prepared to stick with him as long as he could. He's a guy's guy, that Finn, but Mommy's boy too when he's tired. </p>
<p>Akane, Bryn, and Mirei arrived at 5:15 and the next two hours went by in a blur for me. Dinner, horns blowing, trains going 'round and 'round, four children in the tub!, some quiet drawing time at different times for all four children, with Finn looking mighty pleased with himself sitting at the big kids' table. We ended the evening with cake, candles, and tea. The children packed a lot into those three plus hours, and they were all heading out the door at 7:30, tired, with Amelia in Riku's short striped "Where the Wild Things Are" PJs and Riku in his long striped dino PJs, which are both "house" PJs. Amelia gets a big kick out of wearing Riku's PJs, and really liked his Spiderman set last winter. </p>
<p>Various people had done some tidying up of the dishes and clearing the table too, but it still seemed to take a long time to get it all finished up and put away. It was really just a half hour though, but I was more than ready for some sitting down time, so took a hot cup of tea up to the bedroom, pulled out my book, and promptly fell asleep for one solid hour! The tea was stone cold, it went down the drain, and I headed up for an early night at 10:15. </p>
<p>It was a happy birth day celebration for Doug, with singing birthday wishes via phone from Amelia, Kelly & Gregg, and Bryn & Caillie from Oma's & Opa's house, plus lots of E-cards from family and friends too, as well as the snail mail cards on the mantle. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/07/berries_snap_crackle_and_pop.html">Berries, Snap, Crackle, and Pop!</a></h2>
								<p>Our plan for the 4th of July was to go berry picking with Susan and the children. Bryn dropped the children off about 9:30, and an hour and a half slipped by with a second breakfast for them both... "Grandpa's toast" and hot chocolate for Mirei and porridge for Riku with berries and banana today. </p>
<p>Mirei was feeling her "oats" (read a tired girl), and was bugging her brother whenever she got the chance, trying to run off with Skippy and Kitty-Cat, preferring his animals even when given her own basket with animals and blankets. They did eventually sort it out and made up a little nest of blankets in the bedroom, then played nicely there for a long time while I packed up our snacks. </p>
<p>Ralph, our very friendly neighbour, was outside, and I wished him a happy 4th; Mirei did as well, and then told him we were going berry picking. He was very impressed at how well she spoke, as they have a great granddaughter the same age, and he can't understand her as well as he did all of Mirei's chatting. It's amazing how verbal, friendly, and open this little girl is. Ralph's wife came over to say hello too, and she also got to hear about our plan for the day. </p>
<p>Mirei needed her nap and our hope was that she would fall asleep almost instantly, so she could pick berries as she expected to, but instead Riku nodded off quite quickly, while Mirei pointed out the trees, and the buildings, and the trucks to us! Fifteen minutes before we arrived at Webb Ranch Farm, she finally gave in. We lucked out though, as Riku and I were able to get out of the car quietly, meeting up with Susan and the children, who had arrived at exactly the same time. Doug sat in the car with a sleeping girl for an hour and a quarter, reading, while we gathered blackberries. What fun this was! Amelia and Riku were in their glory, with fingers stained pink and purple, while searching for the big plump berries. Finn was in his glory as well, as he could wander freely down a long corridor of berry bushes and still be easily seen. He tried his hand at picking berries too, but was very cautious when he realized that those branches were prickly. Turns out that things on the ground were just as interesting, and he found lots of sticks and stones. An hour passed very quickly and we decided to try our hand at raspberries next. </p>
<p>Mirei had just wakened, so off we went to the new section. The pickings weren't as good there, and it was much harder to find ripe berries. Mirei, who had turned down a snack fifteen minutes earlier, decided she was hungry so she and I went back to the car, leaving Doug, Susan, and Amelia to continue on, with Finn on Mommy's back. Riku on his own decided to follow Mirei and me, and just as we sat down at a table in a shady spot, Riku came running up to us, very proud he had found us on his own. He liked our cool little spot, and we had a tiny "picnic" of snacks and juice. There were horses just across the road so we went over to check them out. It may have been the first time that Mirei had seen a horse, and she just did not want to leave. "Hi horse. Hi!" over and over again. Riku went off again to explore a little playhouse, Mirei joined him and then Susan, Doug, Amelia, and Finn joined us as well. Three children played inside the tiny building, while Amelia preferred to explore from the roof, making us all a little nervous as it wasn't exactly a sturdy structure! </p>
<p>Everyone by this time was tired and hungry, so we went our separate ways, Susan and the children to Portola Valley for a sleepover with friends, and Doug, Riku, Mirei, and I to a Mexican restaurant for lunch. Mirei was full of energy and enthusiasm and flirted outrageously with a table of two couples, but both children ate quesadillas and french fries, drank lots of water ("pretty blue glass with ice, lots of ice!" said Mirei), and we headed right home, after a busy and fun day out. </p>
<p>Bryn had called to say that they would pick up veggie Chinese food for dinner; he and Akane had a rare day alone today, so went out for dim sum, and then off to do some shopping to get the children's "twin" beds set up for sleeping tonight. Big night, with both children in separate beds, in their own room. Dinner was delicious, everyone was tuckered out, and when they left at 7:30, Doug and I headed upstairs with a wonderful British movie rental, called "Housewife 49", based on a true story in wartime Britain. The bombing segments in the movie fit right in with the booming fireworks outside tonight. Even though there was heavy fog, we still saw lots of starbursts, and the accompanying booms reverberating against the hills of rock behind us. They went on well after midnight, Doug tells me, but I was asleep before that.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/07/saturday_feels_like_sunday_1.html">Saturday... Feels Like Sunday!</a></h2>
								<p>I woke this morning, thinking that Riku had his reading program with Bryn at 9 A.M. but quickly realized it is just Saturday, so two more days in the weekend! Yahoo! Bryn had suggested last night that we go off to the new skateboard park in the neighbourhood first thing this morning, so I got up and showered early, with lots of time for the paper and a leisurely breakfast. They had a nice slow morning at home too, with no plans to rush out to do a thing. </p>
<p>We had problems with our computers last night, so except for one instance, we only got email through once last evening, and none at all overnight. Doug was on the phone to the service provider several times, and in between Kelly and I managed to find some time to talk to each other. The children's plane tickets arrived, Opa is in the hospital, Kelly is finding her summer school courses very interesting but time consuming, and is looking forward to having her summer holidays start close to the end of July. It's rare that we both have time in the mornings at home to chat and catch up, so it was wonderful. </p>
<p>Riku was expecting a four year old visitor at his home at 3 P.M., the daughter of a friend of Akane's from art school here, so I suggested he come over for a morning visit with us, and Mirei have her nap here at noon. She slept for the first time in her own bed last night, in "Riku's" room, so an early nap is called for. When told of the plan, Riku said he would like Mirei to come over with him, so a half hour later the door bell was ringing madly, with a smiling Riku peeking in the glass, and Mirei hard up behind him shouting, yes really truly shouting "Nana! Nana!" as though she hadn't seen me in ages. In fact, when we picked Riku up a few days ago that is exactly what he said "Nana, I haven't seen you in <strong>ages</strong>!"and then asked me what "ages" meant. </p>
<p>The two of them kept so busy that the next two and a half hours really flew by. Mirei had brought over her pink balloon from Doug's party, and so I blew up another for Riku. I "squealed" it for them, let it fly loose a few times, and then tied it up so they could both bat them around until they lost interest. Mirei decided she wanted to go out in the garden, and struggled to buckle the tiny straps on her sandals herself. She has always been very determined to do everything on her own, but much more so, and much more verbal about it too since starting nursery school two weeks ago. We hear "I do it!" a lot, but she did finally allow Riku to help her at last. </p>
<p>We found a great basketball hoop, with a base full of sand, at the corner last night coming back from the berry farm. People often just leave things on the street when they are done with them around here, and it often works in our favour too, both ways. There is even a new-to-us bookcase in the living room now, filled with the overflow of children's books from the bedroom. Anyway, Doug dragged the basketball stand home and Bryn dragged it up the stairs to the back yard, with a little "help" from the children. Riku is loving it, and spent lots of time trying to get his balloon and a ball into it. </p>
<p>As soon as that ended, it was on to watering the plants with many plastic glasses full of water. Mirei then swept up, while Riku rescued a "pill" bug. He wondered what it liked to eat, so Grandpa went on the Internet and found out all about them.. they have gills, fourteen legs, need to have lots of dampness to stay alive... wet paper towels did the trick, and eat rotting vegetation. Riku found some leaves and made a "home" for it in the lid of a plastic container. This took lots of time, and he ended this little science lesson by making a drawing of the bug, after checking it out carefully with a magnifying glass. I just went to check on the newcomer, and apparently it is out visiting, or has moved on. Ah well, there is no shortage of these bugs-with-many-names in our garden. </p>
<p>Mirei has decided that she very much enjoys washing her hands in the bathroom sink, all on her own. Usually she drags the heavy wooden steps over to the sink, but today decided to just pull out the wicker storage basket instead and stand on that! I'm surprised it held her up, but it did. Neither Amelia nor Riku even thought to do this, but Mirei, well trust her to come up with something new.  </p>
<p>Plans for our day changed, as they are wont to do around here. Kai, an old classmate of Riku's from his "Little Angels" nursery school program, was available for a play date at Riku's at noon hour. Even though they live just a few blocks apart, they don't often see each other, so this was a treat. Riku does enjoy having a boy over to play Ultraman with, or just to play in the room, with all the other toys. Doug offered to walk him home via the skateboard park, but Riku wanted to spend the extra hour here. </p>
<p>He has been giving his dad a hard time about talking on his cell phone the past two days. A new law was passed making it illegal to use phones that are hand held; he told me this morning that his dad was breaking the rules, and I encouraged him to keep at him about it! Bryn told me this morning that even though he was on for just one minute with a friend, he felt it was too stressful having a monitor going off in the back seat, so hung up in protest! I must get Mirei in on the act. </p>
<p>As soon as Bryn picked him up at noon hour, Mirei chose a Caillou book for her tuck-in time, suggested a big "family hug" with Doug, said "night night Grandpa!" and off we went. To "settle" herself today, she played "this little piggie went to market" on her own toes, followed by "itsy bitsy spider", kissed me three times on the cheek, pulled my hair over to one side of my head... it's not a pretty picture when I leave her room!, and after ten minutes was fast asleep. I nodded off to for fifteen minutes, and Mirei slept on for another two hours and fifteen minutes! We were snuggled up reading on the sofa when Bryn walked in to take her home; he and Doug had been off to the hardware store, so the timing was perfect. We had another family hug with Bryn too this time, and off they went at 3 P.M. There were lots of people at her house, and I bet she had a grand ol' time socializing! </p>
<p>Doug and I sat down to some serious photo work! We accomplished so much, which really means Doug did lots of work, while I encouraged him. I did sort through lots of photos though, deleting with some reluctance the ones I felt I could live without. I annotated and put up Doug's birthday album tonight, added blog photos, a fairly recent accomplishment, with much thanks to Bryn and Doug, and felt so good about it all. </p>
<p>Fresh corn on the cob for dinner tonight! Yum! I bought eight cobs from Webb Farm yesterday, and I think it has been the best corn I have had in years in California. Tasted just like Ontario corn. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched part two of a British detective series we started the other night, and enjoyed it just as much. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/07/the_loveliest_of_afternoons_an.html">The Loveliest of Afternoons.. and Eight Days to Go!</a></h2>
								<p>Doug and I had a quiet day at home working on photos, emails, and for me the usual Monday chores. I also talked to both Bryn and Caillie on IM for quite a long time, about how quickly their trip is coming up and where they are going to sleep next week. Bryn would like his own room this year, and Caillie decided she would sleep in the middle room where the children sleep. I love having this way of keeping in touch with them, as often phone calls are not possible for us. It's quick and easy to find out if someone is online though. Lucky me, living in this time period. How my mom and dad would have loved such easy access to their grandchildren, too many miles away! </p>
<p>Of course, Monday also means it's Riku's sleepover day, something that we all really look forward to. We picked him up from school/camp at 3:05, and he was barely in his car seat before he started telling us all about his day. He learned some more Kung Fu, played in the playground, and saw big boys showing their nipples! For a good portion of the way home, this was <strong>the</strong> topic. We told him that in the olden days women's ankles were what people were giggling about, and tried to downplay it all by talking about elbows and noses being pretty funny too, but that made no impact at all. Nipples and penises are in the conversation a lot these days, for whatever reason. This seems to be true among a few of my friends' grandchildren too, and the comments range from "penises are interesting but nipples are <strong>very</strong> interesting" to "I have nipples but my mommy's nipples are <strong>very</strong> big!", both comments from boys.  </p>
<p>Once at home, we gave Riku one of the "house" gifts we bought yesterday, a bug collecting jar. We couldn't have found a better one, as from the moment he opened it, with a sincere and big "thank you!", Riku was a busy boy. He was thrilled with the magnified lid, the separate magnifying glass, and the tongs to pick up the specimens with. He found two pill bugs, and as he put them in the jar he told me that one of them was having babies. I looked and only saw something that looked as though it was being dragged, but Riku was very excited about it, as he went about collecting grass and dirt and wetting a paper towel for them. He was bent over the jar, checking it all out and had me go over to look too. Much to my surprise there were brand new baby pill bugs running here and there, white, ghostly, barely visible teeny creatures, so tiny that Doug missed them the first time he looked. What a good parent Riku is, checking them all out every few minutes to make sure all was well. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, he was curious about what ants ate, so up on Doug's lap he went, while Doug found some good sites explaining all about them. After his tub, he asked if he could see what scrotums looked like, and of course Grandpa once more found the right place to look. There were outside pictures, and inside pictures, with tubes and vessels, etc. until Riku decided it wasn't worth more time looking. </p>
<p>Dinner time followed, in two courses. First came fresh corn on the cob from Webb Ranch Farm from our Friday excursion. Three-day-old corn shouldn't have tasted as good as it did, but it was the best corn we have had in ages, and we divided up four cobs. Riku couldn't manage eating it off the cob with his two bottom teeth missing but ate every kernel with a spoon. He was pretty full after that (he had eaten a banana too, just before his tub), so we waited forty-five minutes before sitting down again for a small bowl of pasta, a tiny bit of custard with his blackberries from Friday, and finishing off with a very small bowl of coconut/pineapple ice cream which he liked <strong>so</strong> much! </p>
<p>Riku was ready for bed at 7 P.M., talked to his daddy for a few minutes, and then we had time for two long stories before tuck in. However, the sweetest thing happened first; he took Skippy, whom he usually sleeps with here, and told him very quietly and gently that tonight he was going to sleep all by himself, told him he was growing up and he would be just fine, and tucked him into his basket beside the bed. Riku has been reading each night before bed with Bryn, but tonight just wanted to be read to. He did read two sentences, though, and then settled down to be read to. I walked out the door at 7:40, leaving behind a sleeping boy and an independent Skippy too. </p>
<p>Lots of emails came in today, so I kept busy answering as many of them as I could before heading for bed myself at 11 P.M. with a slightly sore throat and quite sore ears. I gargled with salt water and used the Neti pot many times today hoping to head this off. It usually works, so fingers crossed. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/07/water_guns_and_clearing_out.html">Water Guns, and Clearing Out!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke at exactly 6:45 this morning, eleven hours after he fell asleep. He stretched and turned to me with a smile when he saw I too was awake. I read a couple of stories to him, and got up to make his fruit bowl. When I went back in, there he was, sitting in bed, reading one of Mirei's sound books to Skippy. Sweet sight.  I then snuggled back in to look over the first chapter in a book about family rituals. Kelly had given it to me for my 47th birthday and it's lovely. Riku had lots of questions about dipping babies into water at baptisms, circumcision ("<strong>that</strong> is not very nice!"), raising babies to the sky, another form of "baptism" among a Native Indian group, water poured over babies foreheads, and another where a man jumps over a platform where several newborns lie. The next chapter is about rituals with slightly older children, more Riku's age, so that will be very interesting. Nice to learn so early that the world is filled with varied and different traditions. </p>
<p>We only had fifty minutes until Bryn would be picking him up, but the morning went very smoothly; he had eaten, dressed, washed, had his teeth and hair brushed, and even sun-blocked, by 8 A.M., leaving him twenty minutes of fun time. He discovered the four water guns we bought as house presents on Sunday, knowing his cousins would love to take part in that activity. It was pretty cute to see Riku with all four stuffed into his pockets, and a couple of them leaking water too. He tidied the little desk, checked out his latest drawing, and told Skippy he was very proud of him for sleeping all night on his own. A happy boy left for school at 8:20. </p>
<p>Bryn and Caillie arrive in just one week(!), and there is much to do before that day comes. I got busy and had a very successful day, planting new flowers at the front entrance, washing down the steps after a thorough brushing, washing the windows on the front door, and vacuuming up the stairs. I put up an old printer on FreeCycle and it's gone! Doug helped by photographing an old table to list, and sell, we hope, on Craigslist. We don't use it, it's big and clumsy, and I won't want to move it when we leave here, and it's time we just dealt with it.</p>
<p>I had a delicious lunch, made by Soo for me, and delivered by Bryn this morning. I feel truly spoiled by this kind woman who cooks for me! I had phoned last week to tell her how much I had enjoyed a particular dish, especially on two very hot days, and she prepared it again for me. It is chock full of nutritious healthy foods... slivered braised tofu, sprouts, celery, red and yellow peppers, cellophane noodles, all tossed together in a very tasty seasoned marinade. She had suggested I add a little vinegar to it, and it just hit the spot, after all the hot work I did this morning. Lucky me! </p>
<p>And so the day went, with lots of little jobs getting taken care of, as well as plenty of IM-ing with Caillie, on and off throughout the day. Kelly is at school until 1 o'clock each day, the children are at Hans', and so there is time for checking in with each other. </p>
<p>I did take some time to sit with my tea and read my book, something I really must do more often. I have so many magazines to go through that reading them feels like a chore. Reading my book is pure pleasure! I'm enjoying the story, fiction, about a young woman traveling with her husband in the 1800s via wagon train to set up a household in a very deserted Colorado, far from home and family. It is written as though it's a journal and is entertaining, informative, and a good fast read to boot. </p>
<p>Mirei called at 9:30 tonight, sounding full of energy and excitement. She talks so fast on the phone, and so loudly, that it is often hard to understand her! I have no trouble knowing what she is saying in person, but both Bryn and I agree that we often wonder if she is speaking a language we know when she's on the phone. Soo was there, and Mirei did tell me that, and that she was not going to bed yet, in her <strong>big</strong> bed, and that she wasn't in her pajamas "not yet". She held the phone up to Bryn's ear, told him it was me, and then I heard him tell her to say "goodnight", which she did with great fervor. Funny little girl, is our Mirei! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/07/wednesday_morning_with_finn.html">Wednesday Morning with Finn</a></h2>
								<p>It doesn't always work out for both Susan and me, but I try to keep Wednesday morning open for a few hours with Finn here at our place. He gets to explore all the toys here, new drawers and cupboards, and a garden as well. This last was the highlight today; it was a beautiful day, not too windy, cold, or hot... just right! So the door was open, and Finn took advantage of the freedom that gave him. </p>
<p>He arrived at 9:20, not too sure he wanted to let go of his mom, but those stairs up are just too much to resist. Once he reached the top, he turned to wave goodbye, and headed into the main part of the house. Of course, he immediately spotted Doug sitting in his computer chair, so that left me free to tidy up after my breakfast, and even send off a short email. He would much rather be entertained by Doug than by me. Doug carries him around and points out lots of new and interesting things to him.  </p>
<p>Doug went off to shower, so Finn started his explorations in and about the kitchen and garden, once he spotted that open door! I put his sunhat on, although he was in and out so much, that soon I gave up taking it off and putting it back on each time. It was pretty cute to see him playing with the dishes and drawing at the desk fully decked out for the sun! </p>
<p>I had some flowers to plant, and Finn wanted to help by moving the dirt from one place to another. He was soon set with a small pail of loose dry dirt and my spade, which he reluctantly shared with me when I needed it. But he soon learned he would get it right back and we worked together very nicely. We were out there for an hour and a half (on and off) of the three hours he was here, perhaps more. There was lots to discover: toys strewn about, leaves, small stones, and big ones in the garden that he would lug over to me like a cat with a mouse, looking ever so proud of himself! He's just a sweet boy, with a sweet smile, that he can use to advantage. </p>
<p>When we were back in the kitchen he would open one particular cupboard that he sort of knows I don't let him play in. Out would come that little smile, with the eyebrows crooked up as though he had no idea if this were okay or not. Adorable! He responds very well to a gentle "No Finn, shut the door please." which he almost always does. His favourite drawer contains elastics and twist ties and he knows that is just fine. Today he strung lots over his wrists. </p>
<p>At 11 o'clock he was buckled into the little seat for his regular second breakfast here... a bowl of plain oatmeal with mashed blueberries in it. He likes it so much he leans forward for the next bite, each and every time, although he pulls quite the face if he feels a long piece of skin in his mouth. It comes out very quickly(!) but doesn't turn him off the next bite. Since he had still been leaning forward for the last bite, I made him a piece of raisin toast, and to my surprise he ate the entire slice, cut into little cubes, and given to him just two at a time. Any more than that, and they either all went into his mouth or onto the floor. He quite enjoys drinking from a real glass, and it's both small and heavy enough that it doesn't break when it accidentally gets knocked over. "Oh oh!" is what he says and he laughs when I repeat it back to him too. </p>
<p>Today we played "Do you like my hat?", a favourite game with all the little ones in my life. Today we started off with a green plastic top to a container he had used for beads, little animals, etc. and it was perfect, as it was quite stable and he was more than willing to have me put it on his head several times, and smiled when I put it on mine. </p>
<p>Finn likes Mirei's talking doll from Auntie Gail and Uncle Tom. It says "Mama", cries, giggles, and makes the oddest burping noise in the known universe. It also plays a lullaby when you place a tiny teddy against her heart, and Finn signed "more" over and over to hear this. </p>
<p>So, our three hours flew by! There wasn't an unhappy peep out of him the entire time he was here. He was just busy and active, wandering into the living room to look at the little photo album Kelly made for me for Mother's Day last year, delighted when he spotted Uncle Bryn on the first flip through it(!), and had a little extra time with Grandpa too. About five minutes before Susan picked him up, he finally just put his head down on the computer chair, a very obvious clue that he was ready for his nap. Not surprising either, since Susan said when she brought him in, that he would have been asleep in just five more minutes in the car. I like to think he was sound asleep by the time they turned the corner, on their way to pick up Amelia. </p>
<p>I had some IM time with Caillie today, which is such a pleasure. She and Bryn will be here in just one week! How that time has flown by; it used to seem so far away! </p>
<p>Mirei called to chat tonight; she has been staying up later at night since she began power napping in the afternoons... three hours at a time! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/07/a_boy_bubbles_and_a_builder.html">A Boy, Bubbles, More Bugs, and a Builder!</a></h2>
								<p>Thursday was a quiet day around here, with lots of time for a leisurely breakfast which I really love. I guess it is my favourite meal of the day, as by the time I am ready to eat, I know exactly what I want! Doug eats much earlier, and so our first two meals of the day are eaten solo. There are days I thoroughly enjoy a perfectly cooked fried egg, with two freshly cut slices of Acme's crusty "pain au levain" sourdough, toasted, and two slices of "bacon". Other days I have half a banana and surround it with a variety of nuts... raw cashews, Brazil nuts, almonds, and walnuts, just a few of each. Other days I might have "bacon" on the sourdough, or peanut butter on one slice of whole wheat pre-sliced bread, and thin slices of old Canadian cheddar on the other. Oatmeal is another choice, although that tends to be a winter breakfast. Almost always I have a big cup of hot chocolate made with vanilla soy milk, and a really good quality chocolate, currently little chocolate bits that take some serious stirring to dissolve properly. If I don't do it well enough I get to eat the warm chocolate left at the bottom of the cup with a spoon. Mirei likes to do this too! </p>
<p>The day slid by, as they always do, but I had time for a long chat with Uncle Frank, talked about the last few photos to go into his Navy album, called a doula mom for a long visit over the phone with her too, and even got an invitation to visit them when they move next year... to either Italy or Mexico, as yet undecided! The day still went too fast to get everything done I hoped to do, but I did take time for tea and a magazine in mid-afternoon, along with a mid-day snack, and a bit of chocolate.</p>
<p>Doug and I had some errands to run today so dashed off at 2:20 to the post office and the bank. There was a huge long line at the PO but we were at Riku's school in plenty of time. I went inside again today, and smiled when I saw him walking along, hand in hand, chatting up a storm with another boy. He always comes running when he spots me, says goodbye in Chinese to his very friendly female teacher, and starts telling me about his day. He only takes a break after getting him buckled into his car seat, to ask for his snack. Happily settled in, eating cubes of cheese, a small container of fruit ( today he had his freshly picked blackberries in with the strawberries and grapes), and if he's really hungry, a few cookies or a small bit of chocolate. Kung fu seems to be the talk of the week, although he did say his male teacher does not always do real kung fu, but pretend kung fu. </p>
<p>Once home with us, Riku goes into action. Skippy usually gets some attention first, but today there were other things to do outside. He watered some plants for me using the hose, tried to talk me into shooting each other with the water guns, but it was cool by this time, and I would so much rather do this on a hot day on the beach with more space to run from him! That was fine, as the hose occupied him, and then it was in for more food... half a banana and a drink, and then into the tub. Somehow he managed to step into a nest of ants, perhaps, as he had several of them climbing on his legs and in his shoes, and knowing how much he loves to bathe, I decided that would be a good time for it. Well, it was great. There were lots of bubbles, Gumbi, and a dozen ladybugs this afternoon lost amongst the bubbles, so that kept him busy for quite a while. </p>
<p>Then it was upstairs to watch one short episode of "Little Bear", the sweet British animated story of animal friends. I just wish I could manage to get a photo of the look on Riku's face as he watches them interact, but I know a camera would intrude. He just smiles away and really enjoys it so much. Downstairs in fifteen minutes to dig out the blocks and build away in the living room, with Skippy there to watch over it all. We were busy at it when Bryn walked in for him, and was an instant hero having found one particular piece Riku and I had been searching for. </p>
<p>Doug went off to his T'ai Chi class, while I settled in at the computer for some photo sorting and choosing pics for blogs. After dinner, Doug did his magic with those, so I could keep up to date with what I have ready to post. We watched part two of a Canadian TV series, "Swords and Daggers" now available to us on rental DVDs, enjoyed it as much as the first, and came down for that last-minute email check before bedtime. The evenings fly by as fast as the days! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/07/600_blog_entries.html">600 Blog Entries!!!</a></h2>
								<p>... but perhaps they are not all completely finished, so don't go checking for them yet! I am working on them though, one at a time, and now that I know how to upload the photos (once Doug has done whatever he does to them first.. downsizing? and sending them to me via email), it means that Bryn is not involved in this process either. He used to upload my photos for me; I am very technically challenged! </p>
<p>Sean Cody, Bryn's friend, is in town tonight from San Diego, so the plan is for Riku to spend tonight and tomorrow night with us, while they party. Bryn brought him over about 6:15, after dinner at home, and then stayed on for a half hour or so. Riku had been promised dessert here, and there was just enough pineapple-coconut Häagen-Dazs for him to polish off right out of the container, the first time he has ever done this at my house. Of course Bryn does this all the time, and luckily enough there was just enough cinnamon caramel for him to to do the same. It was pretty cute to watch the two of them sitting on the floor, digging in. Doug was less than impressed with the vanishing ice cream! </p>
<p>Bryn did a little building with him before leaving, and once he did, Riku set up a little "tent" for his animals at the foot of the bed, using all the small cloth blankets in his room, and the little chair from the desk. He got in a few more minutes of block building with Doug too, and then I got him ready for bed soon after that. He's a tired boy come Friday and tomorrow is going to be another busy day for him, as there is a Starr King class picnic at a playground, planned for the kindergarten class tomorrow at 11 A.M. </p>
<p>While I got his water, and my clock, etc. set up for the night, Riku sat in bed reading over a new-to-him-book, but actually one of his dad's childhood books "The Magician Who Lost His Magic". He likes to see his dad's name inside the front cover and to hear that when his dad was a little boy, just his age, I sat in bed with him and read him the very same book. </p>
<p>The illustrations are just great, some coloured and very detailed and other pages quite simple with black pen drawings, so those, along with the very interesting story, were a hit. We just read one story together, "Christopher and Grandma on Safari", another book that has been in the house for a long time. It had the lyrics to a traditional Maasai "goodbye song" and Riku quite liked the words, repeating them to himself as he settled in for the night.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2008/07/a_picnic_a_visitor_pink_pantie.html">A Picnic, A Visitor, and Grapes for Grandpa</a></h2>
								<p>This was one busy child-filled day, from morning 'til Riku's tuck-in. Riku awoke earlier than usual this morning, at 6, telling me that he had a bad dream. I fell back asleep almost immediately but was vaguely aware of him playing with his animals next to me. At one point he leaned over and asked softly "Are you dreaming, Nana?". I told him I thought I was, but sat up right after that to learn that it was almost 7 o'clock. Riku did lie down beside me between 6 and 7, and I thought he might have slept, but am not sure. We both got up almost immediately after he ate his fruit bowl, and about fifteen minutes later, Riku realized we hadn't read any stories! "Shall we go back to bed and read?" he asked, and I agreed that we should. </p>
<p>We had chosen those books last night and so read "Where the River Begins", a story of two brothers who take a walking trip and camp with their grandfather to find the source of the river that leads to the sea by their home. Riku always enjoys it, and this is another book with wonderful illustrations. Next was "Seven Silly Eaters", an old favourite, followed by "Because a Little Bug Went Ca-Choo!", a book that Riku follows carefully as we read it, and laughs every time at the end of it. We hadn't read "How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight" in ages, and it was fun to read it in the morning for the first time. I went up to shower and came down to find him sitting on the sofa on his own, slowly turning the pages of the "Circle of Life" coffee table book we started the other night. He insisted we look at it while he ate his toast at the table, and we had quite an intense discussion about the seemingly cruel/bizarre/strange customs that many countries have, including our own, with circumcision high on the list (and on Riku's mind), along with goat's blood and feathers and painted blue faces in others! </p>
<p>Bryn and Mirei arrived about 10:15, while I was getting a second batch of mini brownies going, a treat for the picnic.I got such a big long hug from Mirei and she instantly was ready to head out to the garden with Riku. Sean arrived a few minutes later, listened and watched as Riku sang and wrote in Chinese, and interacted with Mirei who thinks Sean is there for her entertainment only. </p>
<p>They were to have taken a lunch along as well to the picnic, but instead I made them a big second breakfast, so that I didn't need to think of something to pack up. They both ate well, and off they went just past 11:30, with Mirei back here for her nap not much more than an hour later. Sean, Bryn, and Riku went to Brent's for a visit, saw the baby, and Brent's parents, and then hiked up the small hill we can see from our living room. Riku enjoys this so much, and I was happy to hear that they had some time there. </p>
<p>I tucked Mirei into bed, and within ten minutes she was sound asleep, as she remained for three hours! I had lots of time to walk over to the hospital, drop off the brownies at the staff room, and say hello to all those familiar faces. I haven't been to a birth since the end of May; I miss it, and the camaraderie of the nurses too.</p>
<p>I had a long chat with Kelly, and drank my tea, as I listened while she read me three or four children's books she bought at a publishers last week, along with some others, part of her summer school course. They were wonderful, and Kelly read one particular one with a great accent! </p>
<p>Mirei awoke at the two hour point, Doug went into her and was told "go away Grandpa!", much to his surprise and mine too. I went in just then to see her roll over and go back to sleep! </p>
<p>When Mirei woke I put her very first pair of underwear on her, <strong>pink</strong>, of course, and she got to choose her favourite of the three pairs. How proud she was, first checking herself out in the mirror, then insisting on showing Grandpa, and didn't want any slacks on until "I show Daddy!" She was at the top of the stairs, twisting herself around as best she could so Bryn could see her the second she walked in the door! It was adorable of course and soon she was out in the garden, wearing only the underwear and shoes. </p>
<p>Caillie asked me to call her at her Dad's, Russell called as Bryn and Sean arrived back with Riku, and the house was as busy as could be! Riku came in bearing two new pictures for me, these with flags, as Bryn told me that was his main theme today.He told me this morning that he had left "a beautiful drawing I did for you at school, at my house, but I will get it for you, or maybe you will have to share it!" I end up getting all the artwork anyway, so I'm sure I will see it soon enough. </p>
<p>Soon after that, Bryn and Sean left to pick up Akane to go for dinner; I had volunteered to keep both children here until Riku's bedtime. Bryn had planned to take her, but from the minute she woke up, Mirei said "I want to stay at Nana's house!" and that seemed fair as she has had very little time here over the past week. </p>
<p>She and Riku had a long bath together, Mirei insisting on seeing herself wrapped in the big new <strong>pink</strong> towel we bought for her last Sunday, and then were ready for a big dinner... mushroom risotto, lots of broccoli, cooked carrots for Riku, and much to my surprise about half a big raw carrot! Pink strawberry ice cream for Mirei for dessert, pineapple coconut for Riku (Doug picked up a new supply for him this morning), and then they had some time to play in the living room before Bryn and Sean were back at 7:10 to pick up Mirei. </p>
<p>I got Riku ready for bed immediately, as tomorrow is another busy day for him... reading program with Bryn from 9–11, and then here for two hours over lunch, before he leaves with the Smith family to go to a space centre and movie in Oakland. We read two stories from the book I won in grade one, which we don't read very often. One of the pages had been ripped and then redone with tissue like paper to protect it, and Riku wanted to know how that happened ... one of my younger siblings tore it ... and whether or not I was angry or sad. Sad was the answer. </p>
<p>He was sound asleep at 8 P.M., and Doug and I shared a noodle dish, which I had asked Bryn to bring home from the restaurant for us. It saved me from having to think about what to have for dinner after this busy day. I took mine upstairs to eat while reading my book and finally finishing my first cup of tea of the day, reheated many time!</p>
