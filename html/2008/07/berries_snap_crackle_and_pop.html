								<h2>Berries, Snap, Crackle, and Pop!</h2>
								<p>Our plan for the 4th of July was to go berry picking with Susan and the children. Bryn dropped the children off about 9:30, and an hour and a half slipped by with a second breakfast for them both... "Grandpa's toast" and hot chocolate for Mirei and porridge for Riku with berries and banana today. </p>
<p>Mirei was feeling her "oats" (read a tired girl), and was bugging her brother whenever she got the chance, trying to run off with Skippy and Kitty-Cat, preferring his animals even when given her own basket with animals and blankets. They did eventually sort it out and made up a little nest of blankets in the bedroom, then played nicely there for a long time while I packed up our snacks. </p>
<p>Ralph, our very friendly neighbour, was outside, and I wished him a happy 4th; Mirei did as well, and then told him we were going berry picking. He was very impressed at how well she spoke, as they have a great granddaughter the same age, and he can't understand her as well as he did all of Mirei's chatting. It's amazing how verbal, friendly, and open this little girl is. Ralph's wife came over to say hello too, and she also got to hear about our plan for the day. </p>
<p>Mirei needed her nap and our hope was that she would fall asleep almost instantly, so she could pick berries as she expected to, but instead Riku nodded off quite quickly, while Mirei pointed out the trees, and the buildings, and the trucks to us! Fifteen minutes before we arrived at Webb Ranch Farm, she finally gave in. We lucked out though, as Riku and I were able to get out of the car quietly, meeting up with Susan and the children, who had arrived at exactly the same time. Doug sat in the car with a sleeping girl for an hour and a quarter, reading, while we gathered blackberries. What fun this was! Amelia and Riku were in their glory, with fingers stained pink and purple, while searching for the big plump berries. Finn was in his glory as well, as he could wander freely down a long corridor of berry bushes and still be easily seen. He tried his hand at picking berries too, but was very cautious when he realized that those branches were prickly. Turns out that things on the ground were just as interesting, and he found lots of sticks and stones. An hour passed very quickly and we decided to try our hand at raspberries next. </p>
<p>Mirei had just wakened, so off we went to the new section. The pickings weren't as good there, and it was much harder to find ripe berries. Mirei, who had turned down a snack fifteen minutes earlier, decided she was hungry so she and I went back to the car, leaving Doug, Susan, and Amelia to continue on, with Finn on Mommy's back. Riku on his own decided to follow Mirei and me, and just as we sat down at a table in a shady spot, Riku came running up to us, very proud he had found us on his own. He liked our cool little spot, and we had a tiny "picnic" of snacks and juice. There were horses just across the road so we went over to check them out. It may have been the first time that Mirei had seen a horse, and she just did not want to leave. "Hi horse. Hi!" over and over again. Riku went off again to explore a little playhouse, Mirei joined him and then Susan, Doug, Amelia, and Finn joined us as well. Three children played inside the tiny building, while Amelia preferred to explore from the roof, making us all a little nervous as it wasn't exactly a sturdy structure! </p>
<p>Everyone by this time was tired and hungry, so we went our separate ways, Susan and the children to Portola Valley for a sleepover with friends, and Doug, Riku, Mirei, and I to a Mexican restaurant for lunch. Mirei was full of energy and enthusiasm and flirted outrageously with a table of two couples, but both children ate quesadillas and french fries, drank lots of water ("pretty blue glass with ice, lots of ice!" said Mirei), and we headed right home, after a busy and fun day out. </p>
<p>Bryn had called to say that they would pick up veggie Chinese food for dinner; he and Akane had a rare day alone today, so went out for dim sum, and then off to do some shopping to get the children's "twin" beds set up for sleeping tonight. Big night, with both children in separate beds, in their own room. Dinner was delicious, everyone was tuckered out, and when they left at 7:30, Doug and I headed upstairs with a wonderful British movie rental, called "Housewife 49", based on a true story in wartime Britain. The bombing segments in the movie fit right in with the booming fireworks outside tonight. Even though there was heavy fog, we still saw lots of starbursts, and the accompanying booms reverberating against the hills of rock behind us. They went on well after midnight, Doug tells me, but I was asleep before that.</p>
