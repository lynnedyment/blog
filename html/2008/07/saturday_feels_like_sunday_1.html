								<h2>Saturday... Feels Like Sunday!</h2>
								<p>I woke this morning, thinking that Riku had his reading program with Bryn at 9 A.M. but quickly realized it is just Saturday, so two more days in the weekend! Yahoo! Bryn had suggested last night that we go off to the new skateboard park in the neighbourhood first thing this morning, so I got up and showered early, with lots of time for the paper and a leisurely breakfast. They had a nice slow morning at home too, with no plans to rush out to do a thing. </p>
<p>We had problems with our computers last night, so except for one instance, we only got email through once last evening, and none at all overnight. Doug was on the phone to the service provider several times, and in between Kelly and I managed to find some time to talk to each other. The children's plane tickets arrived, Opa is in the hospital, Kelly is finding her summer school courses very interesting but time consuming, and is looking forward to having her summer holidays start close to the end of July. It's rare that we both have time in the mornings at home to chat and catch up, so it was wonderful. </p>
<p>Riku was expecting a four year old visitor at his home at 3 P.M., the daughter of a friend of Akane's from art school here, so I suggested he come over for a morning visit with us, and Mirei have her nap here at noon. She slept for the first time in her own bed last night, in "Riku's" room, so an early nap is called for. When told of the plan, Riku said he would like Mirei to come over with him, so a half hour later the door bell was ringing madly, with a smiling Riku peeking in the glass, and Mirei hard up behind him shouting, yes really truly shouting "Nana! Nana!" as though she hadn't seen me in ages. In fact, when we picked Riku up a few days ago that is exactly what he said "Nana, I haven't seen you in <strong>ages</strong>!"and then asked me what "ages" meant. </p>
<p>The two of them kept so busy that the next two and a half hours really flew by. Mirei had brought over her pink balloon from Doug's party, and so I blew up another for Riku. I "squealed" it for them, let it fly loose a few times, and then tied it up so they could both bat them around until they lost interest. Mirei decided she wanted to go out in the garden, and struggled to buckle the tiny straps on her sandals herself. She has always been very determined to do everything on her own, but much more so, and much more verbal about it too since starting nursery school two weeks ago. We hear "I do it!" a lot, but she did finally allow Riku to help her at last. </p>
<p>We found a great basketball hoop, with a base full of sand, at the corner last night coming back from the berry farm. People often just leave things on the street when they are done with them around here, and it often works in our favour too, both ways. There is even a new-to-us bookcase in the living room now, filled with the overflow of children's books from the bedroom. Anyway, Doug dragged the basketball stand home and Bryn dragged it up the stairs to the back yard, with a little "help" from the children. Riku is loving it, and spent lots of time trying to get his balloon and a ball into it. </p>
<p>As soon as that ended, it was on to watering the plants with many plastic glasses full of water. Mirei then swept up, while Riku rescued a "pill" bug. He wondered what it liked to eat, so Grandpa went on the Internet and found out all about them.. they have gills, fourteen legs, need to have lots of dampness to stay alive... wet paper towels did the trick, and eat rotting vegetation. Riku found some leaves and made a "home" for it in the lid of a plastic container. This took lots of time, and he ended this little science lesson by making a drawing of the bug, after checking it out carefully with a magnifying glass. I just went to check on the newcomer, and apparently it is out visiting, or has moved on. Ah well, there is no shortage of these bugs-with-many-names in our garden. </p>
<p>Mirei has decided that she very much enjoys washing her hands in the bathroom sink, all on her own. Usually she drags the heavy wooden steps over to the sink, but today decided to just pull out the wicker storage basket instead and stand on that! I'm surprised it held her up, but it did. Neither Amelia nor Riku even thought to do this, but Mirei, well trust her to come up with something new.  </p>
<p>Plans for our day changed, as they are wont to do around here. Kai, an old classmate of Riku's from his "Little Angels" nursery school program, was available for a play date at Riku's at noon hour. Even though they live just a few blocks apart, they don't often see each other, so this was a treat. Riku does enjoy having a boy over to play Ultraman with, or just to play in the room, with all the other toys. Doug offered to walk him home via the skateboard park, but Riku wanted to spend the extra hour here. </p>
<p>He has been giving his dad a hard time about talking on his cell phone the past two days. A new law was passed making it illegal to use phones that are hand held; he told me this morning that his dad was breaking the rules, and I encouraged him to keep at him about it! Bryn told me this morning that even though he was on for just one minute with a friend, he felt it was too stressful having a monitor going off in the back seat, so hung up in protest! I must get Mirei in on the act. </p>
<p>As soon as Bryn picked him up at noon hour, Mirei chose a Caillou book for her tuck-in time, suggested a big "family hug" with Doug, said "night night Grandpa!" and off we went. To "settle" herself today, she played "this little piggie went to market" on her own toes, followed by "itsy bitsy spider", kissed me three times on the cheek, pulled my hair over to one side of my head... it's not a pretty picture when I leave her room!, and after ten minutes was fast asleep. I nodded off to for fifteen minutes, and Mirei slept on for another two hours and fifteen minutes! We were snuggled up reading on the sofa when Bryn walked in to take her home; he and Doug had been off to the hardware store, so the timing was perfect. We had another family hug with Bryn too this time, and off they went at 3 P.M. There were lots of people at her house, and I bet she had a grand ol' time socializing! </p>
<p>Doug and I sat down to some serious photo work! We accomplished so much, which really means Doug did lots of work, while I encouraged him. I did sort through lots of photos though, deleting with some reluctance the ones I felt I could live without. I annotated and put up Doug's birthday album tonight, added blog photos, a fairly recent accomplishment, with much thanks to Bryn and Doug, and felt so good about it all. </p>
<p>Fresh corn on the cob for dinner tonight! Yum! I bought eight cobs from Webb Farm yesterday, and I think it has been the best corn I have had in years in California. Tasted just like Ontario corn. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched part two of a British detective series we started the other night, and enjoyed it just as much. </p>
