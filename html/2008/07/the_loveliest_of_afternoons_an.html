								<h2>The Loveliest of Afternoons.. and Eight Days to Go!</h2>
								<p>Doug and I had a quiet day at home working on photos, emails, and for me the usual Monday chores. I also talked to both Bryn and Caillie on IM for quite a long time, about how quickly their trip is coming up and where they are going to sleep next week. Bryn would like his own room this year, and Caillie decided she would sleep in the middle room where the children sleep. I love having this way of keeping in touch with them, as often phone calls are not possible for us. It's quick and easy to find out if someone is online though. Lucky me, living in this time period. How my mom and dad would have loved such easy access to their grandchildren, too many miles away! </p>
<p>Of course, Monday also means it's Riku's sleepover day, something that we all really look forward to. We picked him up from school/camp at 3:05, and he was barely in his car seat before he started telling us all about his day. He learned some more Kung Fu, played in the playground, and saw big boys showing their nipples! For a good portion of the way home, this was <strong>the</strong> topic. We told him that in the olden days women's ankles were what people were giggling about, and tried to downplay it all by talking about elbows and noses being pretty funny too, but that made no impact at all. Nipples and penises are in the conversation a lot these days, for whatever reason. This seems to be true among a few of my friends' grandchildren too, and the comments range from "penises are interesting but nipples are <strong>very</strong> interesting" to "I have nipples but my mommy's nipples are <strong>very</strong> big!", both comments from boys.  </p>
<p>Once at home, we gave Riku one of the "house" gifts we bought yesterday, a bug collecting jar. We couldn't have found a better one, as from the moment he opened it, with a sincere and big "thank you!", Riku was a busy boy. He was thrilled with the magnified lid, the separate magnifying glass, and the tongs to pick up the specimens with. He found two pill bugs, and as he put them in the jar he told me that one of them was having babies. I looked and only saw something that looked as though it was being dragged, but Riku was very excited about it, as he went about collecting grass and dirt and wetting a paper towel for them. He was bent over the jar, checking it all out and had me go over to look too. Much to my surprise there were brand new baby pill bugs running here and there, white, ghostly, barely visible teeny creatures, so tiny that Doug missed them the first time he looked. What a good parent Riku is, checking them all out every few minutes to make sure all was well. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, he was curious about what ants ate, so up on Doug's lap he went, while Doug found some good sites explaining all about them. After his tub, he asked if he could see what scrotums looked like, and of course Grandpa once more found the right place to look. There were outside pictures, and inside pictures, with tubes and vessels, etc. until Riku decided it wasn't worth more time looking. </p>
<p>Dinner time followed, in two courses. First came fresh corn on the cob from Webb Ranch Farm from our Friday excursion. Three-day-old corn shouldn't have tasted as good as it did, but it was the best corn we have had in ages, and we divided up four cobs. Riku couldn't manage eating it off the cob with his two bottom teeth missing but ate every kernel with a spoon. He was pretty full after that (he had eaten a banana too, just before his tub), so we waited forty-five minutes before sitting down again for a small bowl of pasta, a tiny bit of custard with his blackberries from Friday, and finishing off with a very small bowl of coconut/pineapple ice cream which he liked <strong>so</strong> much! </p>
<p>Riku was ready for bed at 7 P.M., talked to his daddy for a few minutes, and then we had time for two long stories before tuck in. However, the sweetest thing happened first; he took Skippy, whom he usually sleeps with here, and told him very quietly and gently that tonight he was going to sleep all by himself, told him he was growing up and he would be just fine, and tucked him into his basket beside the bed. Riku has been reading each night before bed with Bryn, but tonight just wanted to be read to. He did read two sentences, though, and then settled down to be read to. I walked out the door at 7:40, leaving behind a sleeping boy and an independent Skippy too. </p>
<p>Lots of emails came in today, so I kept busy answering as many of them as I could before heading for bed myself at 11 P.M. with a slightly sore throat and quite sore ears. I gargled with salt water and used the Neti pot many times today hoping to head this off. It usually works, so fingers crossed. </p>
