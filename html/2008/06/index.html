								<h2><a href="/2008/06/first_day_at_chineseamerican_s.html">First Day at Chinese-American Summer Camp for Riku</a></h2>
								<p>And so begins another week... with cool breezes, some cloud cover, and much more comfortable temps too. Ahhh, San Francisco weather! </p>
<p>The day flew by with lots of household chores... the usual Monday morning laundry, some tidying up, but mostly working with photos of my Dad for the Ancestry album, thanks to lots of hard work on Doug's part... sending them on to my siblings, and taking part in a long email discussion about the cars our parents owned over the years. The boys remembered more about all the details of the vehicles themselves, the makes and models. Don remembered that a truck Dad and Grandpa had used while providing gravel for the Welland Canal was eventually just left there to be covered in water when the work was done. </p>
<p>We talked about Dad putting two long benches in the back of the truck, for a long trip to Havelock one summer, when we were very young. Gail and Glenn, just a month old, were up front with Mom and Dad, while Ian, Sheldon, cousin Geraldine, and I sat in the back, with a tarp over us to provide protection from the elements during what must have seemed a long trip to two year old me. Sheldon remembered that the Queen Elizabeth Highway was not finished until later that year, and so we would have been travelling on stone and dirt roads. Ah, the good ol' days! </p>
<p>Riku started his summer day camp program at the Chinese-American International School this morning at 9 A.M. Bryn and Mirei walked in with him and Bryn was quite impressed with what he saw... well dressed,  pulled-together moms from the school, acting as escorts for the new students. There was a lavish table chock full of pastries, coffee, and juice, just in case anyone was a little nibbly. Bryn walked Riku to his classroom and McKenzie, one of the girls from Riku's class was there, very happy to see his familiar face. There are at least six other Starr King students attending this session, and Riku waved goodbye to his dad, quite happy with this new situation.</p>
<p>It was Mirei's tturn to be dropped off next. Bryn says she is very quiet on the way to school. Interesting, as she is a less quiet child than Riku in so many ways. He was and is quite chatty in the car, making conversation or singing along to various tapes we carry with us. Bryn always pointed out lots of things out along the route to "Little Angels" and it wasn't long before Riku anticipated seeing them. However, despite being quiet as usual, Mirei was quite prepared to walk into school this morning, with nary a backward glance. Bryn kindly reported to me on his way to the office, knowing I would be wondering about the children's start to their morning. </p>
<p>Doug and I picked Riku up after school at 3 P.M.; he told us lots about his day... he learned some kung fu moves and demonstrated them for me, and they had running around the playground time, and had to count to <strong>five</strong> and write to the number five as well in Chinese. Riku thought this was very easy, as he can count to 100, and write to about 68. Tomorrow apparently they will get separated into different groups, no doubt by how well they speak Chinese. I hope he gets to remain with some of his c, so all sounded well with this summer camp.  He likes the teachers too, the male and the female he met today.</p>
<p>He had the usual snacks in the car on the way here, and was ready to get back to his cardboard project. This time he decided the animals needed a playground and set about constructing a slide with lots of folded paper and lots of Scotch tape. The dogs were soon "chatting" up a storm in their new play area, and were kept busy for at least an hour. </p>
<p>Soon it was tub time, dinner, and an early bedtime, so that he could read a half dozen pages to me from his Sunday reading program book out loud to me. I can't believe he can so easily read the bigger words in this book, considering it was just last week he read whole sentences for the first time! We had time for two of his current favourite books "Henry and Mudge". I love the way Riku smiles and chuckles at all the antics of the characters, despite having heard the stories many times. He told me he would like to have a dog; I guess most children would. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep at 7:40 P.M., after making sure the animals were "asleep" in the box at the foot of his bed. He told me to be very careful when I went to bed, and not knock over their blankets. Night night. </p>
