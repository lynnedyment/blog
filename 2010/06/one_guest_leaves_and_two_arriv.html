								<h2>One Guest Leaves and Two Arrive!</h2>
								<p>This is certainly going to be our busiest summer ever, with Warren leaving today after a wonderful nine-day visit, immediately followed by Bryn's and Mirei's arrival fifteen minutes after saying goodbye to Warren. He was a wonderful house guest, and we hope he comes back to visit again before we leave San Francisco. </p>
<p>We stopped to take a few photos with Warren before our final goodbyes, and I was hoping we wouldn't miss seeing Bryn and Mirei come through those doors at the International Terminal. We were there in lots of time, and more than ready to see that little girl running towards us, with her grinning daddy in the background. She jumped right up into my arms, giving me the biggest hugs for the longest time, and then it was Grandpa's turn, and they both enjoyed a long hug while he carried her to the end of the terminal. One would never know that she was at the end of an eleven-hour plane trip, with a solid day behind her before that even started. What a wonderful traveler Mirei is. Lucky Daddy. </p>
<p>It was a busy day from beginning to end. After helping me form the dough for the rising of a new loaf of semolina bread — how I love to see that little girl in an apron (!) — Mirei settled right in, trying hard to do a little bit of many of her favourite things in our house. She cuddled and fed her dolls, drew a picture and cut it out for the fridge door, played with all the stuffed animals on the bed in her room, doctored them up with the doctor kit, and went upstairs to check on things up there too. She and Grandpa walked to the post box also, with one baby carefully tucked into the stroller for the errand. </p>
<p>It was a gorgeous day, and so after changing into a new dress that had arrived for her, and after lunch and more playtime, she and I walked to the playground on Potrero Avenue. She checked it all out ... sliding down the slides, climbing on the rope steps, twirling around on the spinner, but had the most fun with a little guy not yet two, rocking with him on the wide teeter-totter and balancing on the top of it as well. She was very motherly with him, and his grandma, visiting from South Carolina, commented on how gentle she was. </p>
<p>Once home, Mirei got out the PlayDoh and got busy making a great Christmas tree "cookie" complete with decorations, and a very tiny adorable "tortilla" on a small "plate". Next came a platter of "sushi", offered up to her Dad, Grandpa, and me with the little verse she learned from me before leaving San Francisco: "Open your hands, and close your eyes, and I will put in a <strong>big</strong> surprise!" </p>
<p>She and Grandpa spent some time tossing a small open ball between them and he had her laughing that hard belly laugh that at some point disappears from children, but is the loveliest sound in the world. </p>
<p>Dinner time, tub time with three babies, new pink pajamas, and two stories followed before tuck-in time at 8:30. She slept for seven-plus hours on the plane overnight and there were lots of big yawns throughout the day, so I'm hoping she sleeps right through the night. </p>
<p>One of the most touching moments today: while I was holding Mirei in her warm pink towel after her tub, she held my face and seriously said, "Let me look at you, Nana", followed a minute later by, "I want to be just like you when I am grown up." </p>
