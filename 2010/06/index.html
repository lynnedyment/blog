								<h2><a href="/2010/06/post_17.html">A Visit to Stow Lake with Isobel and Roger</a></h2>
								<p>After a lovely and very tasty dinner last night with Isobel and Roger at "Basil Thai", our current favourite Thai restaurant here in the city, we learned that they had part of the day free today. So, we picked them up at their hotel at 10 A.M. and went off for a little tour of the city. We went to the top of the DeYoung Museum in Golden Gate park for the lovely view of the city from that vantage point, then drove along the Great Highway for a look at Ocean Beach. It was a lovely day and we stopped in at Louis' Diner at the top of the old Sutro Baths ruins, and had a great view while we ate a tasty lunch. </p>
<p>Our last stop of the day was a stroll around Stow Lake; I used to walk in this area so often with Amelia and Finn, and visit there with all the children over the years, and I miss it. It's a lovely spot for a stroll, and I must get there more this summer with Riku and Mirei. </p>
<p>Isobel and Roger enjoyed it all, and at 2 P.M. we dropped them back at their hotel for the beginning of their tour of San Francisco by bus, and then a train trip tomorrow to Seattle, heading for Alaska a few days later. </p>
<p>We have visited with them in their home in England, and met up with them two years ago in Las Vegas, so it was fun to spend some time with them again. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/06/one_guest_leaves_and_two_arriv.html">One Guest Leaves and Two Arrive!</a></h2>
								<p>This is certainly going to be our busiest summer ever, with Warren leaving today after a wonderful nine-day visit, immediately followed by Bryn's and Mirei's arrival fifteen minutes after saying goodbye to Warren. He was a wonderful house guest, and we hope he comes back to visit again before we leave San Francisco. </p>
<p>We stopped to take a few photos with Warren before our final goodbyes, and I was hoping we wouldn't miss seeing Bryn and Mirei come through those doors at the International Terminal. We were there in lots of time, and more than ready to see that little girl running towards us, with her grinning daddy in the background. She jumped right up into my arms, giving me the biggest hugs for the longest time, and then it was Grandpa's turn, and they both enjoyed a long hug while he carried her to the end of the terminal. One would never know that she was at the end of an eleven-hour plane trip, with a solid day behind her before that even started. What a wonderful traveler Mirei is. Lucky Daddy. </p>
<p>It was a busy day from beginning to end. After helping me form the dough for the rising of a new loaf of semolina bread — how I love to see that little girl in an apron (!) — Mirei settled right in, trying hard to do a little bit of many of her favourite things in our house. She cuddled and fed her dolls, drew a picture and cut it out for the fridge door, played with all the stuffed animals on the bed in her room, doctored them up with the doctor kit, and went upstairs to check on things up there too. She and Grandpa walked to the post box also, with one baby carefully tucked into the stroller for the errand. </p>
<p>It was a gorgeous day, and so after changing into a new dress that had arrived for her, and after lunch and more playtime, she and I walked to the playground on Potrero Avenue. She checked it all out ... sliding down the slides, climbing on the rope steps, twirling around on the spinner, but had the most fun with a little guy not yet two, rocking with him on the wide teeter-totter and balancing on the top of it as well. She was very motherly with him, and his grandma, visiting from South Carolina, commented on how gentle she was. </p>
<p>Once home, Mirei got out the PlayDoh and got busy making a great Christmas tree "cookie" complete with decorations, and a very tiny adorable "tortilla" on a small "plate". Next came a platter of "sushi", offered up to her Dad, Grandpa, and me with the little verse she learned from me before leaving San Francisco: "Open your hands, and close your eyes, and I will put in a <strong>big</strong> surprise!" </p>
<p>She and Grandpa spent some time tossing a small open ball between them and he had her laughing that hard belly laugh that at some point disappears from children, but is the loveliest sound in the world. </p>
<p>Dinner time, tub time with three babies, new pink pajamas, and two stories followed before tuck-in time at 8:30. She slept for seven-plus hours on the plane overnight and there were lots of big yawns throughout the day, so I'm hoping she sleeps right through the night. </p>
<p>One of the most touching moments today: while I was holding Mirei in her warm pink towel after her tub, she held my face and seriously said, "Let me look at you, Nana", followed a minute later by, "I want to be just like you when I am grown up." </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/06/first_beach_day_with_mirei.html">First Beach Day with Mirei</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei, much to the surprise of all of us in the house, slept a solid thirteen hours, except for a request for water at 3 A.M. Bryn went off for breakfast with Brent at 7 o'clock and I had two and a half hours on my own before she woke, smiling and snuggly. </p>
<p>She requested scrambled eggs for breakfast this morning and so I had her do the scrambling and the stirring too. She ate it all up along with two slices of her favourite "bacon" and the yummy semolina bread she had helped with yesterday. </p>
<p>It was another gorgeous day, sunny and warm, and while I tidied up the kitchen and got a few little jobs done, Mirei, armed with a bucket of warm water and two cloths, got busy giving her tricycle a thorough cleaning. I'm sorry I didn't get a photo of her with the trike upside down, scrubbing away at it, but after drying it off she had a good ride around the garden. I promised her I would take her out on the sidewalk with it tomorrow. </p>
<p>She had babies to take care of again today, and kept herself busy bustling about with them and the doctor kit, plus spent quite a bit of time drawing again, both in the morning and late afternoon. </p>
<p>Last night we had decided that we would take the bus to the little Aquatic Park beach, across from Ghirardelli Square. Mirei insisted that we use her pretty pink spacious bag for our "picnic" which we did ... lots of goodies ... yogurt, oranges, grapes, pistachios, cheese, tiny cookies, and her water bottle.  </p>
<p>Doug had the car today, and how lucky we are to be able to get to this lovely little spot by public transportation. We had such a grand time; it could not have been more perfect. I had taken along some tiny containers so I collected water for mud pies until Mirei spotted some older children running in and out of the waves, and decided that she would do the same. That was the end of the mud pies for a good long time. She laughed and ran in and out of the water, just barely beating the waves to shore. </p>
<p>I was surprised that she didn't seem the least bit sleepy on the bus ride home, and instead paid a great deal of attention to everyone who was sitting near us, including a very tiny baby in a car seat just in front of us. </p>
<p>There was lots of sand between Mirei's toes, so she stripped down as soon as we came into the house and into the tub she went. I offered to make homemade mac' and cheese for her, but she told me she really wanted pizza. How lovely to have this bread dough in the fridge, as I just rolled it out into a smallish circle, topped it with some bottled Italian sauce, homemade pesto, a little olive oil, and Parmesan cheese, all that I had in the house. It was <strong>so</strong> delicious! Mirei told me so at least three times and ate all five small pieces I gave to her, along with broccoli and corn. </p>
<p>After dinner, she did her spelling with Bryn ... ten words, I believe, and she got them all perfect: a, the, she, am, and others I will ask Bryn about. After that she read him about ten pages in "Are You My Mother?" I love her animation as she reads it to him, not to mention the positions she gets into, but reading it word for word, with only two mistakes, despite reading upside down and backwards! </p>
<p>The minute Doug walked in the door tonight, Mirei ran to him, asking him "How was your day, Grandpa?" Doug was sure that I had suggested she ask, but I was as surprised and pleased as he was to hear her ask him. She asked if he would do something with her, so the two of them sat at the table drawing for a little while. </p>
<p>Bryn read her some extra stories just before bedtime, and after one new story from me, this little one was asleep at 7:40.  </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/06/mirei_lunches_with_the_ladies.html">Mirei Lunches with "The Ladies"</a></h2>
								<p>Each Wednesday in Cupertino, Ellen and whatever friends are available meet up for lunch but the regulars seem to be Ellen, Victoria, Angie, and Grace. They're a great group and I joined them last month for the first time in a very long time. Last night Ellen emailed asking if Mirei and I could make it down for this event, and so made plans to do this!</p>
<p>We had lots of time at home though before leaving, so Mirei watched "Caillou" in French while I finished up my shower, she scrambled <strong>two</strong> eggs for her breakfast, and had lots of time for PlayDoh cookies, as well as singing "Happy Birthday" to Auntie Beth along with the rest of us here. </p>
<p>Later on Mirei did the funniest thing while doing her morning drawing... last night Doug had drawn a "bald iggle" for her, a funny little cartoon character he started cppying/drawing when he was a teenager. Mirei liked it a lot, and so this morning she drew one right beside his and then proudly showed it to him. </p>
<p>We left for Ellen's at 10:45 and chatted and sang all the way there. Mirei was anticipating playing with Skippy, Ellen's wee dog, but it turned out that she was happiest watching Ellen toss the ball to Skippy in the yard and in the pool!, and not having to get to close to what she thought looked like too-sharp teeth and nails to her. However, there was a big closet of dress up clothes to go through and Mirei quite liked the looks of the angel wings with high heels! </p>
<p>When it was time to leave for the bakery where we were eating al fresca Ellen told Mirei she could wear the  wings she discovered pretty quickly in that fun closet! </p>
<p>Mirei always says she is shy but it sure doesn't take her long to warm up. She went around the table shaking hands... we practiced a little this morning... and holding hands with Grace, the lovely 92 year old regular. Mirei held court quite easily; everyone was intrigued and delighted with her... with her language skills, her drawing of Victoria, with her sense of humour and her entertainment skills. She kept them all smiling and laughing and coming back for more! It really was such fun watching her interact with each and every one of them on their own. </p>
<p>Victoria said she would like to take her home for two days, and Mirei told her she would come to her house one day, but she couldn't stay for two days because I would be lonely. However, when Angie suggested we could get together for a picnic Mirei piped up with "Everybody could come!" It would be such fun if this happened. </p>
<p>After saying our goodbyes, we stopped in at a market with Ellen all the while pretending to be "the mommy", and Mirei "the baby." Ellen kindly sat in the back seat with Mirei to and from the restaurant and the game continued until we reached Ellen's home. Mirei received a beautiful silver and turquoise bracelet from Ellen, and Victoria gave her a beaded "eye of the god" bracelet that she was wearing! </p>
<p>I asked Mirei not to sleep on the way home (knowing perfectly well that she would), but she promised me she would close her eyes but would talk to me. She didn't. We weren't five minutes from Ellen's before she was sound asleep. That was a fun exciting few hours for her and for all of us too; we said we would be back again soon. </p>
<p>I had promised Mirei this morning that she could paint when we got home and she promptly reminded me of that promise. She did a bright sunny Caillou-coloured painting of a girl with flowers and clouds. Later she drew a sweet picture of Grace with a big smile and lots of hair beside the one she had done of Victoria at the restaurant. </p>
<p>Bath, dessert, and then some quiet time playing with her babies while I rested on her bed for fifteen solid minutes. Then Mirei came in, covered me with a blanket, piled stuffed animals around me and a baby beside me and kissed me. I knew I had to get up then or she really would be tucking me in! </p>
