								<h2>First Beach Day with Mirei</h2>
								<p>Mirei, much to the surprise of all of us in the house, slept a solid thirteen hours, except for a request for water at 3 A.M. Bryn went off for breakfast with Brent at 7 o'clock and I had two and a half hours on my own before she woke, smiling and snuggly. </p>
<p>She requested scrambled eggs for breakfast this morning and so I had her do the scrambling and the stirring too. She ate it all up along with two slices of her favourite "bacon" and the yummy semolina bread she had helped with yesterday. </p>
<p>It was another gorgeous day, sunny and warm, and while I tidied up the kitchen and got a few little jobs done, Mirei, armed with a bucket of warm water and two cloths, got busy giving her tricycle a thorough cleaning. I'm sorry I didn't get a photo of her with the trike upside down, scrubbing away at it, but after drying it off she had a good ride around the garden. I promised her I would take her out on the sidewalk with it tomorrow. </p>
<p>She had babies to take care of again today, and kept herself busy bustling about with them and the doctor kit, plus spent quite a bit of time drawing again, both in the morning and late afternoon. </p>
<p>Last night we had decided that we would take the bus to the little Aquatic Park beach, across from Ghirardelli Square. Mirei insisted that we use her pretty pink spacious bag for our "picnic" which we did ... lots of goodies ... yogurt, oranges, grapes, pistachios, cheese, tiny cookies, and her water bottle.  </p>
<p>Doug had the car today, and how lucky we are to be able to get to this lovely little spot by public transportation. We had such a grand time; it could not have been more perfect. I had taken along some tiny containers so I collected water for mud pies until Mirei spotted some older children running in and out of the waves, and decided that she would do the same. That was the end of the mud pies for a good long time. She laughed and ran in and out of the water, just barely beating the waves to shore. </p>
<p>I was surprised that she didn't seem the least bit sleepy on the bus ride home, and instead paid a great deal of attention to everyone who was sitting near us, including a very tiny baby in a car seat just in front of us. </p>
<p>There was lots of sand between Mirei's toes, so she stripped down as soon as we came into the house and into the tub she went. I offered to make homemade mac' and cheese for her, but she told me she really wanted pizza. How lovely to have this bread dough in the fridge, as I just rolled it out into a smallish circle, topped it with some bottled Italian sauce, homemade pesto, a little olive oil, and Parmesan cheese, all that I had in the house. It was <strong>so</strong> delicious! Mirei told me so at least three times and ate all five small pieces I gave to her, along with broccoli and corn. </p>
<p>After dinner, she did her spelling with Bryn ... ten words, I believe, and she got them all perfect: a, the, she, am, and others I will ask Bryn about. After that she read him about ten pages in "Are You My Mother?" I love her animation as she reads it to him, not to mention the positions she gets into, but reading it word for word, with only two mistakes, despite reading upside down and backwards! </p>
<p>The minute Doug walked in the door tonight, Mirei ran to him, asking him "How was your day, Grandpa?" Doug was sure that I had suggested she ask, but I was as surprised and pleased as he was to hear her ask him. She asked if he would do something with her, so the two of them sat at the table drawing for a little while. </p>
<p>Bryn read her some extra stories just before bedtime, and after one new story from me, this little one was asleep at 7:40.  </p>
