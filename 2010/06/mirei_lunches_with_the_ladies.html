								<h2>Mirei Lunches with "The Ladies"</h2>
								<p>Each Wednesday in Cupertino, Ellen and whatever friends are available meet up for lunch but the regulars seem to be Ellen, Victoria, Angie, and Grace. They're a great group and I joined them last month for the first time in a very long time. Last night Ellen emailed asking if Mirei and I could make it down for this event, and so made plans to do this!</p>
<p>We had lots of time at home though before leaving, so Mirei watched "Caillou" in French while I finished up my shower, she scrambled <strong>two</strong> eggs for her breakfast, and had lots of time for PlayDoh cookies, as well as singing "Happy Birthday" to Auntie Beth along with the rest of us here. </p>
<p>Later on Mirei did the funniest thing while doing her morning drawing... last night Doug had drawn a "bald iggle" for her, a funny little cartoon character he started cppying/drawing when he was a teenager. Mirei liked it a lot, and so this morning she drew one right beside his and then proudly showed it to him. </p>
<p>We left for Ellen's at 10:45 and chatted and sang all the way there. Mirei was anticipating playing with Skippy, Ellen's wee dog, but it turned out that she was happiest watching Ellen toss the ball to Skippy in the yard and in the pool!, and not having to get to close to what she thought looked like too-sharp teeth and nails to her. However, there was a big closet of dress up clothes to go through and Mirei quite liked the looks of the angel wings with high heels! </p>
<p>When it was time to leave for the bakery where we were eating al fresca Ellen told Mirei she could wear the  wings she discovered pretty quickly in that fun closet! </p>
<p>Mirei always says she is shy but it sure doesn't take her long to warm up. She went around the table shaking hands... we practiced a little this morning... and holding hands with Grace, the lovely 92 year old regular. Mirei held court quite easily; everyone was intrigued and delighted with her... with her language skills, her drawing of Victoria, with her sense of humour and her entertainment skills. She kept them all smiling and laughing and coming back for more! It really was such fun watching her interact with each and every one of them on their own. </p>
<p>Victoria said she would like to take her home for two days, and Mirei told her she would come to her house one day, but she couldn't stay for two days because I would be lonely. However, when Angie suggested we could get together for a picnic Mirei piped up with "Everybody could come!" It would be such fun if this happened. </p>
<p>After saying our goodbyes, we stopped in at a market with Ellen all the while pretending to be "the mommy", and Mirei "the baby." Ellen kindly sat in the back seat with Mirei to and from the restaurant and the game continued until we reached Ellen's home. Mirei received a beautiful silver and turquoise bracelet from Ellen, and Victoria gave her a beaded "eye of the god" bracelet that she was wearing! </p>
<p>I asked Mirei not to sleep on the way home (knowing perfectly well that she would), but she promised me she would close her eyes but would talk to me. She didn't. We weren't five minutes from Ellen's before she was sound asleep. That was a fun exciting few hours for her and for all of us too; we said we would be back again soon. </p>
<p>I had promised Mirei this morning that she could paint when we got home and she promptly reminded me of that promise. She did a bright sunny Caillou-coloured painting of a girl with flowers and clouds. Later she drew a sweet picture of Grace with a big smile and lots of hair beside the one she had done of Victoria at the restaurant. </p>
<p>Bath, dessert, and then some quiet time playing with her babies while I rested on her bed for fifteen solid minutes. Then Mirei came in, covered me with a blanket, piled stuffed animals around me and a baby beside me and kissed me. I knew I had to get up then or she really would be tucking me in! </p>
