								<h2><a href="/2010/11/san_francisco_to_sakai_japan_t.html">San Francisco to Sakai to Kyoto!</a></h2>
								<p>My long-awaited flight to Kyoto today was due to leave at 11:40 A.M. How I love these late morning flights, as I always awaken early anyway, and what a treat to have three hours to take care of all the little last-minute packing and details without rushing. I had lots of time to check my emails, answer a few, forward some on to answer there, and pack up my carry-on bag with books ... a novel, a Sudoku puzzle book, and a crossword too, not to mention the chocolate, cheese and buns, some veggies and fruit, and more. </p>
<p>Doug had done a wonderful job packing up the two fully stuffed bags I was checking. They were full of gifts for Christmas and birthdays, plus lots of food for the house and for me: Vermont cheddar cheese, tortellini for Mirei, meat substitutes for me and for the children (they are very fond of Morningstar "bacon", as am I), cornmeal bagels, and a jug of maple syrup too. What Doug couldn't fit in will come with him and Bryn in early December. </p>
<p>My flight left a half hour late, but it gave everyone time to settle in. I had booked a bulkhead seat, but there was a young couple sitting in the aisle seats behind me and I offered to switch seats with him so she could move into the empty seat there and sit together. I didn't mind at all, as he put my large carry-on up top for me, and the young couple sitting next to me, in the middle and window seats, slept for most of the flight. </p>
<p>It was a great trip. Our flight attendant was really wonderfu l... very attentive, friendly, and she even managed to somehow intuit that I really really wanted one of the yummy looking chocolate brownies everyone but the vegetarians got with their lunch ... and brought me two of them, with not a word spoken by me except "thank you!" </p>
<p>When "breakfast" was served I felt comfortable enough with this gal to ask if I could please have one of the regular breakfasts of a veggie omelet, as I never enjoy the overly sweetened hot fruit slices served with an overly sweet pasty substance; I have tried but never have managed to figure out what it is, but it's like pasty cream of wheat but with far too much sugar on it. Makes me shudder to even write about it.  </p>
<p>I often don't enjoy tea on a plane; it's never quite hot enough and usually tastes of the coffee that was in the pot at some point in the past. However, the tea on this trip was perfect and that was a very nice little perq. On a flight of eleven hours and twenty minutes, with me not wanting to sleep too much, this was a treat. </p>
<p>The time passed quickly: I watched two movies, read, dozed, did some puzzles, ate, and before I knew it we were landing in Japan. It always takes longer than I want to get through customs, get my bags, wait for the shuttle, and then the two-plus hour trip to the house. </p>
<p>I was very pleasantly surprised at how mild the night air was when going to the fully loaded shuttle. We started off with nine people but there is a drop off point before reaching the city, where smaller cars take customers to their homes. So, at that point there remained just two of us going right into Kyoto, the other being a young woman who has been living in the States for many many years. We started to chat and it made the rest of the trip go much faster. She is here to visit with her dad on a special occasion birthday in Japan, his 82nd, I believe. It is her second trip "home" this year and she is very happy to be here in Kyoto again, although she now considers the U.S home in that she will always live there. </p>
<p>I had started to recognize some landmarks as we drove to her parent's home, and knew it was only minutes before I would be at the house. It was dark when I arrived, but we travelled through little laneways and along roads that now seem very familiar to me. Both children came right outside once the driver had rung the bell, and here I was ... at last! </p>
<p>In just two and a half months, Mirei has grown taller! and Riku does look older with those big grown-up teeth fully developed. How wonderful to be here again! They both had lots to tell me, and we cuddled on the sofa and read ... Mirei is now reading "Put Me In the Zoo" and knows so many new words!, and I read to Riku before they got tucked into bed. </p>
<p>Big changes there too, as Mirei now sleeps all through the night in her own bed, after having her story read to her downstairs and Riku has the same routine. The new tucking-in bedtime routine now takes less than two minutes! Of course this has been going on for some time now, but it's a big change from last March. They're growing up, and I can't wait to have this next seven weeks with them. </p>
<p>I unpacked all the cold foods that needed freezing or refrigerating and, after pulling out my PJs and kit bag, I zipped up the bags to be unpacked tomorrow. I checked email briefly, posted a message on Facebook that I had arrived safe and sound, and after some time with Akane and Bryn, went to bed at 11 P.M. Thursday Kyoto time (6 A.M. Thursday in San Francisco). </p>
<p>10 and 11th of November</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/11/xxx_my_first_early_morning_vis.html">My First Early Morning Visitor</a></h2>
								<p>Riku joined me in bed this morning, as I had promised last night that he could. He was as warm as could be and snuggled in next to me, with a pack of cards in his hand, to ask me as he flicked through two at a time to choose my favourite one, This wasn't as easy as one would guess, because if I chose the "wrong" one I would hear why the other was better, stronger, or better. I always chose my favourite based on colour anyway, picking out the card with the most silver, or turquoise, gold, or blues. I know it's best that Riku not know this, but it surprised me how often I made the right choice! </p>
<p>Mirei slept in later than Riku so we had just a few minutes together before it was time to get up and get on with our day. It's the usual routine: fruit bowls, then an egg or two, toast, juice, and vitamins, and sitting at the table encouraging food to go in the mouth. Bryn and Akane have this down pat so I slipped away, had my shower, and was ready to walk out the door with Riku at 8 A.M. </p>
<p>Mirei was a little sad that I wasn't going to go on the bus with her, but I promised I would pick her up after school instead. Big hugs and kisses at the door followed by a big wave and many "good-byes!" from the laundry room door at the side of the house.</p>
<p>I so enjoy the walk to school with Riku; it was lovely doing this again and how I like holding his hand as he chatters away happily to me all the way there, filling me on on all sorts of things going on in his life: a caterpillar that wiggled from one side to another when he touched it lightly with a stick, watching a boy on the bridge one day deliberately hurting a tadpole and feeling sad about that, looking forward to his birthday party with two friends, etc.</p>
<p>So many little comments come out that show me who this little boy is, but they follow too quickly, one after another, and I forget too many of them.  I'm happy to be here. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/11/xxxlunch_with_riku.html">Sunday Lunch with Riku</a></h2>
								<p>Akane and Mirei went off to a movie late this morning, and Riku had a very pleasant young Chinese woman Jessica, playing/teaching and speaking to him in Chinese for two hours. </p>
<p>Riku and Mirei had both done their daily spelling list in English earlier, and I thought this might be a good idea for his Chinese sessions too. Just before she left, Riku happily chose ten words he would like to know in Chinese, and write as well, so the next time he sees her, they will work on that list for a bit.Jessica is one of three young university students he sees on quite a regular basis.</p>
<p>Riku is always ready for lunch right at noon, and today, as he did yesterday, asked for a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich, one of his Dad's favourites too. While he ate, at his suggestion, we made a to-do list for him, adding in the things he had already done (I do this too(!), just so he could check them off ... his piano practice, the Chinese session, and his English spelling list of thirty words, all done in no time at all. </p>
<p>Added to his list were two "fun" things ... playtime with Juka, a neighbourhood friend, and some playground time to check out the mud ball we made yesterday and left baking in the sun. Two more chores were added ... reading to me, and writing up his Sunday journal for school tomorrow, plus one more extra Riku decided on ... tidying up his room. Apparently he and Jessica got out a bag of toys that had been put away, and they need to go back where they were in storage. </p>
<p>I suggested we do one work chore, followed by one of the fun items, and another work item, and another fun break. During this time, Riku came up with a very good idea. Last night he had just finished reading "Akimbo and the Baboons" out loud to me, his second time reading of the book over a period of months, so suggested instead of getting right into the next one, that he read a book of his choice, and agreed that it wouldn't be super simple. </p>
<p>So, while he was nibbling on his veggies, he read a wonderful story that was new to me: "Amber Waiting", about a kindergarten child who is always waiting for her dad to pick her up from school. There were some new words in it ... satellite, secretary, corridor, but also wonderful illustrations to look at as well. It was a treat to curl up on the sofa to finish off the last half of it. </p>
<p>Between lunch and the reading, we had started to talk about body parts and what they are really for. We decided we could make a book together, with Riku doing the illustrations and me doing the writing. Here's a sample, but it is still a work in progress. "Cheeks are for kissing, not for pinching. Fingers are for touching, not for bending back. Noses are for smelling, not for picking. Hands are for holding, not for hurting. Feet are for walking, running, and jumping, not for kicking people. Bottoms are for BMs, not for gas" ... although it was agreed that gas is necessary but not in public. "Teeth are for chewing, not for biting. Ears are for listening, not for twisting." There were lots of giggles for other body parts as we went through all the various possibilities, and we agreed we would keep working on it. </p>
<p>Lunch is never dull or boring when dining with Riku. He ran off happily to play with Juka for the rest of the afternoon.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/11/bakingcooking_with_mirei.html">Cooking with Mirei</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei and I have always enjoyed spending time in the kitchen together, so it is lovely to be back with her sharing these moments. Last Saturday, our first weekend day together, Mirei chose to have scrambled eggs, even though she prefers them fried, just so she can cook them herself. Frying eggs is mostly standing back and checking to see when to take the lid off. Not fun.</p>
<p>She hasn't forgotten how to crack and mix an egg, so after carefully pouring the mixture into the frying pan, Mirei stood carefully pushing the egg out from around the edges of the pan to the middle with a spatula, slowly and carefully. They were perfect, and she ate them all up, steaming hot in a bowl, which is how she prefers them served. The toast and "bacon" go on the side. Yesterday was another scrambled egg day, as we only have time for this on the weekends. </p>
<p>During the week I had made French toast, poached eggs, porridge with dried mango and sunflower seeds, and a fried egg, just for variety, saving the scrambled for Mirei to cook up herself. </p>
<p>Today we made pancakes together. When I told Riku he could mix them next Sunday, he responded that he would rather draw than cook! That will make his sister very happy. </p>
<p>Before we start cooking, each and every time, Mirei washes her hands, puts on her apron by herself, and clambers up on the chair at the counter, all set to measure and level and pour and beat. I took photos.  :) </p>
<p>She joined Riku at the table for some drawing time while I cooked up the pancakes, serving them up with warm maple syrup, brought from home, and some sausages that Akane cooked up as a side dish. </p>
<p>We do love our weekend mornings! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/11/xxx_the_neighbourhood.html">"The Neighbourhood!"</a></h2>
								<p>This is my third trip to Kyoto during the past two years, and one of the things I love most about it, besides visiting with the family, of course, is getting to see other familiar faces. I have found most people very friendly, and look forward to seeing them on each return trip. </p>
<p>There is the "snowman lady", the very elderly tiny woman who lives in a big house beside a big garden on our way to the bus stop. I don't see her often, but Mirei and I always peek in her gate to see if we can sepot her. I have only seen her once during this past almost two weeks, and surprisingly, for the first time, it was on the street close to her home and not inside her gate. We did our little bow and greetings. I smiled all the way to the bus stop.</p>
<p>Just around the corner from the house, on our way to school, Riku and I pass by a very friendly woman who often is sweeping and washing her little courtyard at this time of day. She is so very friendly, and seems as pleased to see us as we are her. We've only seen her once this trip. Riku told me he never sees her as he always walks straight down the road from his house, and doesn't take the first left as I like to do. </p>
<p>The first right turn after that takes us past one of the local farmers, who lives right across from one of his huge growing fields. His wife is very friendly, he a little more reserved, and a woman who often is seen working there is quiet and friendly as well. We have seen the farmer himself only once so far, but have seen his wife more often. </p>
<p>I picked Mirei up from school today, and on our walk home from the bus stop, just before "the snowman lady's" house, we both spotted the farmer's wife in another field they plant at that corner. I pointed out to Mirei that she was pulling carrots; we have often read the book "The Carrot Seed" in which the carrot finally is ready to be pulled, and Mirei was delighted to see this for herself. </p>
<p>She called out to the woman in Japanese, carrying on quite a conversation with her. Mirei was asking lots of questions, and getting all the answers too. It soon became obvious that Mirei was being offered some of the crop, and I could see the excitement on her face as she nodded yes.</p>
<p>We met at the edge of the field, and Mirei was presented with three big fat carrots ... the traditional orange one, a "black" one ... more purple actually, but the woman said "black" in English, and a yellow one, all with their long fern-like ends still attached. I am so glad I had my camera with me, as I managed to get several shots of the presentation itself, and of Mirei a little bit further along the road to home, posing proudly with proudly. </p>
<p>A young woman had stopped to watch this carrot exchange take place, and at one point the farmer was trying to say something to her in Japanese, perhaps about cooking methods. (This female farmer... how I wish I knew her name!...was the same one who came to the door last March with a huge bunch of local greens from their garden for me. The year before that, her husband had cut a huge cabbage from his field for me, as I walked home on the way back from Riku's school. I was also presented with a lovely basket of fresh strawberries by her in March as well.) Such generous people! </p>
<p>The young woman walked along with us, and I asked if she was Japanese. ( I was sure she hadn't understood what the farmer's wife was telling her.) Turns out she is from Vietnam, doesn't speak Japanese or French, but her English was quite good. Mirei volunteered that she speaks a little Chinese after hearing me answering the gal's question about what languages Mirei spoke. We had been discussing where I live, where Mirei lives and has lived ... all in two short blocks! I hope we see her again. </p>
<p>Mirei burst into the house, calling in a loud voice to her mom "Come and see what the nice neighbourhood gave me ... carrots!" </p>
<p>Nice neighbourhood indeed! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/11/how_things_change.html">How Things Change!</a></h2>
								<p>April 2009. Riku is attending a new school here in Kyoto and I arrived in time to walk him to school on his first full day. We held hands, kissed goodbye just before arriving at his new classroom, and greet his very friendly, warm principal who stands by the gate saying hello to each child. After school, I met Riku in the courtyard, walking home hand in hand listening to all his stories. </p>
<p>About ten days later, we were still walking to school together and looking forward to greeting some of the local neighbours: a friendly woman, with a big smile, who is often out washing her little courtyard at the same time each day, and a farmer and his wife who live close by as well. We looked for interesting bugs, counted the ladybugs on the plants near the farmer's field, and often sang too. There was lots to see and talk about, and I enjoyed saying good morning to the now-familiar faces at his school. </p>
<p>The first change came when Riku told me I didn't have to meet him at the school for the pick-up, but can wait for him at the crosswalk just before the bridge we cross to get to his school. It was fun watching him from across that river spotting me, giving me a big smile, and walking with the large group of new grade ones, their first year in public school here. We hold hands, sometimes stop at the playground on the way home, and enjoy our much shorter walk to the house. </p>
<p>Three weeks later, Riku was often walking home on his own. Once in a while I went out for a little fresh air and "happened" to bump into him close to home, but mostly I waited for him to come bursting in the door. It waw pretty exciting for him to be walking home by himself! </p>
<p>March 2010: About half way through this month-long visit, Riku says we can just say goodbye at the gate, just up the ramp, so we can kiss goodbye in private. I miss seeing the children skipping in the courtyard but there are lots of children to greet on the long pathway to the school, as well as along the sidewalk alongside the river. Kissing takes place only when there is no one to see us. </p>
<p>November 2010. Happily, I am still walking to school with Riku each day. I so enjoy getting out of the house so early: we leave at 8 A,M. or very close to it, and of course take great delight always in these quiet fifteen minutes with him, after a busy hour plus getting the children organized for their day. We are still greeting our neighbours, although Riku only sees the one woman when I am here, as he doesn't walk that way when he is on his own. And we are still holding hands, unless there is a large group of children behind us.</p>
<p>Riku tells me he is shy and often wants to walk more slowly, allowing the ones behind us to get in front, and then taking my hand again. From day one this trip though is the biggest change of all: no kisses! Well, almost none, as he and his dad have come up with a "secret" kiss: a series of quick hand-squeezes! It works for this boy who is the only one who has anyone ever walking to school with him. </p>
<p>After leaving him well before the gate now, I look back quite often and see Riku waving to me, all the way back up to the sidewalk, until he can no longer see me from the ramp to the playground area. </p>
<p>I have asked him several times if he would like to walk to school on his own, and he always says no, but I have a feeling this won't be the case next year.  :(  So, each and every day I enjoy every moment of this special time with Riku. He's growing up!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/11/tuesday_in_kyoto.html">Tuesday in Kyoto</a></h2>
								<p>Riku slept in late this morning. I was lying waiting for him to join me, but gave up at 6:30 and went off to take my shower. I heard a sad Riku calling to me through the door that he had wanted to snuggle. So, fully dressed, I did so, and then suggested we take my computer to the table for him to play one of the TVOkids games while I prepared his fruit. </p>
<p>Mirei was still sleeping and then enjoying some "relaxing" time in her mom and dad's tatami room. Akane was upstairs with her, so Riku had some time on his own with the game after all  (although he would <strong>much</strong> rather play with someone else).  Maybe tomorrow. </p>
<p>As usual, we did the spelling lists over breakfast and then I read "Tuesday" to them, a story about flying frogs, which they both enjoyed and had lots of comments to make about what was happening on each page. </p>
<p>It was cold in the house again this morning, colder than usual, and Riku and I both wore our gloves on the walk to school too.</p>
<p>I walked fast today and cut off for home one bridge earlier than usual. I was really hungry and looking forward to my egg and toast, followed by a very hot cup of tea.</p>
<p>My thirty minute walk was as pleasant as always; the leaves are falling so quickly now and I stopped to take a photo or two of the few remaining trees still in full colour along the river. </p>
<p>After breakfast I did the dishes up as I always do, and was just fnishing up when Akane walked in from taking Mirei to school. It is sunny out and getting warmer so she got two loads of laundry hung up before leaving to run an errand. </p>
<p>Riku told me this morning that he had a "short" day today, and asked if I would meet him at school after 1:30. I met him on the main sidewalk on the other side of the bridge and even though he was walking with two other boys, he took my hand and walked with me. I heard all about his "kind of scary dream", about frozen caterpillars and dead slugs, but after telling me about it in great detail he decided it was "interesting, not so scary". </p>
<p>We stopped at the playground for ten minutes or so, just long enough for Riku to eat a few of the treats he had decided on at the nearby corner store, and climbed the square iron climbing structure. The topic of conversation the rest of the way home was a current favourite "in one of my rooms in heaven I will have ... " and both children come up with some great themes! </p>
<p>Busy boy once he got home as it was his two-hour session today with one of the Chinese students at 3 P.M. , so he got his piano practicing out of the way, and his math homework too, before "Jimmy" arrived. All of the Chinese students that come here have English names too, so now I know all three. Jimmy was a surprise to Akane, as she always refers to him by his Chinese name.</p>
<p>I was at the French Immersion school at 3:50 to pick up Mirei and, as has become a habit now, she and many other children want to spend "ten minutes!" running around the courtyard, screaming, chasing each other, and gathering together on a little doorstep before running off again. Lots of energy there! We now walk with two of the other moms and their children to the main intersection, and one of them gets the #9 bus with us. Today the bus was not nearly as crowded as usual, so the girls got to sit close to each other, with Mirei sharing her orange, pistachios, and a cheese  stick, much to the delight of the friend's eight-year-old brother. </p>
<p>Riku had a tough time during the forty-five-minute session with Jimmy today. He was resisting doing any more "work!" and at one point came running upstairs crying. I stayed upstairs with Mirei who was practicing her piano while Akane came down to settle things. Ten minutes late, when we were finished, Riku was sitting with Jimmy playing video games on the iPhone, going fifteen minutes past the usual cut-off time. </p>
<p>Mirei had her tub while Akane finished preparing dinner, and we all ate a really yummy meal together. After their dessert of green tea ice cream on a stick, a big favourite right now,  Riku had his tub, finished the last of his regular homework with Akane beside him, I read to Mirei and Riku, and Akane went upstairs to read with Riku ... a nice calm ending to our day with the children.</p>
