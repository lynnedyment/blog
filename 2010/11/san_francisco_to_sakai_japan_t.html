								<h2>San Francisco to Sakai to Kyoto!</h2>
								<p>My long-awaited flight to Kyoto today was due to leave at 11:40 A.M. How I love these late morning flights, as I always awaken early anyway, and what a treat to have three hours to take care of all the little last-minute packing and details without rushing. I had lots of time to check my emails, answer a few, forward some on to answer there, and pack up my carry-on bag with books ... a novel, a Sudoku puzzle book, and a crossword too, not to mention the chocolate, cheese and buns, some veggies and fruit, and more. </p>
<p>Doug had done a wonderful job packing up the two fully stuffed bags I was checking. They were full of gifts for Christmas and birthdays, plus lots of food for the house and for me: Vermont cheddar cheese, tortellini for Mirei, meat substitutes for me and for the children (they are very fond of Morningstar "bacon", as am I), cornmeal bagels, and a jug of maple syrup too. What Doug couldn't fit in will come with him and Bryn in early December. </p>
<p>My flight left a half hour late, but it gave everyone time to settle in. I had booked a bulkhead seat, but there was a young couple sitting in the aisle seats behind me and I offered to switch seats with him so she could move into the empty seat there and sit together. I didn't mind at all, as he put my large carry-on up top for me, and the young couple sitting next to me, in the middle and window seats, slept for most of the flight. </p>
<p>It was a great trip. Our flight attendant was really wonderfu l... very attentive, friendly, and she even managed to somehow intuit that I really really wanted one of the yummy looking chocolate brownies everyone but the vegetarians got with their lunch ... and brought me two of them, with not a word spoken by me except "thank you!" </p>
<p>When "breakfast" was served I felt comfortable enough with this gal to ask if I could please have one of the regular breakfasts of a veggie omelet, as I never enjoy the overly sweetened hot fruit slices served with an overly sweet pasty substance; I have tried but never have managed to figure out what it is, but it's like pasty cream of wheat but with far too much sugar on it. Makes me shudder to even write about it.  </p>
<p>I often don't enjoy tea on a plane; it's never quite hot enough and usually tastes of the coffee that was in the pot at some point in the past. However, the tea on this trip was perfect and that was a very nice little perq. On a flight of eleven hours and twenty minutes, with me not wanting to sleep too much, this was a treat. </p>
<p>The time passed quickly: I watched two movies, read, dozed, did some puzzles, ate, and before I knew it we were landing in Japan. It always takes longer than I want to get through customs, get my bags, wait for the shuttle, and then the two-plus hour trip to the house. </p>
<p>I was very pleasantly surprised at how mild the night air was when going to the fully loaded shuttle. We started off with nine people but there is a drop off point before reaching the city, where smaller cars take customers to their homes. So, at that point there remained just two of us going right into Kyoto, the other being a young woman who has been living in the States for many many years. We started to chat and it made the rest of the trip go much faster. She is here to visit with her dad on a special occasion birthday in Japan, his 82nd, I believe. It is her second trip "home" this year and she is very happy to be here in Kyoto again, although she now considers the U.S home in that she will always live there. </p>
<p>I had started to recognize some landmarks as we drove to her parent's home, and knew it was only minutes before I would be at the house. It was dark when I arrived, but we travelled through little laneways and along roads that now seem very familiar to me. Both children came right outside once the driver had rung the bell, and here I was ... at last! </p>
<p>In just two and a half months, Mirei has grown taller! and Riku does look older with those big grown-up teeth fully developed. How wonderful to be here again! They both had lots to tell me, and we cuddled on the sofa and read ... Mirei is now reading "Put Me In the Zoo" and knows so many new words!, and I read to Riku before they got tucked into bed. </p>
<p>Big changes there too, as Mirei now sleeps all through the night in her own bed, after having her story read to her downstairs and Riku has the same routine. The new tucking-in bedtime routine now takes less than two minutes! Of course this has been going on for some time now, but it's a big change from last March. They're growing up, and I can't wait to have this next seven weeks with them. </p>
<p>I unpacked all the cold foods that needed freezing or refrigerating and, after pulling out my PJs and kit bag, I zipped up the bags to be unpacked tomorrow. I checked email briefly, posted a message on Facebook that I had arrived safe and sound, and after some time with Akane and Bryn, went to bed at 11 P.M. Thursday Kyoto time (6 A.M. Thursday in San Francisco). </p>
