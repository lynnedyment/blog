								<h2>"The Neighbourhood!"</h2>
								<p>This is my third trip to Kyoto during the past two years, and one of the things I love most about it, besides visiting with the family, of course, is getting to see other familiar faces. I have found most people very friendly, and look forward to seeing them on each return trip. </p>
<p>There is the "snowman lady", the very elderly tiny woman who lives in a big house beside a big garden on our way to the bus stop. I don't see her often, but Mirei and I always peek in her gate to see if we can sepot her. I have only seen her once during this past almost two weeks, and surprisingly, for the first time, it was on the street close to her home and not inside her gate. We did our little bow and greetings. I smiled all the way to the bus stop.</p>
<p>Just around the corner from the house, on our way to school, Riku and I pass by a very friendly woman who often is sweeping and washing her little courtyard at this time of day. She is so very friendly, and seems as pleased to see us as we are her. We've only seen her once this trip. Riku told me he never sees her as he always walks straight down the road from his house, and doesn't take the first left as I like to do. </p>
<p>The first right turn after that takes us past one of the local farmers, who lives right across from one of his huge growing fields. His wife is very friendly, he a little more reserved, and a woman who often is seen working there is quiet and friendly as well. We have seen the farmer himself only once so far, but have seen his wife more often. </p>
<p>I picked Mirei up from school today, and on our walk home from the bus stop, just before "the snowman lady's" house, we both spotted the farmer's wife in another field they plant at that corner. I pointed out to Mirei that she was pulling carrots; we have often read the book "The Carrot Seed" in which the carrot finally is ready to be pulled, and Mirei was delighted to see this for herself. </p>
<p>She called out to the woman in Japanese, carrying on quite a conversation with her. Mirei was asking lots of questions, and getting all the answers too. It soon became obvious that Mirei was being offered some of the crop, and I could see the excitement on her face as she nodded yes.</p>
<p>We met at the edge of the field, and Mirei was presented with three big fat carrots ... the traditional orange one, a "black" one ... more purple actually, but the woman said "black" in English, and a yellow one, all with their long fern-like ends still attached. I am so glad I had my camera with me, as I managed to get several shots of the presentation itself, and of Mirei a little bit further along the road to home, posing proudly with proudly. </p>
<p>A young woman had stopped to watch this carrot exchange take place, and at one point the farmer was trying to say something to her in Japanese, perhaps about cooking methods. (This female farmer... how I wish I knew her name!...was the same one who came to the door last March with a huge bunch of local greens from their garden for me. The year before that, her husband had cut a huge cabbage from his field for me, as I walked home on the way back from Riku's school. I was also presented with a lovely basket of fresh strawberries by her in March as well.) Such generous people! </p>
<p>The young woman walked along with us, and I asked if she was Japanese. ( I was sure she hadn't understood what the farmer's wife was telling her.) Turns out she is from Vietnam, doesn't speak Japanese or French, but her English was quite good. Mirei volunteered that she speaks a little Chinese after hearing me answering the gal's question about what languages Mirei spoke. We had been discussing where I live, where Mirei lives and has lived ... all in two short blocks! I hope we see her again. </p>
<p>Mirei burst into the house, calling in a loud voice to her mom "Come and see what the nice neighbourhood gave me ... carrots!" </p>
<p>Nice neighbourhood indeed! </p>
