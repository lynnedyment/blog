								<h2>Mirei Out and About Today</h2>
								<p>This was an unusual day for us, as Mirei had a breakfast date with Mari and Bryn, so set off at 7:45 for breakfast at "Just for You" again, making it two Sundays in a row! Mirei helped me pack up a bag to take along with a sweater, her water bottle, plus her drawing pad, pencils, and some grapes. I expected that they would be back after some time at the playground after they ate, but plans have a way of changing. </p>
<p>All three went to a playground near Susan's, and when Mari had to leave, Bryn and Mirei dropped in to say hello. Finn was off at his swimming lesson, so Amelia and Mirei had some time together to play. I'm sure Mirei was thrilled to bits to be there with all the toys in Amelia's room. </p>
<p>Later Amelia went off for a playdate with another friend, so Susan, Bryn, Mirei, and Finn went to the beach at Pacifica. It was quite foggy here in the city this morning but it is often clear further south of us. Mirei had lots of fun playing with Finn, although when she came in she showed me how she had cut the bottom of her foot a bit when she was climbing on a pointy rock. </p>
<p>They all went off to have Mexican food for lunch; Mirei had a quesadilla as well as good tortilla chips, Bryn reported, with guacamole, and a lime Fresca. I know Finn likes quesadillas too, so it was a perfect spot for their lunch. </p>
<p>I had planned to go to a double feature movie with Doug today, from 11-6ish but knew that after my long day and late evening yesterday I would be snoring away during one or both of the films. So I opted for four hours on my own to get some cooking done. The fridge is packed with food and it was time to get some of it cleared out. </p>
<p>In all I was very productive: changed Mirei's bedding, made a double batch of mushroom risotto, and now have enough in the freezer for seven more single meals, baked up a batch of applesauce muffins, using our homemade applesauce, and then bagged up the rest of it for future muffins and/ cakes. I cleared away lots of dishes while talking to a good friend in Idaho ... gotta love those headphones so that I could move around and still catch up on our lives! I called Neal in Niagara Falls and had a long chat with him too. Made up zucchini pancakes, using a recipe from Tay in Twin Falls, and dinner rolls from a recipe given to me by a casual new friend south of the city. Put together a caprese salad too, using fresh basil from the pot outside the back door.  Oh, and I cleaned out two of the kitchen drawers too, while chatting on the phone, and that was well worth doing... funny how these little things make a difference. </p>
<p>About 3 P.M. Bryn and Mirei came home. Mirei had two drawings in her hand, and gave them to me saying they that were for me! Her dad thought differently as she had told them they were for him when she drew them. It's hard to choose just whom to donate precious art work to apparently. Mirei tries hard to make everyone happy ... and does so.  Once up the stairs, I got both versions of how they had spent their time together. </p>
<p>Mirei occupied herself with her babies, but had asked if we could watch more of the Peter Rabbit DVD that Doug chose for her at the library the other day. I had to have dinner on the table at 5:30 tonight, as Bryn and Doug were going to a concert, so Mirei happily went up the stairs with Grandpa to watch the movie until bath time. </p>
<p>There was time for a fishing game with a magnetic board and rod that Candy and Rick gave to Riku when he was a little guy. Mirei likes it every bit as much as he did. </p>
<p>Quick tub tonight, as dinner was right on time. Everyone enjoyed it; Mirei commented that she remembered the mushroom risotto and liked it, we all liked the veggie pancakes a lot, the rolls were delicious, and of course the adults all liked the caprese. Bryn asked Mirei to have just one small portion of tomatoes, but she objected, saying that she didn't like tomatoes. He urged her to have just one bite and I suggested that she could follow it immediately with some food she did like. Doug and Bryn had left the table just after Mirei leaned over and in a loud whisper said she wouldn't have a bite, but "Shhhhh, it's a secret". Well, she took the bite and them immediately took four more pieces of tomato from the bowl, and polished off six more pieces at the very end of her meal. I think the only food Mirei just does not like is bananas. </p>
<p>Doug and Bryn were off to a concert in Berkeley and left the house at 6 o'clock. Mirei and I sat and finished our dinners, she did a drawing with more bits of cotton batting on it, she read to me in the living room from "Are You My Mother?" and rubbed my back for me too, as all the standing in one spot today had me pretty sore. I somehow never did find time for a hot cuppa with my feet up, and by the time Mirei was tucked into bed and the rest of the kitchen clean and tidy it was too late for tea. I did sit, though, and eat a banana and read through a magazine. </p>
<p>It's early to bed for me tonight, and the emails I should have answered are going to wait for another day. It was a most productive day and now I need to "recharge" as Bryn says! </p>
