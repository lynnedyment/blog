								<h2>Little Moments</h2>
								<p>Pancakes: When Kelly and Bryn were living at home we made pancakes often, using our favourite recipe made with yogurt substituted for almost half the milk, at some point switching to vanilla yogurt. For whatever reason, I haven't made them nearly often enough for Riku and Mirei, so we're going to change that this summer, and make Sundays pancake days. Mirei is my very willing little baking helper and can scoop up and level off that flour, crack and separate the eggs, and mix up a storm like the experts! </p>
<p>Eggs: They're a favourite breakfast food for both Riku and Mirei and usually they have them every other day, in one form or another, with oatmeal on the in-between days. Mirei likes to decide how they will be cooked. "What is scrambled? Oh yes, when the yellow and white are mixed together." or "Fried? What is fried? Oh yes, a dippy egg." Today for the first time she slid her own egg into the frying pan, and checked twice, lifting the lid carefully, to see if it was "just right!". The egg was served today, along with toast and "bacon" as her brunchy meal before going on to a... </p>
<p>Picnic! Yes, Mirei went to a second picnic in a row today, once more with her dad, and joining up with Auntie Susan, Kevin, Amelia, and Finn and other friends of theirs. Mirei was all primed to go, and once we had the right top on (we decided she had better wear a sleeveless top) kept calling to Bryn "Let's go Daddy! I'm all ready!" There will be many many more picnics this summer for certain. </p>
<p>Drawing: Red letter day today! Mirei drew lots of flowers, and a house beside some giant flowers, but tonight she decided to draw a man and a woman getting married (we had watched a Japanese movie called "The Cat Returns" which had a subplot of a wedding) <strong>and</strong> she drew bodies on them both, rather than stick figures for the trunk, arms, and legs. She seems to have bypassed the nipple, belly button phase though as her people are always dressed. </p>
<p>Spelling: Sometime after I left Japan in March, Bryn started "spelling homework" with Mirei. She is always keen to do what Riku does and so reads each day and does her spelling list with no fuss at all. He has a standard list... a, the, on, she, he, yes, no, you, I, and to. While sitting in the car with me the other day we wrote out "boo, coo, moo, loo, zoo" and so now I get to add those to the list when she finishes off with Bryn's. Yesterday Bryn explained the difference between too and to to her as well, and now she has that down pat. It's lots of fun listening to her rhyme them off, sometimes using a singsong voice, sometimes being perfectly silly and deliberately misspelling them just to hear Bryn protest, I'm sure, but always getting them right. I think she's ready to move on. </p>
<p>Little bits... tonight I videotaped Mirei and Doug using a fake language, something I started with Riku when he was Mirei's age. It is such fun to watch and hear her doing this, as she can keep it up for the longest time, sounding perfectly serious and involved with the pretend dialogue with lots of animation involved too! She and I walked several blocks home from the playground the day she arrived chatting away in ourspeak! </p>
<p>Happy 4th! Fireworks and noisemakers are going off as I type this! </p>
