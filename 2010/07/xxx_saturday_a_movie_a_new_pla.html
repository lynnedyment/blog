								<h2> Saturday: a Movie, a new Playground, and an Evening with Amelia, Finn, and Max</h2>
								<p>Yesterday seemed to disappear in a flash! Bryn was home with us all morning, which made a big difference, as Mirei had three adults around to entertain. Bryn read and sang through the "Baby Beluga" book with her, and she and Doug had more fun with their pretend "foreign language" game. </p>
<p>She and  sat quietly at the table with Mirei drawing two new pictures for me. Riku now is wearing pants in these drawings and has hair too, and Mirei now writes my name and hers on top with a heart in between. I am <strong>so</strong> lucky! </p>
<p>Mirei ate her egg "all by myself" and is practicing using a big grown-up knife to "cut it properly, like this, see Nana."... using the knife in her right hand and her fork facing down on the left. The highlight of breakfast though was Auntie Beth's grape jam. Mirei often mentions grape as a favourite flavour and did she ever like this jam! </p>
<p>Doug had free passes for us to go to see "Chicken Run" this afternoon at 2, as part of the film festival he has a week long pass to, as well as doing some volunteer work for it. So, off we went with a bag full on snacks and money from Bryn for popcorn too. Mirei was the <strong>only</strong> child in the entire theatre and so got lots of attention from the five women volunteers there. One woman in particular, a British woman, seemed to appeal to her especially, as Mirei voluntarily hugged her several times, and made sure she gave her another before we left after the show too. </p>
<p>She also got to meet Ruth Stein, one of our local film critics. When she introduced the movie to us, as part of her festival duties, she pointed to Mirei and said that she knew she was especially going to enjoy it. </p>
<p>I believe there were fewer than a dozen people in the entire theatre, so Doug took Mirei up on stage before the movie, and she got to see the thousands of little holes in the screen where, as she told me later, "because there is a person back there singing and that is where the music comes out!". The theatre was chilly, so Mirei snuggled up on Grandpa's lap, ate, and whispered a few questions to us occasionally. She was quite fascinated with most of it... the poor chickens who were going to get turned into pies, the mean woman, the plane they escaped on, and the mean woman getting her just desserts too. </p>
<p>It was time for some running around, and Doug suggested "Amelia and Finn's playground" near their old house. It was the perfect choice as Mirei had such fun sitting on a platform while Doug rolled her along a track, a long and high swing-time ("high as a bird in the sky, high as a plane in the sky, high as Superman... ") When I said "high as Ultraman!" Mirei informed me that Ultraman doesn't fly. Oops! There is a new piece of equipment there now, a stepped climbing and balancing piece, and even though Mirei was a little nervous at winding her way up to the highest part the first time, she ran over to get Doug so he could see her do it too. </p>
<p>We were there for an hour and a half but still Mirei was so reluctant to leave the little boy she had met and was being so sweet and attentive to. He was almost two but was tiny, and she took such great delight in tending to him, tossing a ball up to him, running to get it back after he tossed it down the slide, and giving him lots of gentle hugs. She kept calling him "sweetie" which his mother found so endearing.. and it was. </p>
<p>I had an hour and fifteen minutes after getting home to get a fast dinner on the table, get cleared up, and head out the door to Susan's and Kevin's for an evening there with the children. Thank goodness Mirei suggested tortellini, as it was fast, and with a simple salad along with it, took no time to get it ready. I sat with Mirei as she finished up her dinner, so had that bit of quiet time with her before leaving. I was not prepared for her bursting into tears as I said goodbye to her though, and it was hard for me to leave her. I know perfectly well that Bryn no doubt had her laughing before the car pulled out of the driveway, but she cries so rarely that it is tough for me to take. </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin were not ready to dash out the door when I got there, so Finn and I played with blocks and a ball in his room while Amelia and Max were in the tub. The "big kids" kept themselves busy after Susan and Kevin left at 7:15, and since Finn was hungry, I heated up some pizza for him and we sat at the table chatting on our own, sharing a bowl of carrots too. </p>
<p>Susan had ordered pizza, salad, and cheesecake for us all, but I had eaten a bowl of tabbouleh at home, so we all had some pizza, shared one piece of cheesecake, and had a nice time just talking at the table about the summer camps that Amelia and Max have attended together. Finn showed me some of the things he had done at his Montessori play group too and told me how they spend their days... no gardening, not too much walking, but playing inside and outside.</p>
<p>While I was clearing up after dinner, the three children got busy making pillows. Amelia had asked if they could use old cloths and pins, so I was very surprised when I discovered there was lots of tape and kleenex tissue used in the process as well! They were all sitting on the big bed though for the longest time, having fun and ending up with very nice soft pillows. Amelia decided that hers was so soft, filled and covered as it was with so very <strong>many</strong> tissues, that she would put hers under her regular pillow so that she could show it to her parents in the morning. </p>
<p>Amelia chose a book for bedtime that I had given her a couple of years ago called "Trust Me Mom". We all snuggled up on the big bed, and they all really liked the story, Finn so much so that he asked if we could read it as his own story in his room. I turned out the light for Amelia and Max at 9:15, and then we did that. After we finished it, but with lots of comments in between too, he reminded me where his night light went, to turn on his sound machine, and then snuggled right up next to me, with his feet between my calves. I slowly extricated myself  bit by bit, as he was yawning away and was asleep within seven minutes I'm sure. I stayed in with him for perhaps fifteen minutes more, making sure he was in a nice deep sleep.</p>
<p>I was sitting in the living room finishing the last page of my book when Doug came in after watching a movie at the festival, and we sat chatting until Susan and Kevin came in at 11:15 from a 40th birthday celebration. They had lots of fun, which was good to hear, as they don't get out together often enough. </p>
<p>Bedtime, after a quick check of emails, just after midnight. Yawn! </p>
