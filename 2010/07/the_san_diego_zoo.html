								<h2>The San Diego Zoo</h2>
								<p>The children had hoped they could swim this morning, but Bryn and Doug both thought it best just to pack up and leave asap for the zoo. The earlier we can get there, the sooner we can leave on our long trip home this evening. </p>
<p>Bryn had looked on the Internet for a breakfast spot not too far away, and came up with a winner. "Lucky's" it was, a one-man-run diner with Lucky taking the orders, cooking up the food, cutting the pancakes into small bites for the children(!), serving it, urging the children to finish what was on their plates, passing the leftovers over to Grandpa and Dad, cleaning the counters, and taking the cash too. We were impressed for sure, and the food was typical diner breakfast food, but at a much lower price than usual. The children sat drawing at the counter while waiting for their breakfast. </p>
<p>On the way to the zoo, we sang all the songs on our tape, always singing "Baby Beluga" with gusto, and with everyone joining it too. The children love us to sing together, and we do quite well with most of the other songs now, as we have heard them so often. </p>
<p>This zoo was wonderful, my first trip there ever. We tried to go once when Kelly and Bryn were youngsters, but it just poured the entire time we spent in southern L.A. that year ... and it was the year the song "It Never Rains in Southern California" by Albert Hammond, was popular too. I remember oh-so-well singing it all the way down and back in the car. </p>
<p>The children both enjoy carrying a map and plotting out their moves, so Riku suggested we go to the reptile house first. He was very taken with the massive boa constrictor, and weeks later Mirei still remembered, and demonstrated, how they give you such big hugs that they crush you. </p>
<p>We didn't see half the zoo, but we did take our time and enjoy all that we did see. Doug was thrilled to see a huge tank with a massive hippopotamus, up close, very close! It's the best view he has ever had of these massive creatures and the children crowded in to see him move around too. They were quite taken with the large sculpture of a hippo too and waited for their chance to climb on it, and play for as long as we were willing to sit there. </p>
<p>I have a fondness for elephants, and toward the end of our time there, we came to the huge area devoted to twelve elephants, both Asian and African, and all just beautiful. We saw giraffes and condors, and massive tortoises too. It's a grand zoo and I would jump at the chance to go again. </p>
<p>The weather was changing from hot to cool all throughout the day, but that was preferable to the searing heat we might have had. I think we lucked out with the weather on this trip, as only Disneyland was a little hotter than we would have preferred. </p>
<p>Before leaving about 5 P.M. the children got to choose a small toy from the gift shop and they both chose lizards. These proved to be very entertaining for part of the trip home, as Mirei babied hers, when it wasn't battling with Riku's. However, once again, the children proved to be such troopers at sitting in the car for eight plus hours. We stopped once for Mirei to go to the bathroom and twice for gas. </p>
<p>We ate dinner in the car again, to get us home faster, and we had snacks along with us too: shortbread cookies, a bit of fruit, and nibblies ... cheese sticks, a few crackers, and lots of cold water as well. </p>
<p>Mirei entertained us by singing "Up the tall white candlestick went little Mousie Brown", with such flair and emphasis on "But Mother was in town!" that she made us laugh out loud more than once. Riku encouraged us in telling bits of ghost stories, one of his favourite ways to pass the time, although Mirei's bits tended to be very long and detailed and he had to cut her short sometimes. </p>
<p>They had had a busy few days, and not as much sleep as usual, so I fully expected them both to be asleep very soon after starting out. Riku gave in first, about 8 o'clock but Mirei held out until after 9, chattering away to herself and her reptile babies or to us. Finally that little head dropped and she was out like a light, all the way to San Francisco, finally landing in at home at 1 A.M. </p>
<p>I didn't sleep at all, much to my surprise, and Bryn carried the children upstairs and tucked them right into bed together. The children slept right through their move from the car to the bed except for  just a few minutes during the transfer. I got a peek of them snuggled up beside each other before I headed up.</p>
<p>I stayed up to wind down a bit, checking my emails and responding to a couple of them. Bed at 2 A.M. for me with plans for a much earlier to bedtime tonight!</p>
