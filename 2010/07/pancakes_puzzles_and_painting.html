								<h2>Pets, and a Playground!</h2>
								<p>Bryn and Riku were up and ready for their two-hour drive to Sacramento about 7:30 this morning. Bryn planned to stop at McDonald's for a rare breakfast as they drove; they will be meeting up with Susan, Kevin, Amelia, and Finn for a long day at the fair. I packed up enough fruit and veggies in a cooler to last Riku for two days, along with a few snacks too for the car trip and in the hotel tonight. Surprisingly, Mirei was fine with letting them go off without her, but I had promised we would have fun here today. </p>
<p>And we did.We had a splendid day, started off by a long long "let's cuddle!" suggestion by Miss Mirei. Unlike Kelly's Bryn, Caillie, and Riku, all of whom always wanted to be read a big stack of books in the morning in bed, Mirei prefers to talk ... about what we are going to do today, what we might do tomorrow, and going over some of the things that happened yesterday. I get lots of hugs around the neck, lots of attention if I need some ... she is <strong>very</strong> good at finding the pressure points in my face when my sinuses are bad, or rubbing any sore spot she thinks I might have. I get an extra blanket and an animal too, and then we get to "talk" animal talk together, as she always gathers one in for herself too. </p>
<p>After lunch she and I headed out on the bus to a playground at the top of Noe Valley. I hadn't been there for years, but I spotted a pet store on the opposite corner as we got off the bus, so we went in to check it out. There was a big friendly dog to get past first; Mirei loves the idea of dogs, and is fine petting their back ends, but she is very nervous about their teeth and tongue being too close to her. Once we were at the back of the store, she was just thrilled with all the birds in large cages: lovebirds, parrots, finches, and others. We spent at least a half hour while she checked them all out, and then checked them out again. She now does a great imitation of a parrot moving up and down! </p>
<p>The playground at the corner of 24th and Diamond has been completely redone since I was last there with Bryn and Caillie ... many years ago! They have the soft cushiony padding down, a large curving sandbox, and a great little climbing set, more for the younger children, rather than Riku's age group. There are also some climb-on toys and a see-saw, so enough to keep Mirei happy for a good two hours, especially with all the darling young babies and children around! We met ten-month-old Noah and his dad, Andy, then a little girl named Nova, and after that a darling little boy called Cooper, who it turned out is a neighbour of Noah's! All the parents were totally smitten with Mirei and her motherly ways with their little ones. Mirei is sweet and affectionate with them, and they smile and smile at her ... as she does them. Mirei insists she is not going to have a baby "because it hurts too much", but I hope she ends up with at least four of them! What a great mom she is going to be! </p>
<p>Mirei asked for a "treat" before leaving Noe Valley, so I bought her a little tub of Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream which she ate on the bus on the way home. There was a friendly woman standing behind us on the crowded bus, and she engaged Mirei in quite a conversation, talking about how pretty Mirei was, and about her own little granddaughter too. Mirei is quite happy to chat with strangers, although can be shy in some situations. </p>
<p>When we were on the bus on the way to the playground, I thought I had left my camera at home, but the more I thought about it the more I convinced myself that I <strong>had</strong> put it in my purse. But as the time went on, I somehow believed that it had fallen out when the snack pack I was carrying fell on the floor of the bus. I was so upset to not only lose the camera, but also to miss out on all the great shots of Mirei with the little ones today. Sure enough, when I got home it was not where I thought I might have left it, and I phoned the bus office to report it missing.</p>
<p>We read a nice stack of books tonight at the table while Mirei was eating her dinner. It was a nice treat as we don't often do this, and certainly never this many.  </p>
<p>As I was reading to Mirei in bed, Doug opened the bedroom door, much to my surprise (it's not something he would normally do), to let me know that he had found my camera ... in my purse! It had just worked down into the corner of my almost empty bag and I just hadn't felt around for it long enough. Whew! Doug had been thinking about how hard it would be for the camera to fall out if it, as the way the purse is designed would make that difficult for sure. </p>
<p>First I felt relief, of course, but I was also sad that I had missed all the afternoon shots out with Mirei. But, what would I have done if I had lost it??? Lucky me! </p>
