								<h2>San Francisco to L.A.!</h2>
								<p>Busy morning for everyone today. Akane was packing up to leave for Japan, I was putting together all the items from my long list of clothes and snack foods, Bryn organized his small bag and drove Akane to the BART station, and Doug worked on the last set of photos for me before he too got packing and filled the two cold containers for the car. Riku did a last set of homework with his Mom, and Mirei kept herself busy and happy. </p>
<p>We left the house at 10:15 A.M., and headed south. It took us exactly eight hours to arrive in our hotel. The children were wonderful in the car. We sang songs, chatted, pointed out interesting things to each other that we saw from the car windows, and I read some stories to them both, individually and together. </p>
<p>Riku nodded off for two hours, and Mirei held off until after 1 P.M. I think she really enjoyed her captive audience as she certainly kept us entertained and laughing all the way. The children like snacks, and I had packed lots of healthy ones, so at lunch we merely stopped at a Taco Bell for takeaway burritos, which the children really enjoyed. </p>
<p>It was hot outside and we had the AC on the entire time, once we got out of the Bay area. This also meant it was quieter in the car, and so reading and singing was easier too. </p>
<p>I was sitting between the two children, with Riku in a booster, to get him up higher, and Mirei in her regular car seat. I was sure this was going to be a very uncomfortable drive, but I was just fine. </p>
<p>Riku does not enjoy long car trips, and before we go anywhere he always asks how long it will take. I was concerned that he might get car sick or just hate being confined for so long, but other than ask once an hour or so how many hours we still had to go, he was a great little traveller. </p>
<p>We were booked into the same hotel where Bryn and Riku stayed a few years ago. It was perfect, with a swimming pool just down from our room. We had hoped to go swimming that first night but after settling in, but we were all hungry and knew it would be too late for the children once we had eaten. We did promise that we would go swimming in the morning before leaving for Disneyland, and that was fine with them. They were excited about being in a hotel and having us all together in one room. </p>
<p>After checking the menu in our room, Bryn and Doug decided that we would have dinner in the hotel ... a wonderful selection of many dishes, all tasty, which we shared among us all. On the way to the restaurant, Riku made us all laugh with a new walk he has come up with: a very fey model's strut, with his hips and shoulders tight, and tiny mincing steps. He moves his shoulders stiffly while walking and it's hilarious. </p>
<p>At the restaurant, while waiting for the food to arrive, the children kept busy drawing, as they always do. We had a long, slow, and very enjoyable meal.  </p>
<p>The children had some time to read before they got into bed for their nighttime story. Bryn had some work to do, so left to sit in an office space around the corner. Doug joined him too, taking along his book, until the children were asleep. It was a long day, but a very good one from beginning to end. </p>
