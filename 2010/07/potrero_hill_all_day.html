								<h2>A Day on Potrero Hill</h2>
								<p>Doug had three movies to attend today, so we ran off early to do a couple of errands, and then the car was free for him. That left Mirei and I on the hill for the day, and we had no trouble at all filling in the hours.</p>
<p>We had planned last night to make date squares together, and Mirei doesn't forget such things, ever! But first we watched the last segment of a Peter Rabbit DVD that Doug had picked up from the library for her, and it was just delightful. I always join Mirei for the last half of it, after I've showered, as she loves having someone to tell all about it. While eating our fruit plates later in the morning than is usual, Mirei wrote her letter to Victoria, as she had promised yesterday that she would, and then it was time for those squares! </p>
<p>One day I hope to make personal cookbooks for all the children, as I have many many photos of them all baking various goodies. Of course, even with an enthusiastic little helper, this makes the process even longer than it would otherwise, and Mirei makes sure that I remember to take photos of each step! She put the dates in a big pot, after we had both tasted one date each ... and once again Mirei was just fine with trying something new, and liked it too. While they cooked and softened, we mixed up the oatmeal, flour, sugar, and soda mixture, with Mirei doing every single step of it. </p>
<p>Mirei measured out the crumb mixture in half, patted down the base, spread the dates on that, and sprinkled the rest of the crumbs evenly over the top of it all, pressing that down more gently, at my suggestion. </p>
<p>While they were baking, we stopped for lunch. Mirei decided she wanted to help make her grilled cheese sandwich too, so she carefully spread the butter on both slices of bread, and helped me use the cheese plane for the cheddar. This sandwich is a big hit always, and she ate if all up quickly. </p>
<p>I had started gathering the ingredients together to make up a batch of cheese bread dough, and Mirei was fast enough eating her lunch that she was there to do it with me right from the beginning. How she loves sticking her nose right down close to whatever she's making and then telling me how it smells. The oatmeal mixture got a big thumbs up but she wasn't crazy about the yeasty odour. I like it a lot, but perhaps she will get used to it. We'll make lots of bread this summer. </p>
<p>Mirei drew in the living room, flat down on her tummy, while I washed up all the bowls and pans we had used for our cooking. I was ready to sit down with a cup of tea, but Mirei was anxious to get to the playground several blocks away, so off we went. We have a very friendly neighbour just two doors down from us, and he was out when we passed by his house. Mirei ran up to him with a cheery "Hello Ralph!" and he greeted her just as warmly. They have been chatting since she was old enough to say "hi", and today Mirei told him her brother and her mother were coming in just two more days. She told him her mother speaks Japanese and a little bit of English, but when Ralph asked her if she helped her mommy learn more English, she replied that Mommy already did know lots of English already. As we continued down the block, Mirei turned back and called out "Goodbye Uncle Frank! See you soon!" I wrote to Uncle Frank to tell him he was on both our minds today. </p>
<p>The playground was the perfect place to end this afternoon. It was warm and sunny and there was a good group of children there, including lots of little ones that Mirei was very protective of, making sure that they did not get hurt. She and I tossed a ball back and forth, she ran up and down the big and smaller slides, we tossed the ball up and down the big one, and Mirei climbed to the top of the big rope structure, assuring me she was fine and telling another woman it was okay if her little boy pushed it while she was climbing. Mirei is gaining lots of confidence, and worked her way through a narrow rope column at the top too, holding on tightly but placing her feet carefully too. </p>
<p>We left at 4:30, enjoying our walk home, as Mirei always has lots to chat about. We sing sometimes too. Earlier today she had talked to Caillie, Myk', and Auntie Kelly on the phone. Caillie had told her that Myk' was her step-sister and Mirei knows all about mean step-sisters from Cinderella. Now she knows that just some step-sisters are mean. Kelly had sung her the song about lemon drops and gumdrops, so we walked part of the way with our tongues sticking out to catch the "rain".</p>
<p>Tub, dinner, three stories at the table, with a tiny date square as part of her dessert. Mirei said "I <strong>like</strong> date squares and I will make them for my children too!"</p>
<p>Mirei was sound asleep at 7:25 tonight, anticipating her visit to Cupertino tomorrow with not just Ellen, Grace, Angie, and Victoria, but Victoria's mom too ("but what about Victoria's dad?"), and perhaps Angie's daughter as well. Mirei did say on the way home that "Grace is a nice girl and pretty too. She has pretty pink lipstick." Grace is 92 and I know she will be thrilled to hear this comment tomorrow! </p>
