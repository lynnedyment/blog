								<h2>Home Again and Franklin Square</h2>
								<p>Riku was the first one awake this morning, asking his dad's permission to get to work on his new Lego set. By the time I came down he was well entrenched at the kitchen table, with all the various parts in the small plastic food storage containers, and well on his way to having it take shape. Mirei and Bryn slept in longer, and Mirei was fast to join Riku at the table to admire what he had done. He was very patient with her, pointing out how he had to follow the instructions, and letting her help find the pieces. </p>
<p>He worked away at it non-stop and was very proud showing it off to Bryn and his Grandpa; Bryn was amazed at how quickly he finished it and Doug was amazed at how complicated it was, with Riku doing it all on his own, with no help at all except for pulling apart or sticking together some of the tiniest tightest pieces. </p>
<p>For some reason the song "Lollipop", which Bryn had played for the children in Japan in March, came up this morning. Doug put the song on the computer and had both children join him, teaching them how to do the "pop". It was pretty cute to see, and Riku got it down pretty quickly; Mirei was giving it her best shot and got some pointers from her dad later on. </p>
<p>We had a slow easy morning at home, with a long stretched-out breakfast, and lots of down time. Mid-afternoon we decided to go to Franklin Square, a playground very close to us, and the children had a great time playing together and with some of the other children there. Mirei met a darling little girl, and while they played together, the mom and I had a nice chat. Mirei always remembers these children and wonders if she will see them the next time we are there. It always astounds me that almost always she remembers their names too, sometimes weeks later! </p>
<p>We were all quite tired after our long day yesterday and so it was an early night for baths before dinner, and bedtime not that much later. Of course we had time for stories first, although I could tell both children were ready to snuggle in for a good long sleep. </p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, early, Bryn and Riku are off to the State Fair in Sacramento, leaving Mirei home for some quiet alone time here in San Francisco. </p>
