								<h2>Baker Beach and A Girl's Night at Home</h2>
								<p>I slept until 7:15 this morning, not waking until Mirei crawled in on Doug's side of the bed (he was up already) and lay there quietly until I was aware of her warm body and cold feet. </p>
<p>We had plans to go to the beach today, although the fog hung over Twin Peaks so long that I was sure we wouldn't be able to go. That gave Mirei lots of time to put together all of the puzzles that I have owned since I was babysitting friends' children back in the mid-seventies. They are really sweet board puzzles, with darling drawings of siblings, a mailman, and a policeman, although about four pieces have gone missing. Mirei, to my surprise, was able to do them easily, as she finished up the first one so quickly when I was doing up the dishes. I joined her for the rest of them, and we took turns with one of them with each doing one piece at a time. </p>
<p>Mirei also finished writing her letter to Ellen, with a drawing of lots of flowers (and ants!) on the inside of the card too. We had lunch at home, as the fog was still pretty heavy, and by the time I packed up our "picnic", a snack really, it was nice and sunny over here ... but still not looking promising over town. Mirei really wanted to go, though, and wasn't tempted to go to a local playground as I suggested instead. </p>
<p>Baker Beach it was! We both had to put on our jackets, and Mirei a sweater as well. However, once we were seated on our warm blanket, the sand heated up and she was delighted to sit there making "ice cream" with two pails and a shovel. I had my choice among grape, vanilla, strawberry, coconut, and a mix, but I could not, for some reason, mix coconut and vanilla. </p>
<p>Mirei spotted a red balloon tied with a long ribbon on it, so ran off to get it, having me tie it to her wrist. What a great time she had with it. There wasn't much wind so mostly it bounced along beside her, but also got wrapped around her, so there was much twisting and turning involved too. I took <strong>so</strong> many photos of her! We went for a walk as well, but Mirei was too cold on the wet part of the sand, so after a little incident with a too friendly puppy wanting to play with her, we went back to our blanket. </p>
<p>We had hoped to stop in at the Potrero Hill library on the way home, but it was closed, so no princess books today. Mirei had decided she wanted pizza for dinner, though, so we picked up two small ready-made cornmeal crusts and home we came. Mirei popped right into the tub for a long play with her pots and pans, while I made up the potato salad that I had started in the morning, and got the pizza in the oven too. We had such a good dinner together, just the two of us,since Doug had left for a movie by the time we got home and Bryn was at work in the valley still. She took great delight in being allowed to scooping out her own ice cream for dessert tonight, and I was impressed by the small portion she took and then handed the spoon back to me. </p>
<p>I made my daily cup of tea and sat on the sofa while Mirei did her reading. She was <strong>too</strong> funny, deliberately skipping pages while pretending to just be reading as usual. Her giggles gave her away and I let her get away with it, just raising my eyebrows each time to let her know I was on to her. I did some recording and hope that it turned out well. Such fun! </p>
<p>"Dr. Dyment" got out her kit while I finished up my tea, and checked me out thoroughly ... blood pressure, heart beat, throat, knee reflex, needle, etc. but there was a bonus too ... I got my hair combed at the end of it, and was even handed a mirror so I could check out my new "do(!)" Wow! While I finished up the dinner dishes, Mirei combed her own hair too, checking herself out in the little mirror Susan gave to me for a give-away a few weeks ago. It is the perfect addition to Mirei's doctor kit. </p>
<p>At 6:45 Mirei asked if it was story time yet, and at 7:20 I left a little girl sleeping soundly. I'm off to bed before 11 for the second night in a row.</p>
