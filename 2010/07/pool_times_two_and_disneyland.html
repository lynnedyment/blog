								<h2>Morning Pool Time, Disneyland, and an Evening Swim Too!</h2>
								<p>The minute the children awoke this morning, just before 7 A.M., they asked about going swimming. They were into their suits lickety split. Mirei's was pink, of course, and she had pink goggles too, but decided not to wear them as they were too tight. They had a little fruit first, in their suits, while I got ready. Even though it was the last thing I wanted to do this early, off I went with the children. That water, this early in the day, was <strong>cold</strong>, but of course once we all got in, it was just fine. Bryn joined us about ten minutes later, and it was fun for the children to see him shivering while slowly getting in, reassuring him that it was <strong>warm</strong>. I had forgotten to take my camera along, so have no photos of this early morning swim. </p>
<p>Bryn took both children into the middle of the pool, holding them up one at a time, whereas I stayed near the edge and had the children by the hands. They liked both methods, but after a half hour or so it was breakfast and Disneyland time. I showered the children off quickly, and showered myself once Doug, Bryn, and the children went off to eat breakfast. I wasn't terribly hungry, so had some fruit in the room, but did join them for ten minutes, polishing off Riku's leftover hash browns. </p>
<p>Disneyland is less than half a mile from this hotel, and we walked over with Doug and Bryn taking turns carrying Mirei. We didn't want her tired out before she even got there. We did take a photo of the children with Doug and me outside the castle, and then set off for the rides. </p>
<p>Riku wanted to see "Pirates of the Caribbean" first, although once there Mirei was not interested at all in going on the ride. She was close to tears, as she had a bad experience in Japan with the "up and down ride" at Universal Studios, and there was no interest at all for her in this ride. However, not realizing just what it would be like, she joined us, and it was a mistake. She kept asking if it was over, and I could see that she was not having any fun at all with all the bumps, despite lots of assurance from all of us that she was safe. Mirei certainly takes after me in this regard. The ups and down were fine for me, but they wouldn't have been when I was her age. Once safely out, Mirei had a big cry, of pure relief, I think! We promised there would be no more rides like this.</p>
<p>Thank goodness she agreed, reluctantly, to go on the "It's a Small World" boat ride, as she loved every minute of it. By the time we got out she was ready to do it again, but the line up was very long by that time. She and I went off to see a Princess show and how she loved this. Everyone stood for this event, and Mirei managed to get in the very front, so she could marvel at all the princesses and women in their very fancy and pretty dresses. She joined in with the dance "lesson" given first, and then in the Maypole dance too. </p>
<p>Once the dancing was over, the princesses lined up for photos. Mirei was far more interested at that point, in collecting all the ribbons she could that had been tossed into the crowd. By the time that was done, two of the three princesses had finished, but she quite enjoying meeting Aurora. Doug had joined us after the dancing, and we met up with Bryn and Riku for lunch at a bakery/sandwich shop on Main Street. Bryn ordered sundaes for the children for a special treat. </p>
<p>We all went on the carousel together, and then Mirei and went on twice more. She wasn't interested in going on most of the rides, and I was more than happy to keep her company on the horses.</p>
<p>There were lots of crowds, and the lineups were quite long, but we wandered from spot to spot, seeing whatever interested the children. We were all tuckered out and had had enough of the heat by about 5 o'clock, and ready to leave on our trip to Carlsbad to meet up with Lee, a friend Bryn, Akane, and the children met through his "I Like Japan" website. She visited with them in Kyoto, her first trip to Japan, and I was looking forward to meeting her as well. We stopped to pick up burritos again to eat in the car, and Lee was waiting for us when we arrived at her time-share. It's a lovely room, spacious and airy, with a large bathroom, and two big beds.</p>
<p>The children were anxious to swim, so after chatting a bit with Lee in the room, and snacking on some cheese, crackers, and fruit she had thoughtfully bought for us, down we went to the pool. They had a separate play area with a water slide and hoses too, which Riku loved. Mirei stuck to the pool itself, and it wasn't long before Riku joined us too. The children were just delighted to be in the water, especially with two adults to go back and forth between. Lee stayed long enough to see us out of the water, and we said our goodbyes after arranging to meet for breakfast the next morning. </p>
<p>The children had a quick shower; I read them a story, snuggled together in the same bed, and Doug and Bryn went down to the lobby with their computers while I got them to sleep. Bryn picked me up a large cup of tea from Starbucks, and I got some reading done before heading for bed myself. It felt good knowing we wouldn't be on the move tomorrow, as Legoland is a quick walk across the road from here!</p>
