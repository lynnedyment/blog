								<h2>A Puttering About Kind of Day</h2>
								<p>We had a low-key day here today, with a long leisurely breakfast to start it off. Mirei is in her "flowers and long skinny women/girls" drawing phase, and it is sweet to sit and watch as she decides what to draw and then go for it, with no hesitation at all. She knows whether there will be a sun or a moon in any particular drawing, and what colour triangular skirt each of the girls will be wearing. Today it was a sparkling purple one, very much like one that she owns herself. </p>
<p>We worked on a wooden ABC puzzle too, over breakfast; Mirei discovered the stash in the hallway upstairs, and we took turns finding the right letter and thinking of other words that start with the same one. Mirei gets much amusement out of making up ludicrous words and I must confess I encourage her as she works to come up with anything to make me laugh! </p>
<p>Doug and I had a Costco run to do, and of course Mirei came with us. She was quite disappointed that there wasn't much food around ... the free samples she obviously remembers from trips there in the past. There was a little cup of a fruit drink and she picked out the bits of white chocolate in a dry fruit trail mix. </p>
<p>Home at 12:30 for her very favourite cheese tortellini from Costco; I took several packages with me to Japan so that she could share it with Riku too. We sat at the table while she started making a birthday card for Doug for tomorrow  and finished off her morning drawing too. Mirei now likes to cut out her drawings so today she said to me "Nana, take a picture of this drawing so I can cut it up." Oh, she knows me well! Even though I am taking photos of them all, I still don't like the idea of her cutting them all. I won't have a nice portfolio of her early works, the way I do of Riku's.  </p>
<p>While Mirei did her spelling and reading with Bryn I formed a loaf of cheese bread and set it to rise, baking it later in the day. Bryn liked it a lot, saying it didn't even need butter, but I noticed that Doug prefers it with. I have one more loaf of that ready to bake when we need it. I still haven't bought a loaf of bread since coming back from our trip to Twin Falls and B.C. </p>
<p>Not much later, Doug had some errands to run, Bryn planned his first visit to Gold's Gym, with a bargain $10 monthly fee with a Groupon I found online. So I quickly packed up a snack pack and we got dropped off at a nice playground off Mariposa on the Hill. At the time we were there Mirei was the "big kid" in a group of four children, and she generously shared her buckets, shovels, and rakes with the little ones. She did wander over to the bigger kids' area a while later, though, and went on the swing, down the slides, up the towers, and in the sandy area on that side, watching all the bigger boys clambering up and down and teasing each other. She's a people watcher, like her Nana, for sure! </p>
<p>Mirei scraped the top of one of her toes just as Bryn arrived, and she cried really hard. It's not often we hear Mirei cry, and when we do we know she really hurts. She fell against a concrete divider today and scraped her knee but only stopped to rub it and then carried on. Bryn promised her a bath would make it all better, so in she went as soon as we got home. He was right, and she showed me how it was okay minutes after getting into the water. </p>
<p>I baked talapia for dinner tonight for her, as well as tiny new potatoes and succotash; what a big meal Mirei ate! Doug had told me they were large pieces of fish, but she ate every tiny scrap of it, before moving on to the corn and lima beans, feeding me the few small pieces of red pepper she decided I should have. Last were the potatoes, and she ate most of those, saving room for ice cream for dessert.</p>
<p>There is a cheesecake baking in the oven, and as soon as it's out, I shall be heading for bed. </p>
