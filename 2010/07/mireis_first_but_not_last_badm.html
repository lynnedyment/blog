								<h2>Mirei's First, But Not Last, BADM Day Today</h2>
								<p>After Mirei's always cheerful "Good morning!" today the first thing she asked was whether we were still going to the Bay Area Discovery Museum. Certainly this is the spot that Mirei most often talks about when I am with her in Japan or on Skype with her from here to there. So, today was the day! </p>
<p>Bryn left early for work today, at 6:45 and I thought he had left before that. Somehow Mirei discovered him sitting at the bottom of the inside steps so she put on her shoes to join him. I think she asked him if she could go with him, and when Bryn came home about 6:15 Mirei re-enacted the entire conversation she had had with him! I wish I had taped it. </p>
<p>We spent the morning at home as I hoped the day would warm up a bit before we left. Mirei was busy as always doing another girl/flower/house picture... a different one today as the petals of the flower were individually decorated. This was done while she ate her fruit bowl, and <strong>two</strong> boiled eggs, one right after the other, along with toast. An hour later she ate one of Doug's orange cream yogurts; she is obviously in a growth spurt! </p>
<p>Garry called through on Skype too, so finally Mirei and Freija got to see each other and show each other their dolls, and their drawings too. Freija loves to hear new songs and Mirei sang the Totoro song to her, which Freija also knows. There is a nine hour time difference between them in Sweden and us, so it was great to have connected today and we hope to do so again many times while Mirei is here, and when Riku comes too.</p>
<p>Doug decided to go with us to the museum, so after packing up a  lunch... another feature that Mirei likes about this adventure is sitting at outside on the deck there having a picnic... we headed off late in the morning. As we approached the bridge Mirei came out with "Hey! There's the Golden Gate Bridge!". The BADM is almost right under it, so a few minutes later there we were. </p>
<p>It was a much cooler day than usual, cooler in Marin than in the city which was very unusual, but it was fine for our lunch and then we headed indoors. Mirei did a little painting, but it was crowded so she moved on to the clay table, until a little boy reached over and took something right out of her hands. It seemed a good time to head back outside for all the usual activities there... checking out the cave with all the sea stars and anemones cemented into the walls and the ceiling, looking for hidden treasure at the boat wreck (having some pennies in my pockets adds much to this activity!), clambering in and out of the boat for a much shorter time than usual, and finally climbing the hill to ring the bell at the very top of it. </p>
<p>Coming down from there is a birds nest to sit on, some frogs to rub so they sound like they're croaking, and a spider web to balance on. The most fun of all though is the twig maze/house that all the children love to run around and hide in, and be found, with loud squeals. Grandpa did a great job at pretending to be found, and at finding an easy to spot all-in-bright-pink girl too!</p>
<p>We went into the craft room next where Mirei glued and taped together a fun hanging ornament, made with a cup, two paper plates, some bright ribbon, and crepe paper. Doug managed to fix it so that it held together for display. Before we left that area Mirei built a train for some wooden animals out of blocks. </p>
<p>And last, but not least, was a visit to the tots area. Mirei is just barely under the height limit so this will be her last year to go to this special and always loved spot. There are water beds with lily pads, costumes, mirrors, and another spot with a not-too-tall two story climbing platform, complete with a tunnel and a lookout. Mirei and a playmate called Andrea quickly became pals and until names were exchanged the little one would call out "Friend, where are you?" They had such fun together and were reluctant to have it all come to a close. </p>
<p>We sang songs on the way there and back home again, with me keeping Mirei company in the back seat. I was afraid she would be falling asleep, but she was fine, although ate all the extra goodies in the lunch bag she hadn't finished earlier. She is eating lots, and even told me she wanted tortellini for her dinner "with that green stuff again" aka pesto. </p>
<p>We stopped in at the library and Mirei had a little time pulling books out to look at them herself. "Fish is Fish" is home with us, as well as the picture book of "Baby Beluga" which we have been singing. Another song she has learned is "You Are My Sunshine" and she has the first verse down pat. Mirei often walks around the house singing, or sings to herself when sitting on the floor playing with her babies. </p>
<p>Tub time for Mirei; she asked me to get my camera and take a photo of her doing "swimming, swimming, in the swimming pool... " which I did, and she had a long tub at her request. Bryn came in while she was finishing up her dinner, which was lovely as I thought he might get home after she was asleep, which was at 7:30 tonight. </p>
<p>What a lovely day this was! </p>
