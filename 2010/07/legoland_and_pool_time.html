								<h2>Legoland and Pool Time, Twice!</h2>
								<p>The children awoke at their usual time of 6:30 this morning, all set to go for a swim in the pool! We convinced them to wait a bit, have a little something to eat, and watch a bit of TV first, just so we could garner some enthusiasm for such an early swim! It's hard to resist their bright faces and enthusiasm, though, so off we went! Mirei looked adorable in her little pink suit, and she was just full of beans, suggesting I "take a picture, Nana!" after checking herself out in the two mirrors in our room. Bryn came along too, and we had such a fun time. I hadn't been all that keen (brrrrrr!), but was so happy to have taken the plunge. </p>
<p>We weren't submerged too long, as we had made arrangements with Lee last night to meet for breakfast at 8:30 in the dining room next door. We all took quick showers and dressed, and made it just in time. Breakfast was delicious: a full buffet with omelets made to order, lots of fresh fruit, yogurt, breads, hash browns, and tea pots with English breakfast tea too. </p>
<p>Lee is lovely and the children were happy to sit and make conversation over breakfast with us all. They enjoyed going back for whatever they felt like trying too, and we all had very good breakfasts. </p>
<p>Legoland is just across the street, literally a ten minute walk to the entry gates, and so the walk there along a lovely green boulevard was perfect. It was overcast today, and even that made the day very pleasant. </p>
<p>The children decided later in the day that Legoland was their favourite over Disneyland. There were no scary rides for Mirei, and she especially enjoyed driving a car on her own, while Riku enjoyed that as well as the fire engine race with his dad, and later with his Grandpa added to the team too. He and Bryn came in second that first time, and then first when Grandpa joined them. Doug said Riku absolutely made it possible for them to win, as he was an ace when it came to pointing the hose directly at the fire and holding it steady too. </p>
<p>I talked Mirei into going on a boat ride with me. She really had to be reassured that there would be no "bumps, or ups and downs" and I am so pleased she trusted me, as we had a great time being captains and sailors. Bryn and Riku were in the boat behind us and Riku too was grinning from ear to ear. </p>
<p>Later on, we watched a fun outdoor play, with a princess, two knights, and a few of the little audience members filling in as combatants. Riku sat on his own up front, and was just howling at all of the silliness. Mirei sat back with Lee and Bryn, watching from that vantage point, and obviously enjoyed it as well. </p>
<p>Bryn took Riku for a quick pizza lunch before going off to do some rides on their own. Lee, Doug, Mirei, and I were ready for a more leisurely lunch, so sat and enjoyed our spot at a big table, and our very friendly waitress, who didn't charge us for the bit of food that Mirei ate from the children's buffet: a half a grilled cheese sandwich and some broccoli and milk. </p>
<p>After lunch, Lee and I had some time to sit with our tea, relax, and get to know each other. We have so much in common, and she and I really hit if off. Bryn was sure we would, and he was right. I feel as though I have made a new friend for sure. </p>
<p>Doug took Mirei off for a bit on his own, and not only did they go down a very long slide together, but they had met up with Bryn and Riku while wandering, and Mirei had her face painted, just like the princess, whom she saw twice, before and after the face decorating. Mirei had a long talk with the princess, and Doug said she was as pleased as could be when she got a big hug from this princess too. Doug said she was the only one he saw who did! </p>
<p>We wandered around a bit more, visiting the Legoland city duplicates, which were wonderfully recreated and such fun for all of us to see. I certainly enjoyed Legoland much more than Disneyland; it was less crowded, so quieter, it was more manageable in size, so it didn't feel quite so overwhelming, and there were more interactive fun things for the children to do. Of course I took lots of photos, and it will be such fun to see them once we are home again. </p>
<p>We stopped in at the store, so the children could choose a gift. This took a while, as there were so many things that qualified as worthy, but in the long run, Mirei chose a pink rubber sword and chest plate, and Riku a wonderful complicated Lego set. </p>
<p>After that the children were anxious to spend more time in the pool, and certainly the adults were ready to head back for some time in the hotel too; the short walk home made this easy to do. </p>
<p>Lee joined us for a little while, and she and Bryn went over some of the details of her trip to Japan when she visited there in the spring. We noshed again on more of the cheese and fruit Lee had left for us last night, and that kept us going until Doug and Bryn left and picked up some take-away burritos for us once more. But that happened after our pool time. </p>
<p>Doug snapped a few photos of Riku in the water slide area, but he was happiest in the pool with Mirei and me. (Bryn had stayed behind to get some work done, for which there was a deadline). </p>
<p>There was a darling little girl named Julia in the pool. She was quite the little swimmer, and since her lovely long brown hair streamed out behind her when she was swimming, Mirei told her she looked like a mermaid. She did, too, and the three children spent their entire time in the pool with her. The children enjoy being in the water so much, that we must make sure that by the end of next summer they are both good little swimmers. Riku and Mirei both wished we were staying another day, and I must admit so did I. </p>
<p>I sat with the children in the hot tub and we chatted with some others there, before heading back to our room for those burritos, some veggies, and a few stories after we had all showered. It was a grand day and we all had such fun. </p>
<p>Tomorrow we leave for the San Diego zoo, and then head home to San Francisco tomorrow evening. </p>
