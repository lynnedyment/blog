								<h2>A Fun-Filled, Busy Day!</h2>
								<p>... and at this end of it, I am ready for bed, so I'm going to bullet write this one, as I know it could be, and already is, much wordier than I would like.</p>
<p>• The day started off with a little girl with very cold feet climbing into our bed at 7:40. She didn't say a word, just snuggled in, smiling away at me, and then waited for about five minutes before asking "Is it wake-up time?" When I assured her that it was, she said "Let's get up then!" and off she went, making sure I was right behind her. </p>
<p>• Mirei was busy drawing at the table when I finished my shower, and today made Bryn and me matching orange pictures; the tidier one was mine, though, as she pointed out, saying Daddy was a boy and he wouldn't mind. After finding cotton balls yesterday, she is quite intrigued with the possibilities of more interesting craft work, and spent a long time concentrating on pulling them apart and then carefully taping them to the pictures. They are autographed to us too. </p>
<p>• We played "Go Fish" for the first time in Japan in March, and today we had our first game here, using a lot more cards. Mirei won, and was mighty pleased with herself. She has a big heart though, and each time I got a pair she would say, "Good job, Nana!" </p>
<p>• Mirei discovered a new set of pink and white beads in her "treasure box" this morning and was delighted to be able to get right to work on them. She stopped about ten beads from the end, saying that she would "save it for tomorrow." </p>
<p>•  Babies were a big part of her morning again today, and Raggedy Andy and his friends got lots of attention from a very attentive mommy. </p>
<p>• Applesauce! We meant to make the applesauce yesterday and so promised ourselves last night that today would be the day. Mirei unpacked the apples from the bag and placed them in the sink. Then she sprayed them with the sprayer in the sink (Oh yes, she <strong>loved</strong> doing this!) and then swirled them about with her hands to get rid of any specks on them. I cut and cored; Mirei put them in the pot and added the water. I cooked them on simmer for a long long time, and Mirei asked frequently to see how they looked now. </p>
<p>• At one point during the morning I was tidying up in the living room, and realized that Mirei was singing away to herself, in Japanese, as she strung those pink beads. I went in and sat, recording her singing three different songs. She continued with her project, but would explain to me what the songs meant. I have a suspicion that they weren't correctly translated as they seemed to dwell a lot on babies being left on their own, while the mommy and daddy worked, and/or the mother, daddy, and/or the baby dying too. My my! </p>
<p>• Mirei was a very colourful flapper today! She was very busy at one point during the morning and went into her room and changed completely from tights and a light long sleeved shirt to a short puffy skirt and a tank top. Finding lots of colourful beads to hang around her neck and on her arms, completed this look. After she had posed, and admired herself in many mirrors, Grandpa called her to the computer to have a look at other flappers. This was a huge hit! We may have some of what my mom called "Gypsy Lee" blood in her! </p>
<p>• Mirei ate her usual two breakfasts, and a big lunch too, so I was very surprised at how many snacks she was able to tuck away at Costco in the very short time we were there: a quarter of a ham and cheese sandwich, her own serving plus mine of a seven-cheese tortellini, another of a tri-coloured larger tortelloni, white "chocolate" bits Doug and I donated from our trail mix, and some veggie "chips" without the spicy hummous. </p>
<p>• Oh, I forgot, there was a costume change in there before Costco, from a navy top and dark puffy pants to white puffy pants with tights under them. She did keep the beads, though, and got lots of smiles as we wandered through Costco. </p>
<p>• We spent the last hour of our day out at the Mariposa Street playground we went to a few days ago. I pointed out a girl she might be able to play with, and Mirei said she was bigger, as she was balancing at one end of a teeter totter. I suggested that maybe she could do that too, and a little later on she sauntered over and, sure enough, did it easily; she was mighty proud of herself too! </p>
<p>• The last half hour was spent playing with an older girl from a local camp group. The other girl collected water outside of the toddler area and she and Mirei had such fun playing in the wet sand, and trying hard to make a tall castle. </p>
<p>• Tub time with lots of veggies and fruits tonight as well as many many requests for very specific colours of saucers for the cups she had added earlier ... oh, and a big spoon, but not a ladle, plus a small spoon, but not one of the two I took into her, an even smaller one, and it had to be blue to match the saucer. It took a long time to get her udon noodle soup made!  It is no wonder that I am sleeping <strong>very</strong> well each night.  </p>
<p>• Dinner seemed to last a long time tonight, as Mirei had lots to talk about. We were busy with play phones and if it had been earlier, I would have recorded some of the conversations she was having, not just with me, but lots of imaginary friends, grandmas, and parents too! </p>
<p>• Mirei read to me tonight from " Are You My Mother?" and how I love the many facial expressions and the tones she uses when she reads it. I will video her reading the entire book one day soon.</p>
<p>• We said "Goodnight, see you in the morning." after I read her the story of "Skippy, the Lost Dog". Doug picked up two of the "Angelina Ballerina" books at the library for her tonight, and I promised that I would read those to her tomorrow. Deciding what to hear tonight was a tough decision before bedtime.</p>
<p>• Mirei was sound asleep at 7:35, after having yawned her way through the last few pages of Skippy.</p>
<p>• Doug was at a double feature movie tonight, after doing some volunteer work there first, and Bryn continued on to Susan's and Kevin's after work. Mirei and I had a girl's night alone here and had lots of fun.</p>
