								<h2><a href="/2010/08/riku_and_mirei_spend_the_day_o.html">They're Going to the Zoo, Zoo, Zoo ...</a></h2>
								<p>I crept downstairs at 6:15 this morning to find Bryn and the children still sleeping. I started working on an old unanswered email, and before I had finished three sentences Riku joined me, looking a little upset. He had a nightmare about killing me(!), and so we sat and talked about dreams and nightmares for a bit. I told him about some of my worst nightmares too, and how it helps to know that we never really end up dying or killing someone in our dreams.</p>
<p>We had three games of "Snakes and Chutes" this morning; he won two of them, and after the middle game, which I won, he said "Congratulations Nana!" and seemed sincere too. Slowly but surely, these things come around. </p>
<p>While sitting at the table, talking about what to have for breakfast ... Mirei had suggested pancakes but Riku told her they were for Sunday ... he came out with "French toast should be for Saturday breakfasts!" and so it was. </p>
<p>Bryn has made plans for the day out with the children, accompanying Susan, Amelia, and Finn to the San Francisco zoo. So, it was a short morning here, as they left the house just before 10, and returned home at 5:30! </p>
<p>This gave me a good amount of time to work on my photos from the end of July through today, and write up a few blog entries that I had notes for, but haven't been finished. It was great, as Doug was here, and worked on reducing the huge stack of them to blog size for me, as well as doing all the cropping necessary for the photos that go into the online album. I did some laundry, finished making the rice pudding that Mirei and Riku had helped start before they left, and got a few other housework tasks taken care of as well. </p>
<p>Doug left for a book reading shortly after Bryn and the children arrived home; they had a fabulous day and spent the entire time at the zoo. Susan had sent me a photo of Amelia and Finn, and Bryn sent me the ones he had taken before heading off to Susan and Kevin's for dinner. The children had a tub that wasn't as quick as they said they wanted (no surprise there as they really enjoy their tub time together), and then it was upstairs to watch "The Rescuers", a movie Doug had picked up from the library for them yesterday. I joined them  of course, and was up and down the stairs during the last half hour with ice cream for Mirei for dessert, strawberries for Riku, and then watermelon for Mirei. They ate a lot tonight, enjoying the big bowls of thin noodles and lots of veggies while watching the movie. </p>
<p>As they were doing their nighttime routine, Riku told me he was afraid of ghosts and didn't want to wait alone while I tucked Mirei into bed. I did tell him I don't allow ghosts in my house (he knows that there are no ghosts but ... ) and suggested that we all tuck in together in the bed and read a story they would both like. "Frog and Toad" was the perfect choice for tonight and they both enjoyed it. I was snuggled between them and was surprised that Riku was asleep first, even though he whispered to me that he was going to wait until I could turn over and cuddle him. I guess my hand on his leg was comfort enough. </p>
<p>I left their room at 8 o'clock, tidied the kitchen, and Doug walked in just at the perfect time for more photo work! I had found some wonderful photos taken nine years ago when we were living in Cambridge and put some of them up on Facebook today. Now I'm working on another online file folder filled with even more. What wonderful memories these brought back! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/08/a_funfilled_day_out_for_the_ch.html">A Fun-Filled Day Out for the Children and Bryn (and Sad Family News This Morning).</a></h2>
								<p>We all slept in this morning. Usually the children are awake between 6:15 and 6:30, with few exceptions, but today Riku slept until 6:45 and Mirei until 7:25, a twelve-hour sleep for her! Riku and I snuck out of the room about a half hour earlier. He spent some time with Bryn in his room, and then I read the two library books that they had taken out last night. Mirei joined us for half of the last one, snuggled up in my arms. </p>
<p>Bryn wanted to take Riku off to "Jim's" for breakfast this morning, so they left shortly after we all had our fruit plates. A typical breakfast for Riku there is an egg with his much loved hash browns, but today he didn't feel like an egg. The owner brought him over a bowl of stew instead, which he enjoyed very much. Riku and his dad worked on a drawing while waiting to be served and it was fun to see. Bryn took a photo of it, so I can add it here. </p>
<p>Mirei and I had great plans ... make a cherry pie, paint ... but she ended up wanting to do some crafts project instead, and made a great little booklet with four pages, each one drawn in and with quite a fancy cover too! Of course she ate her breakfast of what she said was a delicious boiled egg and toast, with no "bacon" today.</p>
<p>Much to my surprise, Riku turned down Bryn's offer to take him to climb the rock pile again, so they were home again within an hour or so. </p>
<p>However, while they were gone I heard from Candy via email that Paul had passed on this morning at 9:10 our time. It was a brief email with no more detail than that, but later on I had a long talk with both Gail and Candy, and finally Beth as well. The house is full of family members, and there wasn't too much time to talk, of course. It is so sad, but the last few days have been especially tough, with much pain for Paul, so it was time I suppose for his body to finally give in. He was a good man, was our Paul, and we are so sorry his life ended far too soon. He was only 67 years old. He did fight very hard, as he was diagnosed with lung cancer a year ago May, and it was suspected to be cancer two or three months before that. The doctors would not say at the time how much time he had, but a guess was that he wouldn't be alive at Christmas. </p>
<p>Bryn wanted to see a drawing exhibit by David Byrne and Dave Eggars at 11, so Riku was happy to find he and Mirei had time to watch a half hour of "Monsters Vs. Aliens". </p>
<p>Doug joined them for the art show, while Mirei and I played with two of the three sets of tiny magnet stories that Kelly had bought many years ago for Riku. When Riku came home, and the children learned that they were waiting until Susan called for their afternoon playdate, I went upstairs and sat between them as they watched the last of their movie. I thought Mirei might be frightened but she assured me she thought it was "silly" and "not scary". </p>
<p>The three of them left about noon, and I got busy organizing all the photos and blog entries that needed some attention. I need a full week or two alone to really get caught up on this job, but I made a good start at it again today, thanks to Doug and all his photo help. </p>
<p>Along with Bryn's morning pics, Susan sent three photos on from their Yerba Buena playground date, and perhaps there will be one or two from the dinner date with a family from "Little Angels" days this evening too. </p>
<p>Bryn came home with the children just before 8 o'clock. They had a very successful day, from morning until it ended tonight with a yummy dinner and lots of Wii/Lego/Star Wars time for Riku. There were two boys, one Riku's age, and his playmate from those school days four years ago, and a little fellow too, about a year and a bit old perhaps. Bryn said Mirei was able to keep herself busy despite there not being a playmate just for her. </p>
<p>I popped them both in the tub, to remove the sticky blue popsicle juice from Mirei's tummy(!) and to relax them too. Both had a little trouble falling asleep, though, despite the late hour, and I walked out of their room at 9:15, the very latest they have been awake since they arrived. </p>
<p>It's off to bed with me too soon, as that eight plus hours last night felt just right! </p>
<p>Beth is so very much on my mind; she will be sleeping without Paul for the first time in many many months tonight, and waking to her new reality tomorrow morning. Life can be so very hard. </p>
