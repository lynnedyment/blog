								<h2>They're Going to the Zoo, Zoo, Zoo ...</h2>
								<p>I crept downstairs at 6:15 this morning to find Bryn and the children still sleeping. I started working on an old unanswered email, and before I had finished three sentences Riku joined me, looking a little upset. He had a nightmare about killing me(!), and so we sat and talked about dreams and nightmares for a bit. I told him about some of my worst nightmares too, and how it helps to know that we never really end up dying or killing someone in our dreams.</p>
<p>We had three games of "Snakes and Chutes" this morning; he won two of them, and after the middle game, which I won, he said "Congratulations Nana!" and seemed sincere too. Slowly but surely, these things come around. </p>
<p>While sitting at the table, talking about what to have for breakfast ... Mirei had suggested pancakes but Riku told her they were for Sunday ... he came out with "French toast should be for Saturday breakfasts!" and so it was. </p>
<p>Bryn has made plans for the day out with the children, accompanying Susan, Amelia, and Finn to the San Francisco zoo. So, it was a short morning here, as they left the house just before 10, and returned home at 5:30! </p>
<p>This gave me a good amount of time to work on my photos from the end of July through today, and write up a few blog entries that I had notes for, but haven't been finished. It was great, as Doug was here, and worked on reducing the huge stack of them to blog size for me, as well as doing all the cropping necessary for the photos that go into the online album. I did some laundry, finished making the rice pudding that Mirei and Riku had helped start before they left, and got a few other housework tasks taken care of as well. </p>
<p>Doug left for a book reading shortly after Bryn and the children arrived home; they had a fabulous day and spent the entire time at the zoo. Susan had sent me a photo of Amelia and Finn, and Bryn sent me the ones he had taken before heading off to Susan and Kevin's for dinner. The children had a tub that wasn't as quick as they said they wanted (no surprise there as they really enjoy their tub time together), and then it was upstairs to watch "The Rescuers", a movie Doug had picked up from the library for them yesterday. I joined them  of course, and was up and down the stairs during the last half hour with ice cream for Mirei for dessert, strawberries for Riku, and then watermelon for Mirei. They ate a lot tonight, enjoying the big bowls of thin noodles and lots of veggies while watching the movie. </p>
<p>As they were doing their nighttime routine, Riku told me he was afraid of ghosts and didn't want to wait alone while I tucked Mirei into bed. I did tell him I don't allow ghosts in my house (he knows that there are no ghosts but ... ) and suggested that we all tuck in together in the bed and read a story they would both like. "Frog and Toad" was the perfect choice for tonight and they both enjoyed it. I was snuggled between them and was surprised that Riku was asleep first, even though he whispered to me that he was going to wait until I could turn over and cuddle him. I guess my hand on his leg was comfort enough. </p>
<p>I left their room at 8 o'clock, tidied the kitchen, and Doug walked in just at the perfect time for more photo work! I had found some wonderful photos taken nine years ago when we were living in Cambridge and put some of them up on Facebook today. Now I'm working on another online file folder filled with even more. What wonderful memories these brought back! </p>
