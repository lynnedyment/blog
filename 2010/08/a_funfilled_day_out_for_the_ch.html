								<h2>A Fun-Filled Day Out for the Children and Bryn (and Sad Family News This Morning).</h2>
								<p>We all slept in this morning. Usually the children are awake between 6:15 and 6:30, with few exceptions, but today Riku slept until 6:45 and Mirei until 7:25, a twelve-hour sleep for her! Riku and I snuck out of the room about a half hour earlier. He spent some time with Bryn in his room, and then I read the two library books that they had taken out last night. Mirei joined us for half of the last one, snuggled up in my arms. </p>
<p>Bryn wanted to take Riku off to "Jim's" for breakfast this morning, so they left shortly after we all had our fruit plates. A typical breakfast for Riku there is an egg with his much loved hash browns, but today he didn't feel like an egg. The owner brought him over a bowl of stew instead, which he enjoyed very much. Riku and his dad worked on a drawing while waiting to be served and it was fun to see. Bryn took a photo of it, so I can add it here. </p>
<p>Mirei and I had great plans ... make a cherry pie, paint ... but she ended up wanting to do some crafts project instead, and made a great little booklet with four pages, each one drawn in and with quite a fancy cover too! Of course she ate her breakfast of what she said was a delicious boiled egg and toast, with no "bacon" today.</p>
<p>Much to my surprise, Riku turned down Bryn's offer to take him to climb the rock pile again, so they were home again within an hour or so. </p>
<p>However, while they were gone I heard from Candy via email that Paul had passed on this morning at 9:10 our time. It was a brief email with no more detail than that, but later on I had a long talk with both Gail and Candy, and finally Beth as well. The house is full of family members, and there wasn't too much time to talk, of course. It is so sad, but the last few days have been especially tough, with much pain for Paul, so it was time I suppose for his body to finally give in. He was a good man, was our Paul, and we are so sorry his life ended far too soon. He was only 67 years old. He did fight very hard, as he was diagnosed with lung cancer a year ago May, and it was suspected to be cancer two or three months before that. The doctors would not say at the time how much time he had, but a guess was that he wouldn't be alive at Christmas. </p>
<p>Bryn wanted to see a drawing exhibit by David Byrne and Dave Eggars at 11, so Riku was happy to find he and Mirei had time to watch a half hour of "Monsters Vs. Aliens". </p>
<p>Doug joined them for the art show, while Mirei and I played with two of the three sets of tiny magnet stories that Kelly had bought many years ago for Riku. When Riku came home, and the children learned that they were waiting until Susan called for their afternoon playdate, I went upstairs and sat between them as they watched the last of their movie. I thought Mirei might be frightened but she assured me she thought it was "silly" and "not scary". </p>
<p>The three of them left about noon, and I got busy organizing all the photos and blog entries that needed some attention. I need a full week or two alone to really get caught up on this job, but I made a good start at it again today, thanks to Doug and all his photo help. </p>
<p>Along with Bryn's morning pics, Susan sent three photos on from their Yerba Buena playground date, and perhaps there will be one or two from the dinner date with a family from "Little Angels" days this evening too. </p>
<p>Bryn came home with the children just before 8 o'clock. They had a very successful day, from morning until it ended tonight with a yummy dinner and lots of Wii/Lego/Star Wars time for Riku. There were two boys, one Riku's age, and his playmate from those school days four years ago, and a little fellow too, about a year and a bit old perhaps. Bryn said Mirei was able to keep herself busy despite there not being a playmate just for her. </p>
<p>I popped them both in the tub, to remove the sticky blue popsicle juice from Mirei's tummy(!) and to relax them too. Both had a little trouble falling asleep, though, despite the late hour, and I walked out of their room at 9:15, the very latest they have been awake since they arrived. </p>
<p>It's off to bed with me too soon, as that eight plus hours last night felt just right! </p>
<p>Beth is so very much on my mind; she will be sleeping without Paul for the first time in many many months tonight, and waking to her new reality tomorrow morning. Life can be so very hard. </p>
