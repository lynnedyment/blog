								<h2>Needles and a Hair Cut</h2>
								<p>Akane, Riku, Mirei, and I were out the door at 9ish this morning for a walk to the children's doctor, whose office is on the road beside the river. As we were dashing along to the main street, the farmer's wife stopped Akane to tell her she was going to bring over some seasonal greens, with yellow flowery tops, for me. </p>
<p>She and Riku had lots of fun playing together in the waiting room; it's interesting to see how shy Mirei is with strangers and she took Riku by the hand to go over with her to play with the building blocks. </p>
<p>Mirei had talked herself into being very brave again this morning, but at the last minute, as she spotted the needle, she cried. Poor wee girl. It's hard to see this, but I know it's necessary. She sobbed in my arms while Riku had his, and soon we were on our way home again. </p>
<p>Riku had said last week that his hair was driving him crazy, and he wanted to get it cut on Saturday, but he resisted the idea, suggesting it happen tomorrow instead. Akane stopped in at a local spot to ask the price: ¥2000, so over $20 for a child's cut. She decided later that day that she would cut it herself. </p>
<p>Akane made rice stuffed omelettes for lunch today—delicious—and then Riku had his three-hour session with his Chinese tutor. Mirei would love nothing more than to join in and make it a threesome, so she and I went for a walk, first to the "old" playground, where there really isn't much to do, so we soon after walked to a small shrine area close by, where she put her little hands together twice, once at a pump, and before entering a sitting area. She picked some tiny flowers ("weeds") for Akane, and we moved on to the second playground, past the house in the opposite direction. </p>
<p>Mirei was interested in finding bugs today, so spent lots of time crouched down, turning over small rocks, etc. She was especially delighted when I spotted a mostly black ladybug and convinced it to walk on a leaf she picked, and then go for a walk on her hand. I took some lovely shots of her, one in which she looks very much like her Auntie Ayako. </p>
<p>It was really warm outside today, and with no wind at all,  so for the first time this trip we didn't wear our jackets. Hope it keeps up! </p>
<p>Once home again, we went into my room while Riku had his last half hour with Han. We read three stories, and then Mirei kept busy with a square of pink paper, carefully turning down the corners and then taping them, before cutting out bits to tape onto a square of silver paper. She's very meticulous and patient, this little girl.</p>
<p>Bryn was busy all this time finishing up sorting through more "stuff", in his quest to lighten up the household; I could use this boy at my house!, </p>
<p>When it was time for Riku's haircut, he sat on a chair in front of the TV, watching a movie with Mirei, with a plastic clothes/body protector around his neck to keep the hair off him. It worked beautifully, and Riku sat patiently while Akane snipped away. His hair looked so much better almost instantly, as Akane does a great job at shaping it. </p>
<p>Chinese food was ordered in for dinner. It comes on individual plates or in bowls, some plastic, some ceramic, and the next day the driver comes by and picks them up from outside the front door. Akane had ordered a gingery-flavoured vegetable dish for me, enough for two meals, and Bryn fed Riku the fresh noodle dish while he had his hair cut. I must say I could not keep my eyes off this boy; his hair is so thick and it doesn't have to get very long before his fine features are lost in it. </p>
<p>Ayako was here when I came out from tucking in Riku. She is here for two nights and I know the children will be delighted to see her in the morning. Once Akane was down from tucking Mirei in, the two of them headed out for dinner together. I happily wrote some emails and went to bed at a decent hour.</p>
