								<h2>Easter Morning... a Week Early</h2>
								<p>Mirei was awake especially early today, and Riku was ready to join her in the big Easter egg hunt the minute she came down the stairs and into our room. It was just 6:30, and I was very surprised to find they had already entered the living room and had found a couple of eggs before their parents were downstairs. So, I hid them, Akane and Bryn came down just a few minutes later, and the children were off, dashing from spot to spot. It was lots of fun to see... they obviously remembered all the good spots, so cushions were lifted, curtains pulled aside, every drawer in the room opened, and they were up on tip-toe and down on the floor peeking everywhere. </p>
<p>Mirei spotted a bag with blue ribbon, and knew that was Riku's. The idea was that they would find them all, and then share them at the end. However, <strong>this</strong> particular bag had a candy in it that for some reason appealed to her, so she had a chat with Riku convincing him that she would give him a really good one of hers in exchange. Riku agreed, mission accomplished, and back they went to work until every packet, plus the one big gift, was discovered. </p>
<p>They sat tidying up their found treasures, comparing them, and were given permission to eat one packet each. Chocolate was saved for after lunch. </p>
<p>As the children were inspecting the booty, Bryn was busy making his homemade hashbrowns, Akane scrambled the eggs, bread was sliced and toasted, and a fresh pot of tea and juice was ready for us to enjoy. The hash browns were a hit with all of us; Bryn felt they could have been slightly less well cooked last night, but I thought they were perfect and did they ever hit the spot. Yum! </p>
<p>I have written up today in three segments so on to the next... the temple market. </p>
