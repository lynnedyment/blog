								<h2>The Farmer and Photo Ops</h2>
								<p>On our way to school today, Riku was delighted to spot the farmer we haven't seen together since I arrived here this trip. He was standing with a woman wielding a wheelbarrow, one of his helpers, who was very pleased to see Riku; there were lots of big smiles exchanged. This was the fellow who gave me the huge cabbage last May, and it was lovely to see him again. I took a couple of photos, of course! </p>
<p>I passed a long narrow field of the yellow topped greens that the farmer's wife had brought over for me to try, so snapped a photo of those growing. They look like pretty weeds to me, and I would never have guessed they were a crop.</p>
<p>Riku and I sang all the way to school this morning, and talked about how a song gets in your head and doesn't go away until you sing something else. He was quite taken with "Lollipop, Lollipop" which he heard yesterday in the movie we watched, and I must remember to have Bryn play it for him tonight. I think Riku could easily be a fan of 60s music! </p>
<p>There was a woman with a big woven straw basket out cutting cabbages in the field by the school, after Riku and I had snuck in our goodbye kisses. After taking a couple of surreptitious photos of her from the back, she turned at one point and called out "ohayo gozaimasu" (sort of pronounced "ohio goes-ay-maws"). I took advantage of her big smile to ask if I could take her photo, and was rewarded with a big smile and a "yes". She thanked me after I took it, and I, of course, thanked her. Lovely people here. </p>
<p>Riku was out of school at 12:15 today; it was rainy but his smile was sunny as he came toward me. I do love these walks to and from the school with him; I know the time will come when he prefers to walk on his own. </p>
<p>Akane was home to make a hot tasty lunch for Bryn and Riku, and cooked up some fried tofu in broth, along with some noodles and veggies for me later on. Yum! </p>
<p>Riku had a sheet of homework to do, did his piano practice with Akane, and then he suggested that he read me a chapter in his book; he's anxious to have his dad download a game for him on the iPhone, which happens when he has finished this second reading of the book about baboons. </p>
<p>It was a coldish, dreary day, and at one point I told him it was the kind of day when I would like to lie on the sofa, with a box of chocolates at hand, and nibble and read the afternoon away. He thought that sounded great, went off and put some M&M-like candies in a little cup, and we did exactly that. We covered up with a blanket, Riku would read a page, eat a candy, and hand one to me, and on we went until the end of the chapter. </p>
<p>He had a longer spell of playtime before his tutor came at 3 o'clock. Akane had an errand to run and picked up Mirei, so I remained cuddled up on the sofa and used the computer, catching up on emails. </p>
<p>At 5:30, Bryn suggested that I join him on a snack run to the 7/11. It was raining hard, so we headed off with brollies up for Bryn's canned coffee drink and BBQ/salt & vinegar Pringle-style potato chips. I thought there was a good chance that we would run into Akane and Mirei, and sure enough, we stood and watched a couple of buses go by, and Mirei, who never misses a thing, spotted us from the bus. What big smiles greeted us when she and Akane alit. We held hands and huddled under the brolly the few blocks home.  </p>
<p>I convinced her to have her tub time early, and she mixed me up a yummy cake again while standing in the tub. She was warm and pink-cheeked after her bath, and all ready for bedtime once her dinner was over. </p>
<p>Riku gave up some free time after dinner to make a card for his teacher, rather than use his half hour in the morning to do so. It was a drawing of the school, and of course I took a photo of it. </p>
<p>Akane fell asleep with Mirei tonight, so I had the use of the computer all evening, until bedtime just past 11 P.M. I made good use of the time too, as Bryn sent all the photos I have taken so far to Doug, and I sent Doug a list of photos that can be uploaded to my last week's worth of blog entries. Bryn played all the videos I had taken too, so that was lots of fun, exclaiming over them together. </p>
<p>Cold nights again; glad I have my two warming units tucked in with me, my bed "buddy" (grain filled bag that gets heated in the microwave)  and Riku too!</p>
