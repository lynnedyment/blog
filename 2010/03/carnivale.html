								<h2>Carnivale!</h2>
								<p>Today Mirei celebrated "Carnivale" at her French nursery school, and I was there to share in it with her. Akane was preparing inari for the snack the children were having at 11 A.M., so I took Mirei off to school for the first time this trip. I was invited to stay in the classroom with her, and helped Mirei and many of her classmates get their costumes on. There were two pirates, Snow White, many princesses (Mirei was one of them), a chimney sweep, two Spidermen, a cowboy, and a couple of animals too, among many others. </p>
<p>They joined up with the Japanese preschoolers who share the same building, meeting in the gym. It was really cold in there, and it was a good thing the children did lots of running around during the various activities that were planned for them ... six children held on to the sides of a plastic sheet, and ran up and down the length of the gym twice, trying hard not to let the ball that was in the centre of it drop. They did so well at this game, all keeping up their sections of the sheet. </p>
<p>Mirei especially loved the ring toss, and she and another girl got to do it over and over, as they were happy to run and collect the rings after the others had finished their turn. The last was a ball toss competition which Mirei found less interesting.</p>
<p>Right after that it was time to watch a bit of an actual parade in France, with her very handsome and very sweet teacher Hugo, explaining what was going on. The children were lined up and got to have their own parade, with lots of flashes going on as the adults took photos of it all. </p>
<p>Lots of food was lined up along two tables, and the children came up with their paper plates to choose their own. Most of them took the chips, tiny packages of cookies, and treats, rather than the sandwiches and more adult food, which was fine, as the adults were hungry and ready to enjoy the rest of it! There was a delicious apple cake, not too sweet, that was so tasty, and I made sure to get one of the inari before they disappeared. One of the moms had made a white chocolate with strawberry confection, cut into tiny squares and covered lightly with powdered sugar. These too were <strong>so</strong> tasty, and I was very pleased when Hugo presented me with the very last one, after he had passed them around the crowd. </p>
<p>It was fun for me; Senko was there, the gal who was over for dinner last Saturday, and after we agreed that it was very cold in the gym, she kindly gave me a "heat pack" which I placed over my turtleneck, and used to keep my hands warm, one at a time! I talked with several of the moms, all of whom spoke some English, and was very pleased to meet the mother of a little boy I had fallen in love with ... quite a short little fellow, big dark eyes, lots of dark curls, and with the most animated and sweet face. I got her email address so that I could send her the photos I had taken of her son, as she arrived later in the morning. </p>
<p>Mirei was out of school at noon hour, but we stayed on for a bit in the gym, playing toss with the pink balloon she had managed to get hold of. We had the whole afternoon at home, making lots of yummy things with the purple Play-Doh, having a late lunch together, and reading too. While Riku read to me, Mirei played a matching game on Riku's iPhone. She's good at it and very quick and each time she finished one she would call out "I did it!" and Bryn and I congratulated her on it. This little girl really knows how to concentrate on things, as she was as still as could be while playing, except for letting us know she had been successful. </p>
<p>I picked Riku up from school, he got his homework and reading out of the way before dinner ... the last of the boxed mac' and cheese (next week it will be made from scratch as the children really like it), and Akane went off to her French class. </p>
<p>During dinner with Bryn, we played a YouTube version of Gene Kelly singing and dancing to "Singing in the Rain". I should have taken a photo of the looks on their faces as he splashed and cavorted in the rain. Riku especially liked the ending when a disapproving policeman showed up to stop it all. </p>
<p>Tub time together tonight ... with Mirei's kitchen items and Riku's dragons sharing the water. At one point Mirei was serving "sparkling juusu" (juice), to one of the dragons. Adorable. </p>
<p>Bryn and I met in the living room before 8 o'clock with both children soundly asleep in their beds.</p>
