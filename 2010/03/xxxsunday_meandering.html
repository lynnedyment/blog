								<h2>Sunday Meandering</h2>
								<p>Today was another slow relaxing day, although Mirei and Akane had to dash to get out the door at 8:30 for Mirei's three-hour playdate with her French teacher at his home. Riku got to have a second lazy morning at home, watching a movie, doing bits and pieces of his homework -- journal writing, and reading to me -- in between. He was busy with a new Lego kit, and enjoyed his time at home. </p>
<p>After lunch the children got involved with a movie, and Bryn suggested that I go out for a walk. I was tempted to stay put, as I was comfortable and warm, but he was right ... it was a lovely day, and I took along my book, bought some chips at the local corner store, and sat at the riverside, reading and enjoying the view. There were two children with shorts on, accompanied by their dad, with fishing nets in the shallows on the other side of the river, and I got a bit of a video of one of the egrets fishing and taking off and landing further along as I walked. </p>
<p>I was out for three hours, strolling along, taking dozens of photos of whatever caught my eye, and enjoyed wandering into and out of the many little stores along my route. </p>
<p>I took photos of four different flavoured teas in containers (apple, grape, lemon, and milk), four thick slices of bread for 105Y, four stalks of asparagus for 98Y, and an aisle full of various beers. I took photos of individually wrapped carrots (58Y), eggs sold in tens, not the dozen we buy (208Y), a large variety of prepared fried foods, and hard liquors too, in one of the bigger supermarkets. </p>
<p>One day I will publish all the photos of the tiniest homes set amongst much larger grander homes, tiny shops tucked in beside massive ones, shops attached to homes, and of course lots of planted garden areas everywhere. </p>
<p>On my way home I was rewarded by catching the "snowman lady" just going into her house. I called out to her and she turned, smiling, and gave me permission to take her photo, by sweeping her hand in agreement to my obvious question. What a lovely way to end my walk!</p>
<p>Bryn had been out working at a cafe, and got home shortly after I did. Akane had dinner ready for us, and I sat with the children as they finished eating, bathed them, and got them ready for bed. </p>
<p>Bryn and I had a glass of sake, this evening served in a small wooden box! I quite enjoyed answering emails and working on my family tree, sipping away at it.</p>
