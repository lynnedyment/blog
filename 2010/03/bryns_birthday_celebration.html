								<h2>Bryn's Birthday Celebration</h2>
								<p>Saturday is the one day of the week when no one has to leave the house early, and so we took advantage of it today. I stayed in my PJs for the longest time ever, relaxing over my breakfast while the children sat at the table, working on birthday cards for Bryn. They were careful about hiding them, so he couldn't see them, and after watching Riku set up barriers around his, Mirei followed suit. The children watched some TV, both did their reading, and once I was showered and dressed the three of us set out for a short walk before lunch. </p>
<p>There is a 105Y store near the main grocery store in this little area, and we headed straight for that ... just to look. I hadn't taken my wallet with me, but promised we would go back soon to buy the glittery green necklace and two pink rings set for Mirei, and the helicopter that "really flies" for Riku. On the way home, we passed what Riku has called "the ghost house" since last year. It is dark and tall and a little run down, and as we passed by Riku started telling a ghost story about it. He suggested that I continue, so I did, and then it was Mirei's turn. We kept this up most of the way home, stopping only to see if the "snowman lady" was out today. Alas, she was not, but we always check.</p>
<p>Riku's Chinese tutor, Han, was over from 1-4 this afternoon, so Mirei and I spent some time in my room, she trying hard to help blow up balloons, and helping me wrap gifts for Bryn. She found a little straw hat, and sat on my bed filling it with various kitchen toys, keeping herself happy and occupied for the longest time. </p>
<p>Bryn's birthday dinner was lots of fun for everyone. He had asked for pasta and Akane prepared a really delicious Italian dinner, complete with garlic-y bruschetta, and spaghettini with a very light tossing of tomato sauce, with sauteed mushrooms and spinach on the side. I was in the mood for Italian too, so I enjoyed every single bite of it all, as did we all. </p>
<p>Bryn had asked for chocolate cake as well, and Akane had cycled off in the afternoon to pick up the one she had ordered the other day. It was perfect, a small and oh-so-tasty chocolate treat. Riku watched as Bryn put all forty-two candles on the cake, barely big enough to hold them all, and Mirei spooned out the whipped cream that came along with it. </p>
<p>Bryn was obviously delighted with the sweet cards the children had made for him, and I think the best part of the party was watching their faces as he opened and commented on them. I was very pleased that Bryn liked the cozy L.L.Bean slippers I had ordered for him; Doug had picked the size correctly ... phew. There were a few extra little gifts too from us and he did well in the "spirits" department too, as he received sake and whiskey too. </p>
<p>I was delighted to be here for this birthday celebration, as I don't think it will happen nearly as often as would be ideal. </p>
<p>p.s. Today was also Doug's and my 45th wedding anniversary. We haven't spent many of our anniversaries apart, but today he was in England and I in Japan, a much further distance, for certain, than ever before. We shall celebrate with dinner out one night in San Francisco.</p>
