								<h2>Riku's Big Day: His First Piano Recital</h2>
								<p>Today is the day we have all been looking forward to for some time, to see Riku on stage playing the pieces he has been practicing and enjoying playing for some time. </p>
<p>He and Akane set off at 10:30 for a noon rehearsal, while Bryn, Mirei, and I spent a quiet morning at home. It was raining and we had to take two buses, but she's such a little trouper, easy to travel with and as patient as could be. </p>
<p>When we arrived, not long before the 2 P.M. performance, Riku looked very handsome in his dark slacks and vest, with a white shirt and black tie. Very debonair! He seemed very relaxed about everything, and I don't think it occurred to him to be nervous about this public performance at all. He had a little bit of time to play with his two cousins, who arrived about the same time we did, and then we took our seats and he went off backstage. Akane's parents and sister arrived just in time, so there was a nice family group there for Riku's special day. </p>
<p>The stage was beautifully set with a grand Steinway piano and two big gorgeous displays of flowers. Riku was perhaps the third or fourth child to play; he came out to the front of the stage, bowed without looking out at the crowd, took his seat and played beautifully. He didn't do the usual relaxed swaying he shows at home when playing, but he was certainly relaxed and not at all self conscious about being centre stage. As he bowed at the end of his performance, Haruka, his five-year-old cousin, and Mirei ran up with bouquets to give to him. It was all very sweet. </p>
<p>Riku was one of two boys in the concert, and the other was a teenager. We sat and watched the other pianists, and were all very impressed with the calibre of the talent. It was just sheer pleasure to sit and listen to them and I was especially pleased to hear the teacher play. She's lovely, and I am sure that she is one of the reasons that Riku is doing so well, and enjoying his lessons as he does. She is nurturing and so very encouraging, and also allows her students to choose pieces they would like to play or play them in more than one style. </p>
<p>Riku was on stage for one more piece with all of the younger players, singing "Do Re Me" accompanied by bell ringing, which was lots of fun to see and watch. Following that was a group photo of the students and there were lots of cameras were flashing from all sides.</p>
<p>Before leaving for home, the four children got to spend some time together in the lobby of the hall, until it was time for goodbyes, and we all went our separate ways. We five popped in a cab, as both children were tired, and we were ready to get the evening routine started with them. </p>
<p>After dinner and baths, Akane and Bryn went off with Ayako, to join the Godas for dinner downtown at their hotel, and I tucked the children into bed. </p>
<p>Riku played on the computer for the twenty minutes that it took me to read "Small Pig" to Mirei — she was pointing to all the words she recognized, and learned a couple of new ones too — and leave her sleeping. </p>
<p>After his story, Riku too fell asleep quickly. He went to bed knowing we were all very proud of him. Bryn especially had told him so many times today how proud he was. Riku had enjoyed his day too. Can't wait to see what next year brings ... perhaps Mirei will be on stage too! </p>
<p>I stayed up until Akane and Bryn arrived home at midnight, after a very rare night out for them, perhaps the first since I was here last May. </p>
