								<h2>Monday ... Some Familiar Faces</h2>
								<p>Riku's internal clock goes off about 6:30 most mornings; he's always the first one awake, and the first thing he does is turn on the switch in the living room for the heat. Fifteen or twenty minutes later, when Bryn comes down the living/dining room and kitchen have started to warm up. Riku now sits and watches part of a movie on his mom's computer until Bryn has his fruit bowl ready. Nice little pattern for him. </p>
<p>Walking Riku to school has always been a favourite part of my day, whether it was in San Francisco, or here in Kyoto. I was hoping when we left the house today that we would see some of the people we used to meet on this walk, and we lucked out immediately. The very friendly woman, who lives just around the first corner on the way to school, used to be out sweeping her little courtyard each morning, but today she was up on a tiny, second level balcony hanging her laundry. She must have recognized our voices, as she stepped up to the edge of the balcony to wish us a good morning. I was delighted to see her again. </p>
<p>Riku told me that he now says hello to two other people on his walk, and insisted we walk a different way than we used to so he could see them. Right on cue, another friendly woman, wearing one of those old-fashioned "prairie bonnets", stepped out from her house to say good morning as well. Riku told her I was his daddy's mother, and we bowed and smiled to each other. Apparently her husband is often with her, so Riku was a bit disappointed that I wouldn't meet him today too. Lots of days left for this though... </p>
<p>We held hands all the way to school, as we always did, and said good morning to the principal, another person I was looking forward to seeing again. I used to walk Riku into the school building itself, but today as we rounded the corner to go up a short ramp to the schoolground, Riku told me I could leave him there, and I learned later this is where Bryn leaves him now. Riku took a quick look around before he kissed me goodbye, something he wasn't shy about last spring. </p>
<p>On the way back to the house I passed a mom and her daughter who live just a block from here; we passed each other each school day when I was here in the spring and she greeted me with a very big smile and cheery "good morning" too. It's lovely being back! </p>
<p>Akane's etching press and a few other items that have been stored at a studio since last year were being delivered this morning, and Akane and Bryn were busy with that for a few hours. The press is extremely heavy and had to go up a flight of stairs; I sat answering emails while all of that was going on as it sounded dangerous and tricky, and I didn't want to witness any of it. It was cold with the door open and I was chilled to the bone. I can't seem to get warm here and hope that there is an early spring! </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn went out to run some errands in the early afternoon, so I had some time to write emails and do a little ancestry work. The time flew by though and I went off to meet Riku at 3:30 in a light drizzle. I took his brolly with me, and was greeted with his very happy smile when we met up before he reached the bridge. Back at home,  I made him up one of the snacks I used to make for him in SF... an egg and "bacon" sandwich on toast and a cup of hot chocolate, with apples on the side. </p>
<p>Riku had a little homework to do and did it in a jiffy... writing down what time it was for each of the dozen pictures of  clocks featured, and then we went upstairs while he did some piano practicing. I can't help him with it, but he's very happy to sit going through his books and playing the pieces he especially enjoys and some that he thinks I will especially like. I did some taping again, as I want to be able to see these once I am back at home. It's obvious that Riku so enjoys playing.                </p>
<p>Mirei came home with Bryn and Akane just after 4:30 and spent the next half hour spinning and dancing and cavorting about with just her sleeveless undershirt and her long socks! I was cold just looking at her, but her skin was as warm as could be. I took some video and pics of her, and that big happy smile of hers. What a delight this little girl is.</p>
<p>At one point, Akane showed her a cream puff she had bought for her for dessert, and Mirei immediately offered to share it with me. Bryn said he wanted half too, but Mirei pointed out to him that there wouldn't be enough, just for her and Nana. But, there was also a delicious pastry stick on hand too, and she offered to break her half in half so that Bryn could have a treat too. She's quick with her answers and Bryn and I often share a look at something she has come up with so fast and with such clear reasoning. </p>
<p>She and I put the last of the stickers in the "Angelina, Ballerina" book that we started on Saturday, and then Mirei read to me from "Ten Apples up on Top" once more. We read two more pages, with new words for her, and will practice again tomorrow.                              </p>
<p>Bryn took Riku off on the bike for his 5 P.M. karate lesson, and then picked him up again at 6:30. I had promised Riku I would wait and have dinner with him; Akane and Mirei eat earlier so that Mirei can get her tub time in and in bed at her usual time. It was the first time I saw Riku in his karate uniform and wearing his orange belt; I must say he looked very handsome. We sat at the table eating our late dinner, and looking at a book while we did so, not something that happens when we all eat together. </p>
<p>Riku was anxious to read as much of "Captain Underpants" as he could, and Mirei decided she wanted her mom to tuck her in tonight. Riku was very happy about that and at 8 P.M. we were under the covers and read two chapters of his book. </p>
<p>That was it for me for the night too, much to my surprise!  I dozed off, happily as warm as could be.</p>
