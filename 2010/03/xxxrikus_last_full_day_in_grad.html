								<h2>Riku's Last Full Day in Grade One, and Go Fish!</h2>
								<p>Riku has either shortened days, or days off school, until the term ends next Wednesday, and he knew he would be bringing home all of his art work. I teased him and told him I would meet him with a small truck after school today, but he came running up to meet me, coat a-flying, big smiles, and carrying a decorated (by him) flat cardboard case with a handle on it ... very efficient and easy to carry. </p>
<p>It was a chilly walk to and from school today; the temperature has dropped again, although it is clear and sunny, just nippy. </p>
<p>Wednesday is Riku's "free" day, with no extracurricular activities, so after he had done his piano practice, and Mirei hers, we all sat on the heated floor mat and watched a good part of "Charlotte's Web" together. Both children read to me too, and Riku finished up his wee bit of homework before Akane left for her weekly French class.</p>
<p>Mirei and I played our first game of "Go Fish" tonight, by asking each other about colours in a random deck of cards. She caught on immediately, carefully placing her pairs together neatly... the better to count them, my dear, as she won both games! It was lots of fun and we will play this a lot over the next ten days I bet.</p>
<p>Bryn made his delicious Spanish omelette for our dinner tonight,  served with steamed broccoli and carrots on the side, and some cucumber slices too. We had a "picnic" on the rug in the living room since Bryn spent most of the day clearing out a piece of furniture in the dining room where games, puzzles, art supplies, stickers, videos, etc. are stored. There was no room at the table for the four of us, so this was a fun change for us. </p>
<p>Riku is using some very grown-up expressions right now, and Bryn and I often find ourselves raising our eyebrows at each other. "Yeah, whatever Dad" said tongue in cheek for sure, "sure Dad" said casually, but with <strong>his</strong> eyebrows raised for effect, and that sort of thing. Hard to keep track of them all, but he's a-changing. </p>
<p>Mirei has a very sure sense of what is right and wrong, what is funny or sad, and what is mean and kind. She speaks right up and I can only imagine how well this sense of what should be, of what is just, will form her as an adult, with justice for all as far as she is concerned. </p>
<p>Last night when we were watching the movie, there is a part where Wilbur the pig realizes he is going to be killed and eaten. The goose doesn't realize that this is also his fate, but Riku got that, and laughed. Mirei spoke right up, saying "Riku! That is not funny. That is sad!" and she was very serious about it. </p>
<p>Riku didn't have dessert last night; he chose not to, but somehow Mirei thought that her dad wasn't allowing him to. So, when Riku was reading to me, she scooted off her chair, came over with a section of string cheese for him, whispered that it was for him 'cause he didn't have dessert, and put her finger across her mouth, saying "shhhh" before heading back to the table. </p>
<p>Riku had a quick shower, and is now washing his own hair and hopping in and out of the tub by himself. Whenever I ask if he wants me to check to see if the shampoo is all out, the answer is, "Don't worry. I've got it Nana." </p>
<p>Bryn went up with Mirei to tuck her in, and read three stories tonight! Riku was asleep by 7:50, and Bryn never did appear for the rest of the evening. No sake for me tonight; I didn't feel like drinking alone.  :) </p>
