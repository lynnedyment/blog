								<h2>Four Day Weekend Begins</h2>
								<p>... for Riku. He had today off school, although was given six pages of homework to do as it's not a holiday, just time away from school while a graduation ceremony is held for the grade six classes today. </p>
<p>I was taking Mirei to school this morning and at the last minute Riku decided he would come with us on the bus. It was a bit of a dash, and we ran most of the way to the bus stop, arriving with about thirty seconds to spare. Whew! Riku and Mirei wanted to sit beside each other and it was fun watching them work a maze book together, and chat away. </p>
<p>Mirei was just adorable at school, proudly tapping classmates on the shoulder, and then sweeping her arm toward Riku when they turned around, pointing out Riku to them, with the biggest smile on her face. She even got to show him off to her teacher, which made her especially happy. </p>
<p>Riku spent the morning with me, working away on one of his sheets of work with a break to do something fun in between. He's a whiz at math and it didn't take him long to go through the 84 addition and subtraction questions on each of four of the sheets, although he wasn't always happy about having to do them. A snack, a bit of tv, and some iPhone games were his rewards. </p>
<p>He was supposed to practice jump roping too, and so we went outside so he had company while he skipped. I had no idea Riku could skip at all, and thought we were going out for him to learn how to do it, so I was very happy to see him jumping while running ten or more times, but not, of course, when I was taping him! Akane and I both did a little skipping too. I have a feeling when I come back next year Riku will be skipping very well, as it's something they seem to do now in schools, both here and in San Francisco. </p>
<p>We walked up to the playground where he did some more skipping in a larger area, and played with some local boys who were gathered there, boys from school, but not in his class, and from his karate class. He was happy though to come back and join me, where I sat in the sunshine, and chat while he skipped some more. </p>
