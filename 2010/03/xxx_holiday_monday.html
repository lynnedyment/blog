								<h2>Holiday Monday</h2>
								<p>Holiday or not, Riku was out of bed at 6:30 on the dot, but this morning Riku pulled the covers up over my shoulders and kissed the top of my head before sliding the door shut. Usually he leaves it open as he wants me up asap; it was sweet and I snuggled in for an extra five minutes before joining him in the dining room. </p>
<p>The children had a great holiday; it was fun from morning until night for them, with lots of time for playing. Ayako and Akane went out during the morning and early afternoon, and while they were gone I watched a movie with the children, sat with Riku while he read his chapter, while Mirei read to Bryn, and later on I read to Mirei. She and Riku spent lots of time upstairs playing together, and playing pirates and "bad guys" down here with Bryn and me. Mirei was in an adorable costume and looked like a Spanish se√±orita in black and red... or as Bryn and I decided later, a dance hall girl! </p>
<p>Bryn continued on with his cleaning and purging project, this time working away in the kitchen. My intention was to spend more time with Riku going through his room, but the children played happily together and the time flew by. </p>
<p>Once Akane and Ayako came home, I left for a one-and-a-half-hour walk. It was quite mild out, despite the house feeling much colder today, and I meandered up to the area that Bryn and I explored last week. </p>
<p>I headed uphill, walked alongside a bamboo forested area, and spent a long time in a cemetery built on a hill, with many levels of concrete and stone headstones, some very simple and some very elaborate. There were many people in the cemetery sweeping, clearing out weeds, leaving biscuits and fruit on the base of the stones; the smell of incense was in the air. </p>
<p>I took lots of photos before leaving and walking downhill, stopping to snap more photos of homes, large and small, before heading heading home again. </p>
<p>I stopped in at the Karan bakery, where Akane had bought Bryn's delicious chocolate cake. I have been in three times now, just to look at the lovely pastries, but have never bought anything, but today ran into Ayako who had stopped on her way back to Sakai to pick up some treats for Masu. </p>
<p>The children continued to keep themselves busy, spent quite a bit of time playing outside together. When I came back from my walk, Mirei was out there on her own, with a pad of paper, writing a "letter" for me; she proudly presented me it to me later on, after she had coloured all the hearts on it pink. They came in while dinner was being made and had a long fun bath together. </p>
<p>While the children were finishing up their dinners, Riku suggested we play a game together. He decided we should name our favourites of various things ... dinner, dessert, fruit, drink, number, colour, etc. It was fun with Bryn and Akane joining in too, and led to some interesting discussions. Mirei was hilarious and took her turn very seriously, insisting that she follow Riku and obviously thinking about her answers. </p>
<p>Here are a few of them: Favourite food? Riku - sushi, Mirei - pizza, me - tofu, Bryn - pizza, and Akane - sushi. Fruit? Riku - pear(!) (not strawberries, much to my surprise!), Mirei - mango! (another surprise answer), me - cherries, Bryn - a really good orange, Akane - mango stem. </p>
<p>The children had a little more time together after dinner too. Mirei put on her coat for some reason, as this is a child who never needs a second layer on! Funny little girl... </p>
<p>Riku was heading into bed at 7:20 and had been promised two stories because it was nice and early. We are reading a "classic" series written in comic book form by Hathway, The Brothers Grimm, and Aesop's Fables, and I was taking some time tonight to explain a few things to Riku. About half way through the first book ("Johnny Appleseed")  Riku suggested that maybe I should just keep reading, and read fast, because we had to read another book ("The Magic Pitcher"). He was yawning, and so was I, so read I did!</p>
<p>I finished off my John Steinbeck book, chose photos from Bryn's computer and wrote some emails on Akane's, while she and Bryn sorted through some containers together. I got lots done and went off to bed before 11 P.M.</p>
