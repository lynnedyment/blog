								<h2>Mirei's Turn!</h2>
								<p>A few days ago, Mirei realized that I was spending far too much time taking Riku to school, and not her, and I've been hearing "No fair!" So today she and I set off for her school, while Bryn walked Riku to his school. Mirei is a fun little companion; we strolled/ran, ran, ran/strolled to the bus stop, and she chattered all the way there, looking out the window and asking lots of questions. There were a couple of children from her school on the bus too, so as we got closer to her stop, she was happy to stand next to them, saying hello in French to them all. We had taken an earlier bus than would have been ideal as we had more than ten minutes to wait before Mirei could go into her classroom. We found a pair of chairs, and sat working our way through a couple of maze puzzles. </p>
<p>I did some packing up this morning, as Bryn and Akane have some things for me to take back to SF with me, to give away: children's toys, clothes, and a few household items. I caught up on some emails and read the morning away.</p>
<p>I picked Riku up from school as usual; today he told me that each child had to make a card for two children who won't be at the school next year. One is a boy who is moving to Tokyo. He has had some fun times with this boy, but decided at some point fairly recently that he thinks he is a "mean boy". He wasn't happy about having to make a card for him, and wished he hadn't had to make it. Riku felt quite strongly about it, saying he hadn't done a good job on it, and wished too that he could have said he was happy he was leaving. We had a long discussion about how this all felt, and that one of the good things about being a grown-up was not having to do that kind of thing, but learning how to ignore people we don't like, while still being polite. </p>
<p>Riku had his busy Thursday routine with piano practice and homework before karate class.</p>
<p>I left the house at 3:15 to meet Mirei at school, and was greeted with her usual big sunny smile. After taking her photo in a local phone booth, where she posed happily for me, we bought her a muffin at the local bakery. There are no afternoon snacks at French school, so she is always ready for a big snack. The muffin and a bag of pistachios kept her tummy filled until she got home. <br />
 <br />
At home we played another game of "Go Fish", which she won again! She was a busy girl,  playing with a Lego house Riku had built with her Lego pieces, and the white mouse puppet Jody had bought for Riku when he was a little fellow. She had him picking up Lego pieces to play with her, and insisted that I take her photo with him/her. We had lots of time together today! </p>
<p>The other day I told Mirei I just had to grab my coat to go somewhere, and she called out "How about your camera?" So many photo opportunities not to be missed! After dinner with Akane, Mirei whipped up "a strawberry white cake with icing on it" in the tub for me. She really likes cooking while bathing and whips up lots of goodies while soaking in the deep tub. </p>
<p>Late dinner together with Riku, and lots of computer time while Akane watched a longer than usual TV special.</p>
