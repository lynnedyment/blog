								<h2>Sunday Visitor and Lots to Do!</h2>
								<p>The children were unaware last night at bedtime that their Auntie Ayako (Aka-chan), would be here this morning, and they were just delighted when they found out. Riku and I had our usual quiet early morning time together, arising at our usual 6:30 A.M.and once Ayako was up had lots of time with Ayako and Mirei. </p>
<p>The day was busy, with lots of activities: all three of them watched part of the Durimon movie with Ayako, then Riku had her to himself for a bit, starting a science experiment while Mirei did her piano practice. Mirei and I had been playing with the Play-Doh, and then I had fun watching Mirei with Ayako, as they made pizzas and iPhones with it too! I got a cute photo of Mirei showing hers off to her dad. At one point, Akane, Ayako, and the children were involved in the experiment, making crystals grow. Stay tuned: that happens next weekend! </p>
<p>I made "creamy" mac' and cheese for lunch, one of Riku's favourite dishes in SF, and here too, as a big bowl was gone in no time flat! I am hoping the cheddar cheese Bryn had me bring lasts long enough for one more meal of it for them. </p>
<p>Mirei went off for three hours with her French teacher this afternoon, instead of the usual morning lesson, while Akane and Ayako ran some errands. Bryn was continuing on with his cleaning and purging home project, so Riku and I went up to do the same in his room. Riku has no trouble at all getting rid of things he no longer uses; he is ruthless, and doesn't even hesitate, so I easily filled a bag full of toys. I have a feeling it won't be this easy if I get to do this with Mirei's side of the room! </p>
<p>Mirei read to Bryn tonight from "Ten Apples up on Top";  I did a little recording, but always seem to get her when she is being especially silly. However, she is close to finishing off the book completely on her own, and Riku and I read another chapter in his ongoing English book too. Busy day in all! </p>
<p>Akane cooked up a special meal (while Riki and I did a 100-piece puzzle) ... one she had promised Riku that she would make this weekend. The other three adults were going out for a late dinner, so it was all for the children and me. </p>
<p>While Riku and I were upstairs today, the farmer's wife came over with the promised seasonal greens, and so there was a wonderful assortment of vegetables grilled at the table ... the greens, with tiny yellow flowers, mushrooms, kabocha squash, sliced very thinly, as well as carrots, onions, and cabbage, along with a bowl of rice for each of us. While Akane cooked the thin slices of meat and sausages for the children in the kitchen (usually done on the grill as well), Bryn tended to the veggies and I ate my full of it all. Yum! </p>
<p>It was a fun dinner as Bryn and I told stories and sang songs from our childhoods ... Bryn remembered the song his Grandma Dyment sang to his dad: "I know a little boy, sly and deceitful ..." which Mirei heard for the first time the other day on the bus and thought was very mean. It is. And Riku has heard at least one of my family stories often enough that he knows that if I, or any of my siblings, laughed at the dinner table — silly, out of control laughing, the way Mirei was laughing tonight — that we got to sit on the dark basement steps. Mirei insisted on telling stories from her childhood too, usually involving lots of tales of her gurgling and gooing, and her dad baby-talking to her. She kept track of just whose turn it was to tell a tale too. </p>
<p>Quiet productive evening on my own, as the children were asleep by 8:15, Akane, Ayako, and Bryn left for dinner, and I got a few emails written and went through photos from the last couple of days. </p>
<p>At tuck-in time, Riku counted how many nights we have left together: ten. He thinks that sounds like a lot, but I know how very quickly they will pass. </p>
<p>Doug arrived home from England today after a very busy fun eleven day trip there. I'm looking forward to hearing all the stories, and seeing his photos when I get home. </p>
<p>P.S. Late this afternoon, Riku was leading an "exercise class" with Mirei his only student. They were leaning over sideways, stretching out their arms, and Bryn decided to join them. Mirei told him he couldn't because Riku was the teacher and she was the girl. Bryn suggested that he could be "the boy" but Mirei gave him a little push, telling him "No! I am the girl and you are too big!"</p>
