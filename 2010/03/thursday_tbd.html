								<h2>Drizzly Busy Thursday</h2>
								<p>Riku has a morning routine that suits him to a "t". He wakens about 6:30, turns on the heat in the living room, and then sits at the computer until 7 o'clock playing or watching some form of a Mario set. Bryn is downstairs by that time, and if I haven't made the children's fruit bowls, Bryn does so, and continues on making breakfast. That's my time to shower, so that I can sit with the children while they eat, sometimes reading them a story.</p>
<p>A young girl walked part of the way to school with us today, asking Riku questions about who I was and where I came from. She was very curious and pushed for more detail than Riku normally would have given her. At one point another little girl joined us too, so I took a photo of the trio.</p>
<p>It's grey and drizzly again today, good for all the gardens and plants. I snapped a photo of some spring flowers as Candy had mentioned that her daffodils were coming up in Kanata. There are lots of pansies in pots on doorsteps right now, and flowering cabbage too. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn went out together for a few hours, and I spent most of the time writing emails and working on adding lots of family photos that I discovered from another person researching the same line. So exciting! </p>
<p>I left at 2:40 to pick Riku up from school, and at 3:30 headed off with Bryn by bus to pick Mirei up from the Japanese nursery school she has been attending for two weeks.</p>
<p>Mirei is always ready for a snack at the end of her school day and luckily there is a very nice bakery just a block away; she was a tired girl too, so her dad gave her a shoulder ride. After checking everything out carefully, she chose an unfilled doughnut, with sugar sprinkled on top. After three bites she had had enough, and her dad got to finish it off later on. He said it was delicious and chewy and Akane said that particular bakery is known for its doughnuts. </p>
<p>Back at home, both Riku and Mirei had homework to do. Riku got his out of the way before his karate class, and while he was gone Mirei did hers... it was for her music class, and she was very meticulous and careful with it. She has very good hand control for such a little girl. It was fun to watch her working away with that head down over her paper.</p>
<p>It was still drizzling at 6:20 when I left to walk to Riku's karate class, about a ten minute walk away. I knew that Riku ended the class with some sort of an English command, and I got to hear his voice coming across so clearly, even from outside the closed door. Riku told me later that they had a new teacher who told him that since his English was the best he could keep doing it. I felt a bit self-conscious about going in to watch, but shall do so next time, as Bryn assured me it was fine. </p>
<p>The mother of a classmate, a young girl who goes to Riku's grade school as well, offered us a ride home, but Riku told me he thought we should walk and get some fresh air, so we did so. </p>
<p>Back at home, the two of us had dinner together, and then it was a quick shower for Riku and tuck in time, after hugs and kisses from Mirei, who said she missed us when we were gone. </p>
