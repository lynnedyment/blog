								<h2><a href="/2010/02/san_francisco_to_kyoto.html">San Francisco to Kyoto (two days in one)</a></h2>
								<p>Highlights of the day:</p>
<p>Flight: left at noon, lucked out with a window seat with lots of leg room, despite not having been able to book a seat ahead of time. There was lots of turbulence for the first two hours, I read, did some Sudoku, talked with the man beside me,  and landed exactly eleven hours and ten minutes after take-off. </p>
<p>Food:  no veggie meal saved for me. Great steward made me up a yummy dish of rice, edamame, grated carrot, patty-pan squash, delicious tiny grilled zucchini, plus a green salad and roll while I waited for my "special" meal. Snack of sun chips, mini chocolate bar, and pretzels. Hot meal before landing... fruit compote plus a pasta and tomato sauce dish. I'm always hungry when flying, or driving too, for that matter, so eat everything that is offered to me. </p>
<p>Weather: pouring down rain and mild. This makes me happy. I don't want it to be cold this month. Fingers crossed. </p>
<p>Transportation: Akane had booked me in with a shuttle service. Had to wait a half hour for two other passengers. I was the last person dropped off in this northern part of the city and I kept checking my watch, hoping I would arrive before Mirei went to bed. </p>
<p>Time: Arrived at the house at 7:40 P.M., a two and a half hour trip from door to door. Body time when I went to bed was 5 A.M. on Saturday, for a total of 47 hours from bed to bed. </p>
<p>Mirei: Riku was expecting me tonight, but Mirei had been told it would be tomorrow morning, just in case I arrived after her bedtime. She ran to me when I opened the door to the living room, and looked so big! She has grown a lot in all directions! I got big hugs and lots of attention while Riku was finishing up his tub routine. A <strong>huge</strong>, Mirei sat beside me on the sofa, reading for the very first time to me ever from "Ten Apples up on Top", all the way to page 41! Bryn had told her what my reaction to her reading to me would be and he was right on. Once I realized she was truly reading and not just reciting the words to me, I was flabbergasted, and Mirei was delighted that I was so pleased with this new skill. She and Bryn had started this learning process just after Christmas and Auntie Kelly was in on the secret. </p>
<p>Riku: Once Mirei was off for her tub, Riku snuggled up very close to me on the sofa while chatting about all the great new things we can do if we go to Sakai (which isn't likely) as he wants me to play Wii with him so badly. He filled me in all the games he thought would be too hard for me... lots of them... and the ones he was sure I could manage. He reminds me so much of his cousin Bryn at this age, as I also got filled in, with great detail, about the games he plays on his dad's iPhone. Riku is a gamer! </p>
<p>Riku said to me several times "Is it really <strong>you</strong>, Nana?"  </p>
<p>Extra Bonus! Riku told Bryn he wished that he could sleep with me, and Bryn told him it was up to me. Now Mirei is old enough to make her wishes known too, and so there was a discussion about taking turns, with Riku in with me tonight, and Mirei the next night. All happy. </p>
<p>Finishing up... got the two checked bags completely unpacked and put away... freezer foods and food stuffs, my clothes, gifts, books, and the various things that Akane and Bryn had ordered/asked for. Quickly checked my email. Dug out my book. </p>
<p>Bedtime with a heated "bed buddy" brought from home. </p>
<p>P.S. Timewise this entry should have ended when I was waiting for my bags and clearing customs in Osaka, but it's easier to treat it all as one day and start fresh tomorrow.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/02/jet_lagged_in_kyoto.html">Jet-Lagged in Kyoto</a></h2>
								<p>Riku awoke at 6:30 this morning, bursting to fill me in on more information on Mario and friends. He had a magazine filled with all the various characters and was busy making sure I understood who the bad and good guys were and what I had to be careful about when dealing with each one of them. </p>
<p>Mirei eventually joined us and they brought in the gifts that Susan had sent with me for them, opening them and then playing with the most fantastic little moving bugs on a track. </p>
<p>Mirei was having a visitor today, from 9–3, so we had to get on with our morning. I showered and joined them at the breakfast table, and the day flew by in a jet-lagged haze. Kako, the five year old girl from Mirei's French program was busy and active, and the girls, and Riku too, kept busy upstairs playing for the longest time. </p>
<p>I was cold and was happy to huddle up in the corner of the sofa, reading. Mirei noticed I was cold, despite having Bryn's big wooly sweater covering my knees, and touched my heart by going upstairs for her pink patchwork quilt, and covering me carefully with it. At one point I dozed off and Mirei sat next to me, rubbing my forehead and running her fingers through my hair. Earlier in the day she had remembered that when I had fallen here and was unable to dress myself, she had helped me put my socks on. Such a nurturer is this little girl! </p>
<p>Riku and I read a couple of books and he would snuggle in next to me every once in a while, for a little chat — he has this sweet habit of putting his hands on either side of my face . I read, dozed a bit, and watched the children playing, taking a few photos now and then. </p>
<p>Riku was anxious for me to hear him play the piano so off we went upstairs where he amazed me with his heartfelt pleasure in his own playing. His body moves as his fingers work their way up and down the keys, he smiles as he plays, and he was obviously pleased that I enjoyed listening to him. He played two pieces, one of which he will play in his first recital next week, and then he played a third piece with the "weird" button pushed that makes it sound "creepy" and certainly more interesting to his ears apparently.</p>
<p>At 1 o'clock his Chinese tutor, Han Lau-shi, arrived for a three-hour play session with him. They went up to Riku's room to play and it was obvious that they were having a great time together, as I could hear Riku laughing out loud enjoying it all. </p>
<p>The girls sat at the table playing with two different shades of new pink Play-Doh I had brought with me, along with rolling pins and cutters. Earlier they had both dressed up in princess dresses and looked just adorable together. </p>
<p>It was close to four o'clock before Kako left, and our two were ready for some quiet time; they sat together on a heated floor mat(!), and watched part of a new French DVD. </p>
<p>It was a perfect day as I had lots of time with the children around me, but wasn't required to do much active entertaining... just take in how they've changed and enjoy having them right there. </p>
<p>While Akane put together a delicious tempura dinner for us, Mirei sat with me while we read two new stories about "Biscuit" from a new book I had brought for her. She was very quick to point out the works she knows already, but quickly insisted on reading the words "Biscuit" and "woof woof" each time they appeared. </p>
<p>Akane had a large number of veggies for our dinner and my favourite bits  were lotus root, sticks of tofu, and rabe, a member of the broccoli family, but lighter and more tender. I always enjoy the onion/carrot mixture too, though, and always eat a little more than I probably should of everything. </p>
<p>I gave Mirei a quick shower before bedtime, and tucked her into bed in my room after a bedtime story. She was asleep very quickly, which was great, as I got to read part of "Captain Underpants" to Riku, a book he enjoyed as much as "wee" Bryn had at his age, and the reason that I bought it for him. I dozed off with both children for a few minutes, starting to really feel just how tired I was at this point of the day. </p>
<p>Despite that, Bryn somehow (guilt, actually) managed to talk to me into going to a neighbourhood bar with him, about a fifteen-minute walk away. It was 9:30, I was really tired, and I was cold, but off I went with an extra layer and a scarf around my neck. And of course it was just lovely... the walk, checking out some houses along a street I hadn't walked down before, and sitting in a very quiet little bar drinking sake with my son. The bartender didn't have any on hand, but went upstairs to his apartment, and came back down with a brand new bottle. I was surprised at how much he poured into each good-sized glass, and expected to let Bryn finish off 2/3 of mine, but we sat and chatted and I sipped away enjoying this quiet time with Bryn. </p>
<p>Home at 11 o'clock, checked email, but was too tired to respond to any at all, and off I went to bed, surprising myself by reading until midnight.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/02/a_leisurely_sunday_morning_and.html">A Leisurely Sunday Morning and a Dinner Party</a></h2>
								<p>I didn't sleep long enough again last night, so after watching Mirei slowly awaken, and snuggling for a bit with her, I decided I would read a bit in my warm "nest" after she and Riku went off to play. Bryn was up serving them their fruit plate, and it was quite lovely listening to the morning chatter, while I continued on with my book, "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", which I am thoroughly enjoying. </p>
<p>Mirei goes for a three hour "playdate" with her French teacher at his house each Sunday morning, from 9–noon. Bryn suggested that he and I take her today, and leave Akane and Riku to do a bit of homework or piano practice before meeting us at an outdoor market later on. So it was a fast shower for me and a piece of yummy Bryn made for me, before setting off to the bus stop. Mirei took charge of my bus pass, taking her job seriously and showing it to the driver when we got off. </p>
<p>Bryn had Mirei show me where her teacher lives and how to get to his apartment, so she pushed all the right buttons and was just as happy as could be, right up to the moment when he opened the door and said good morning to us all. She didn't want to leave us, but she really likes this teacher and his pregnant wife (Mirei told me on the way that she had a baby inside her), and we learned later that the crying did not last more than one minute. </p>
<p>Bryn suggested that we had time for a quick cup of tea at a small bakery/cafe just down the road. I chose a fresh croissant, and Bryn ordered his coffee and my black tea. Lovely little spot, friendly staff, and the <strong>most</strong> delicious cup of tea I have ever had in a cafe/restaurant. I think it was a combination of being a really good quality tea (a silk teabag), and made with hot milk added to the pot as it brewed. There was also a pitcher of hot milk for Bryn's cafe au lait and my tea; it was just a perfect little treat. </p>
<p>We caught a bus and met up with Akane and Riku at the market at a shrine not too far from their home. The rain had stopped, and I had a great time wandering about, stopping at the stalls that held the bits that were interesting to me... a lovely little cup, with no handle, with a bright green leaf painted in at the bottom, a booth selling buttons made out of bits of carved wood (Riku liked these too), and Riku rushing to get me to the booth selling jam that Akane and Riku had sampled before we arrived. He loved the chunky apple with cinnamon, and I tried a yummy orange spread. Akane bought a jar of the apple jam. </p>
<p>There was a very friendly young woman selling postcards she had drawn herself; they were lovely. The work on most of them was very intricate, with tiny swirls of hand-cut snowflakes, the tiniest little child-like characters, whimsical animals, fruit and vegetables, and all painted in the softest of pastels or the brightest of some of my favourite colours. Riku liked them too, and chose one for me to buy for him. He promised he would send it to me. </p>
<p>Akane bought some yummy rolls ... an onion roll and a plain one for Bryn and me to share, and a bag of crunchy toast like seasoned bread. Riku told me it was yummy and had me take a bite of his; it was spicy and fine... and I learned a few minutes later than it was made with cod roe. They all liked it so much they bought a second bag of it, and Mirei was a fan too when she got to try it later on. </p>
<p>Bryn wanted to sit for a bit, so we found a bench near a small stream. Riku and I went off exploring, we saw a bride and her wedding party having photos taken (but I couldn't get close enough to them quickly enough to get a photo or two), and just meandered here and there. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane took the bus to pick up Mirei,  and Riku and I walked home together; Bryn had told him what landmark to look for... a furniture store on a corner, and he took his job seriously, worrying a bit that we might miss it. He also pointed out a restaurant where he liked the Chinese food and another where they served curry. It was perhaps a forty minute walk home and we had a little time on our own before Akane and Bryn walked in with Mirei.  </p>
<p>The next few hours flew by. Akane made a hot lunch for the children; I curled up on the sofa with the computer, trying to get warm; the children watched part of a video, and then then went off to play together upstairs. </p>
<p>Company was coming for dinner: a couple Akane and Bryn met at Mirei's French school, and their five-year-old son, Makoto, who is one of Mirei's classmates. The wife, Senko, is Japanese and her husband Jerome is French. From the time Jerome was a child he had enjoyed watching Japanese children's tv shows. He decided at that early age that Japan was a better place to live than France based on those shows. </p>
<p>Fortuitously,  he and his Japanese wife met in France, in a class they were both taking. Later he attended the University of Waterloo for a year, so his English is quite good as well. Now he's a game programmer and was very interested in a game Riku plays on Bryn's IPhone; he spent some time looking at one of Riku's action figure catalogues as well.</p>
<p>Bryn had volunteered to make part of the dinner and was making polenta for the first time, with cornmeal I brought with me for them, plus a Spanish omelette he had made once or twice before (with pointers picked up from a video on the Internet). There was also some delicious fried tofu for me, which Akane prepared, and chicken as well. </p>
<p>Dinner was a huge hit and there wasn't a bite left over, much to my surprise, as lots of everything were served. We had a delicious red French wine the guests had brought, and enjoyed the dessert box they had contributed too... I chose creme brulee and enjoyed every bite of it.</p>
<p>The children watched part of a DVD they had brought along, although Makoto was completely taken with Riku's belt with gizmos and a few other of Mirei's and Riku's toys. He's an only child and was happily engaged with the toys, playing on his own, much to Riku's disappointment.</p>
<p>As soon as dinner was over, I got busy with tubs and showers for Riku and Mirei, so they could be in bed close to their regular time. Mirei wanted Akane to tuck her in, which was great, as I was able to read to Riku, leaving him asleep at 8:10.</p>
<p>It was a busy fun day, and Bryn didn't even mind all the cleaning up and dish washing that he did on his own. It was a big job, but he volunteered to do it, and I was happy to let him, while I typed away on his computer.</p>
