								<h2>A Leisurely Sunday Morning and a Dinner Party</h2>
								<p>I didn't sleep long enough again last night, so after watching Mirei slowly awaken, and snuggling for a bit with her, I decided I would read a bit in my warm "nest" after she and Riku went off to play. Bryn was up serving them their fruit plate, and it was quite lovely listening to the morning chatter, while I continued on with my book, "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", which I am thoroughly enjoying. </p>
<p>Mirei goes for a three hour "playdate" with her French teacher at his house each Sunday morning, from 9â€“noon. Bryn suggested that he and I take her today, and leave Akane and Riku to do a bit of homework or piano practice before meeting us at an outdoor market later on. So it was a fast shower for me and a piece of yummy Bryn made for me, before setting off to the bus stop. Mirei took charge of my bus pass, taking her job seriously and showing it to the driver when we got off. </p>
<p>Bryn had Mirei show me where her teacher lives and how to get to his apartment, so she pushed all the right buttons and was just as happy as could be, right up to the moment when he opened the door and said good morning to us all. She didn't want to leave us, but she really likes this teacher and his pregnant wife (Mirei told me on the way that she had a baby inside her), and we learned later that the crying did not last more than one minute. </p>
<p>Bryn suggested that we had time for a quick cup of tea at a small bakery/cafe just down the road. I chose a fresh croissant, and Bryn ordered his coffee and my black tea. Lovely little spot, friendly staff, and the <strong>most</strong> delicious cup of tea I have ever had in a cafe/restaurant. I think it was a combination of being a really good quality tea (a silk teabag), and made with hot milk added to the pot as it brewed. There was also a pitcher of hot milk for Bryn's cafe au lait and my tea; it was just a perfect little treat. </p>
<p>We caught a bus and met up with Akane and Riku at the market at a shrine not too far from their home. The rain had stopped, and I had a great time wandering about, stopping at the stalls that held the bits that were interesting to me... a lovely little cup, with no handle, with a bright green leaf painted in at the bottom, a booth selling buttons made out of bits of carved wood (Riku liked these too), and Riku rushing to get me to the booth selling jam that Akane and Riku had sampled before we arrived. He loved the chunky apple with cinnamon, and I tried a yummy orange spread. Akane bought a jar of the apple jam. </p>
<p>There was a very friendly young woman selling postcards she had drawn herself; they were lovely. The work on most of them was very intricate, with tiny swirls of hand-cut snowflakes, the tiniest little child-like characters, whimsical animals, fruit and vegetables, and all painted in the softest of pastels or the brightest of some of my favourite colours. Riku liked them too, and chose one for me to buy for him. He promised he would send it to me. </p>
<p>Akane bought some yummy rolls ... an onion roll and a plain one for Bryn and me to share, and a bag of crunchy toast like seasoned bread. Riku told me it was yummy and had me take a bite of his; it was spicy and fine... and I learned a few minutes later than it was made with cod roe. They all liked it so much they bought a second bag of it, and Mirei was a fan too when she got to try it later on. </p>
<p>Bryn wanted to sit for a bit, so we found a bench near a small stream. Riku and I went off exploring, we saw a bride and her wedding party having photos taken (but I couldn't get close enough to them quickly enough to get a photo or two), and just meandered here and there. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane took the bus to pick up Mirei,  and Riku and I walked home together; Bryn had told him what landmark to look for... a furniture store on a corner, and he took his job seriously, worrying a bit that we might miss it. He also pointed out a restaurant where he liked the Chinese food and another where they served curry. It was perhaps a forty minute walk home and we had a little time on our own before Akane and Bryn walked in with Mirei.  </p>
<p>The next few hours flew by. Akane made a hot lunch for the children; I curled up on the sofa with the computer, trying to get warm; the children watched part of a video, and then then went off to play together upstairs. </p>
<p>Company was coming for dinner: a couple Akane and Bryn met at Mirei's French school, and their five-year-old son, Makoto, who is one of Mirei's classmates. The wife, Senko, is Japanese and her husband Jerome is French. From the time Jerome was a child he had enjoyed watching Japanese children's tv shows. He decided at that early age that Japan was a better place to live than France based on those shows. </p>
<p>Fortuitously,  he and his Japanese wife met in France, in a class they were both taking. Later he attended the University of Waterloo for a year, so his English is quite good as well. Now he's a game programmer and was very interested in a game Riku plays on Bryn's IPhone; he spent some time looking at one of Riku's action figure catalogues as well.</p>
<p>Bryn had volunteered to make part of the dinner and was making polenta for the first time, with cornmeal I brought with me for them, plus a Spanish omelette he had made once or twice before (with pointers picked up from a video on the Internet). There was also some delicious fried tofu for me, which Akane prepared, and chicken as well. </p>
<p>Dinner was a huge hit and there wasn't a bite left over, much to my surprise, as lots of everything were served. We had a delicious red French wine the guests had brought, and enjoyed the dessert box they had contributed too... I chose creme brulee and enjoyed every bite of it.</p>
<p>The children watched part of a DVD they had brought along, although Makoto was completely taken with Riku's belt with gizmos and a few other of Mirei's and Riku's toys. He's an only child and was happily engaged with the toys, playing on his own, much to Riku's disappointment.</p>
<p>As soon as dinner was over, I got busy with tubs and showers for Riku and Mirei, so they could be in bed close to their regular time. Mirei wanted Akane to tuck her in, which was great, as I was able to read to Riku, leaving him asleep at 8:10.</p>
<p>It was a busy fun day, and Bryn didn't even mind all the cleaning up and dish washing that he did on his own. It was a big job, but he volunteered to do it, and I was happy to let him, while I typed away on his computer.</p>
