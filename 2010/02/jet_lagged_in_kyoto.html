								<h2>Jet-Lagged in Kyoto</h2>
								<p>Riku awoke at 6:30 this morning, bursting to fill me in on more information on Mario and friends. He had a magazine filled with all the various characters and was busy making sure I understood who the bad and good guys were and what I had to be careful about when dealing with each one of them. </p>
<p>Mirei eventually joined us and they brought in the gifts that Susan had sent with me for them, opening them and then playing with the most fantastic little moving bugs on a track. </p>
<p>Mirei was having a visitor today, from 9–3, so we had to get on with our morning. I showered and joined them at the breakfast table, and the day flew by in a jet-lagged haze. Kako, the five year old girl from Mirei's French program was busy and active, and the girls, and Riku too, kept busy upstairs playing for the longest time. </p>
<p>I was cold and was happy to huddle up in the corner of the sofa, reading. Mirei noticed I was cold, despite having Bryn's big wooly sweater covering my knees, and touched my heart by going upstairs for her pink patchwork quilt, and covering me carefully with it. At one point I dozed off and Mirei sat next to me, rubbing my forehead and running her fingers through my hair. Earlier in the day she had remembered that when I had fallen here and was unable to dress myself, she had helped me put my socks on. Such a nurturer is this little girl! </p>
<p>Riku and I read a couple of books and he would snuggle in next to me every once in a while, for a little chat — he has this sweet habit of putting his hands on either side of my face . I read, dozed a bit, and watched the children playing, taking a few photos now and then. </p>
<p>Riku was anxious for me to hear him play the piano so off we went upstairs where he amazed me with his heartfelt pleasure in his own playing. His body moves as his fingers work their way up and down the keys, he smiles as he plays, and he was obviously pleased that I enjoyed listening to him. He played two pieces, one of which he will play in his first recital next week, and then he played a third piece with the "weird" button pushed that makes it sound "creepy" and certainly more interesting to his ears apparently.</p>
<p>At 1 o'clock his Chinese tutor, Han Lau-shi, arrived for a three-hour play session with him. They went up to Riku's room to play and it was obvious that they were having a great time together, as I could hear Riku laughing out loud enjoying it all. </p>
<p>The girls sat at the table playing with two different shades of new pink Play-Doh I had brought with me, along with rolling pins and cutters. Earlier they had both dressed up in princess dresses and looked just adorable together. </p>
<p>It was close to four o'clock before Kako left, and our two were ready for some quiet time; they sat together on a heated floor mat(!), and watched part of a new French DVD. </p>
<p>It was a perfect day as I had lots of time with the children around me, but wasn't required to do much active entertaining... just take in how they've changed and enjoy having them right there. </p>
<p>While Akane put together a delicious tempura dinner for us, Mirei sat with me while we read two new stories about "Biscuit" from a new book I had brought for her. She was very quick to point out the works she knows already, but quickly insisted on reading the words "Biscuit" and "woof woof" each time they appeared. </p>
<p>Akane had a large number of veggies for our dinner and my favourite bits  were lotus root, sticks of tofu, and rabe, a member of the broccoli family, but lighter and more tender. I always enjoy the onion/carrot mixture too, though, and always eat a little more than I probably should of everything. </p>
<p>I gave Mirei a quick shower before bedtime, and tucked her into bed in my room after a bedtime story. She was asleep very quickly, which was great, as I got to read part of "Captain Underpants" to Riku, a book he enjoyed as much as "wee" Bryn had at his age, and the reason that I bought it for him. I dozed off with both children for a few minutes, starting to really feel just how tired I was at this point of the day. </p>
<p>Despite that, Bryn somehow (guilt, actually) managed to talk to me into going to a neighbourhood bar with him, about a fifteen-minute walk away. It was 9:30, I was really tired, and I was cold, but off I went with an extra layer and a scarf around my neck. And of course it was just lovely... the walk, checking out some houses along a street I hadn't walked down before, and sitting in a very quiet little bar drinking sake with my son. The bartender didn't have any on hand, but went upstairs to his apartment, and came back down with a brand new bottle. I was surprised at how much he poured into each good-sized glass, and expected to let Bryn finish off 2/3 of mine, but we sat and chatted and I sipped away enjoying this quiet time with Bryn. </p>
<p>Home at 11 o'clock, checked email, but was too tired to respond to any at all, and off I went to bed, surprising myself by reading until midnight.</p>
