								<h2>San Francisco to Kyoto (two days in one)</h2>
								<p>Highlights of the day:</p>
<p>Flight: left at noon, lucked out with a window seat with lots of leg room, despite not having been able to book a seat ahead of time. There was lots of turbulence for the first two hours, I read, did some Sudoku, talked with the man beside me,  and landed exactly eleven hours and ten minutes after take-off. </p>
<p>Food:  no veggie meal saved for me. Great steward made me up a yummy dish of rice, edamame, grated carrot, patty-pan squash, delicious tiny grilled zucchini, plus a green salad and roll while I waited for my "special" meal. Snack of sun chips, mini chocolate bar, and pretzels. Hot meal before landing... fruit compote plus a pasta and tomato sauce dish. I'm always hungry when flying, or driving too, for that matter, so eat everything that is offered to me. </p>
<p>Weather: pouring down rain and mild. This makes me happy. I don't want it to be cold this month. Fingers crossed. </p>
<p>Transportation: Akane had booked me in with a shuttle service. Had to wait a half hour for two other passengers. I was the last person dropped off in this northern part of the city and I kept checking my watch, hoping I would arrive before Mirei went to bed. </p>
<p>Time: Arrived at the house at 7:40 P.M., a two and a half hour trip from door to door. Body time when I went to bed was 5 A.M. on Saturday, for a total of 47 hours from bed to bed. </p>
<p>Mirei: Riku was expecting me tonight, but Mirei had been told it would be tomorrow morning, just in case I arrived after her bedtime. She ran to me when I opened the door to the living room, and looked so big! She has grown a lot in all directions! I got big hugs and lots of attention while Riku was finishing up his tub routine. A <strong>huge</strong>, Mirei sat beside me on the sofa, reading for the very first time to me ever from "Ten Apples up on Top", all the way to page 41! Bryn had told her what my reaction to her reading to me would be and he was right on. Once I realized she was truly reading and not just reciting the words to me, I was flabbergasted, and Mirei was delighted that I was so pleased with this new skill. She and Bryn had started this learning process just after Christmas and Auntie Kelly was in on the secret. </p>
<p>Riku: Once Mirei was off for her tub, Riku snuggled up very close to me on the sofa while chatting about all the great new things we can do if we go to Sakai (which isn't likely) as he wants me to play Wii with him so badly. He filled me in all the games he thought would be too hard for me... lots of them... and the ones he was sure I could manage. He reminds me so much of his cousin Bryn at this age, as I also got filled in, with great detail, about the games he plays on his dad's iPhone. Riku is a gamer! </p>
<p>Riku said to me several times "Is it really <strong>you</strong>, Nana?"  </p>
<p>Extra Bonus! Riku told Bryn he wished that he could sleep with me, and Bryn told him it was up to me. Now Mirei is old enough to make her wishes known too, and so there was a discussion about taking turns, with Riku in with me tonight, and Mirei the next night. All happy. </p>
<p>Finishing up... got the two checked bags completely unpacked and put away... freezer foods and food stuffs, my clothes, gifts, books, and the various things that Akane and Bryn had ordered/asked for. Quickly checked my email. Dug out my book. </p>
<p>Bedtime with a heated "bed buddy" brought from home. </p>
<p>P.S. Timewise this entry should have ended when I was waiting for my bags and clearing customs in Osaka, but it's easier to treat it all as one day and start fresh tomorrow.</p>
