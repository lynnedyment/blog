								<h2>Mirei's After-School Snacks</h2>
								<p>This morning, as we sat at the breakfast table, I asked Mirei what snack she would like to have after school. She is a hungry girl at 4 P.M. and is ready to eat the minute we get settled on the bus. (The Japanese do not eat on the bus, but we try to be very surreptitious about it. Another classmate does the same ... shhhh.) </p>
<p>I have been picking Mirei up almost every day since I arrived over three weeks ago, and commonly take along a small nectarine, pistachios in the shell, a mixed bag of unsalted nuts and seeds — cashews, Brazil nuts, pine nuts, sunflower seeds, almonds, etc. — that I brought from home. Once or twice a week we stop at a small French bakery on the corner just before the bus stop and Mirei chooses a cheese bun, a small round of pizza, or a sweet bun filled with custard. Only once have we gone into the corner store where there are more snacky "junk food" treats. </p>
<p>Mirei's answer today, and one that made us all laugh out loud, was "Something not healthy."!  </p>
<p>The interesting thing is that Mirei has quite enjoyed sharing these healthy snacks with her friend Naomi and her eight-year-old brother, and it is obvious that they are very pleased to be getting them! Naomi's mom apologized the other day for giving Mirei chocolate biscuits and the long chocolate "straws", which Naomi happily shared with Mirei. Of course I don't mind at all if Mirei eats them as she always chooses to have her orange and a big drink of her barley "tea", the traditional drink in Japan for children and adults too. </p>
<p>Yesterday Naomi's mom had brought along a package of walnuts, newly purchased, as well as a sturdy-looking bread or cake, both of which Mirei refused. There was no way the mom could have known that Mirei doesn't care for walnuts and her cakes have to be quite decadent looking, with cream and/or icing, and lots of it! </p>
<p>I had brought along a package of "kettle corn" from home, as a treat for the children, so had decided this was the day for it ... the "not something healthy" that Mirei had requested. It was a huge hit! Mirei happily shared one piece at a time with the children and never took more than that at her turn either. I don't think she minded that there was some left over when it was their time to get off the bus though. It was a modest amount, and so Mirei asked for her orange as soon as the little bag was empty. I know it was the perfect choice for this day. :) </p>
