								<h2>Oranges and Strawberries</h2>
								<p>Five hours to myself this morning... </p>
<p>I went in to see the new mom yesterday for forty-five minutes. The little guy had to have the needle in his heel, and then enough blood squeezed out to cover five or six circles on a card for testing.  :( I asked the nurse if he could just stay lying next to his mom, sleeping before she started, instead of moving him to the bassinette. She was kind enough to consider this, and it worked. He cried so hard, but at least he could smell his mom and she could stroke him as it continued. Boo hoo. So hard to see this. Somehow he got a stomach infection, so was on an IV for it; his little arm was taped to a tiny "board", but at least he was not in the nursery but with his mom in the room. I met the father and his mother-in-law, visiting for a month from Italy, as I was going in. They were going to the cafeteria for a late lunch, so I had the time with Patrizia and the baby. I took her in a newborn onesie.. the little undershirts with the snaps under the crotch, a nice big pear from Costco, a few baby mandarins called "cuties", and a few squares of good chocolate. Patrizia said she feels as though Cara and I are now part of her family, that we shared such an important time with them, and she wants to have us over to their home, and to always keep in touch. This is unusual, but there are a few special people that I feel the same about... and am in touch with, if not as often as I would like to be. </p>
<p>I have a baby album done and ready to deliver to one couple in the Mission District tonight. They speak no English at all... well, the dad speaks a tiny bit, so it won't be possible to maintain a relationship with them. I would only be able to go over and coo at the baby.  :) </p>
<p>Bryn phoned me at 11 yesterday and asked if I would like to go out for lunch with him. Good thing I just had fruit and nuts for breakfast as we went to a newly opened pizza place close by... individual thin crust pizzas with lots of different toppings. I ordered the nettle and ricotta cheese pizza and it was so good. I had just half of this small pizza so I know what I'm having for lunch today! It was lovely, although I was so filled with the birthing story, that he barely had time to tell me all the latest cutest things the children were doing. :) </p>
<p>I had Miss Mirei with me after the visit to the hospital. Akane had her in the stroller for the walk up to pick up Riku, and she fell asleep as soon as they started out, at 2:30. I managed to get the stroller up all these stairs to our level, she stayed sleeping throughout it all, and slept until 5 p.m.! .. two and a half hours in the stroller! I couldn't believe it! Bryn was here less than a half hour later, after we had read about six Caillou stories, which she just recently discovered and loves. </p>
<p>He took her home for dinner while I finished up a batch of mini-brownies in a tiny cupcake pan to drop off for the nurses on my way over to their place at 6. The nurses are so appreciative of any food at all, and especially homebaked chocolate goodies or cookies. I had also baked a batch of gingerbread cookies as they were all out at Hampshire Street, and I was out here too. I must mix up another batch to have on hand in the fridge ready to go for the next lot. </p>
<p>I tucked Riku into bed at 7:10 but didn't have time before Akane and Bryn left to have him fall asleep with me. Not good, as Mirei was being pretty loud, he knew I was there and he just had trouble dropping off on his own as he does with his dad and mom. He finally fell asleep at 8:15 when I put Mirei in her crib with some books and toys and cuddled him. She was just starting to complain when he drifted off... and then she was awake at 10:3o when her parents walked in the door! Egad! But of course she had only wakened five hours earlier so it made sense that she had trouble falling asleep for me. </p>
<p>Tired me went up to bed before 11, leaving my kitchen in a bit of a mess, but more than ready for my bed. It's clean now.  :) </p>
