								<h2>Happy New Year!</h2>
								<p>Well, here I am at the end of the first day of the New Year! It was a quiet day here, but a productive one too. After a healthy and not quite as indulgent a breakfast as usual... one of my resolutions is to lose ten pounds... I did the usual Monday wash, despite it feeling like a holiday and then, just to be extra good, decided to get the ironing out of the way. Leonard Cohen was being interviewed by Terry Gross on NPR, so it made the forty-five minutes pass by very pleasantly. </p>
<p>Then it was on to preparing cards to go out in the mail, answering a few emails, and puttering about enjoying the lit Christmas tree on this foggy day. I decided not to take it down today, as has been our tradition, as I just haven't had enough of it yet. It looks just lovely on these dull days.</p>
<p>I spoke with Glenn and Uncle Frank today; Glenn had a busy house last night with Sheldon, Donna, Ian, Lisa, and a few others over last night, to bring in the New Year with them. He said they ended up with too much food, as everyone brought lots with them, but it was all good... lots of seafood and steaks. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank had the day "off" with no physio, and sounded much perkier and more himself than he has sounded in over a week. Virginia answered the phone in his room, and she and Joe stayed for dinner with him tonight; it was good to know that he had company on this first night of the year. </p>
<p>I had a long chat with Amelia too, who was happy to fill me in on lots of details in her life lately... her dad threw their Christmas tree out the window because the needles were falling off, she saw bats in the park a few nights ago(!), she likes her doll house from Uncle Bryn and Akane a lot, she has so many monkeys and a Curious George one too(!), and thought it was a good idea for me to come over one night to babysit her and play with her new toys. Whew! What fun to have these long conversations with the children now. Amelia has had a bad cough for the longest time, although it bothers her mostly while she is lying down trying to sleep. She will be back in school tomorrow morning. </p>
<p>Bryn called during the afternoon to let me know that there seems to be no filling up Miss Mirei these days. He told me all she had eaten up to that point today... rice, nori, bottles of baby fruit and veggies, gingerbread cookies, oatmeal with flax seed and blueberries, and still wasn't ready to settle down for her nap until he had topped her up once more! I guess she has big plans for 2007... walking is in her future, and no doubt running, and climbing and eating more and more interesting foods. Akane and Riku were out for a couple of hours together and then planned an early New Year's Day celebration dinner at home with Bryn and Mirei. </p>
<p>Riku goes back to school tomorrow as well; I wish both children had another week off school. We didn't even get to the zoo, as planned, or down to the valley to visit with Ellen either. Time flies by much too quickly for my liking. </p>
<p>The Toronto crew called this afternoon to thank us for their just-opened last Christmas gift from us... a stay at Wolf Creek Lodge in Niagara Falls, a huge indoor water park. Kelly said it was a great gift as they have all been wanting to go there, having heard raves about it from friends, so that was a hit. </p>
<p>Also a huge hit from Kelly for the children were individual photo albums of their trip to the Grand Canyon a year ago October. Kelly said the house went from being wild with excitement about our gift, to a very quiet contemplation of their own individual albums. I spoke with each of the children and then Kelly and I managed to have a long conversation as well about their New Year's Eve celebration with neighbours and their visit to the Manitoulin with Gregg's parents, Myk', and Bryant. </p>
<p>Doug and I had a quiet evening at home, with dinner upstairs while watching a taped movie. We had done some culling of online photos earlier in the day, and spent another hour doing so again after the show. We are now up to the end of my trip to Ontario in September, so are getting closer and closer to being caught up. It will be such a relief to be back to staying current. </p>
<p>Off to bed at 11:50... hours earlier than the past three nights! </p>
