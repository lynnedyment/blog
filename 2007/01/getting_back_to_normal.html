								<h2>Getting Back to Normal!</h2>
								<p>Which means it's time for the tree to come down, the decorations to be put away for another year, and the rooms to get back to the way they looked in early December. Tomorrow is the last day for the tree to be picked up, and as much as I hated to see those bright lights in the living room go out, I also knew I had been given a nudge to get on with it. </p>
<p>It was also time to celebrate Akane's birthday properly, complete with cake and presents. Today seemed the perfect day to do so, which meant baking a cake. I decided on Judy Rodgers cake from the Zuni Caf√©... my favourite dessert at one of my favourite San Francisco restaurants, and so got busy at that before eating my breakfast. Not having read the recipe correctly, and not realizing that I needed heavy cream for the baking, and not just for garnish, I walked up the steep set of stairs the next block over, just to find the corner grocery store was not open on Sundays! Back to get the car, and over to 20th Street, and then back to the cake. Soon it was baking in a hot water bath, and Mirei was on her way over for her nap. </p>
<p>I had just enough time to scramble an egg and make some toast before Bryn walked in with both children. Riku had decided he was coming over too, while Akane showered, getting ready for their noodles lunch in Chinatown. Surprisingly, Riku asked to sit at the table and use the clay, so he did that while I fed Mirei... it goes without saying that she can always eat more. She sat at the table too, and the blue jay came for a visit. Perfect timing, and Mirei watched as two eager birds flew in, a ringside view of them eating peanuts. </p>
<p>After Bryn and Riku left, Mirei slept for an hour and a quarter. She woke happy though and was ready to explore on her own, pulling out lots of toys from the basket and letting Grandpa carry her around. She does like to get his attention, and no matter how busy he is, somehow she manages quite nicely to get her way! I fed her avocado, rice cereal with fruit, and the last of her hard tack... baby "cookies", which she quite enjoys, sitting very patiently at the table gumming away at them. She uses her four little teeth very well. </p>
<p>Bryn called from a very busy and noisy playground in Chinatown to say that Riku was happily playing and burning off his lunch. I started taking the icicles off the tree, while Mirei kept busy nearby. When Akane, Bryn, and Riku came in, Akane helped me take the rest of the decorations off the tree, which made for a much faster job. </p>
<p>The cake was ready, the cream whipped for the top, so around 4 o'clock we lit the candles and watched the children's faces as we sang Happy Birthday twice, just to see them again! We gave Akane gift certificates for three local restaurants, complete with babysitting of course, and Bryn gave her a huge set of Beatles music... scores, I believe, of all of their work. Susan and Kevin gave her a subscription to a German magazine. </p>
<p>Riku was fading fast and asked if he could sleep here, but Doug has a 6 A.M. flight which made that impossible.  I suggested leaving Mirei here for what we hoped would be a second short nap, but she had other ideas, and would not give in at all. Bryn came over to fetch her, which was very handy, as it was just in time to help Doug take the last of the lights off, and get the tree downstairs without scattering dry needles all through the hallway and down the stairs. </p>
<p>Doug packed, I cleaned a very messy kitchen, and didn't get some of the things done I had hoped to today, such as finishing the clearing of photos up to the end of 2006, and maybe even getting one large album ready to annotate. However, we were both tired, so headed up to bed early. The alarm will be set for 4 A.M. and I wanted to read a bit and still have the light out by 10:30. I'll be up at 4:30... </p>
