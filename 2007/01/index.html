								<h2><a href="/2007/01/happy_new_year_1.html">Happy New Year!</a></h2>
								<p>Well, here I am at the end of the first day of the New Year! It was a quiet day here, but a productive one too. After a healthy and not quite as indulgent a breakfast as usual... one of my resolutions is to lose ten pounds... I did the usual Monday wash, despite it feeling like a holiday and then, just to be extra good, decided to get the ironing out of the way. Leonard Cohen was being interviewed by Terry Gross on NPR, so it made the forty-five minutes pass by very pleasantly. </p>
<p>Then it was on to preparing cards to go out in the mail, answering a few emails, and puttering about enjoying the lit Christmas tree on this foggy day. I decided not to take it down today, as has been our tradition, as I just haven't had enough of it yet. It looks just lovely on these dull days.</p>
<p>I spoke with Glenn and Uncle Frank today; Glenn had a busy house last night with Sheldon, Donna, Ian, Lisa, and a few others over last night, to bring in the New Year with them. He said they ended up with too much food, as everyone brought lots with them, but it was all good... lots of seafood and steaks. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank had the day "off" with no physio, and sounded much perkier and more himself than he has sounded in over a week. Virginia answered the phone in his room, and she and Joe stayed for dinner with him tonight; it was good to know that he had company on this first night of the year. </p>
<p>I had a long chat with Amelia too, who was happy to fill me in on lots of details in her life lately... her dad threw their Christmas tree out the window because the needles were falling off, she saw bats in the park a few nights ago(!), she likes her doll house from Uncle Bryn and Akane a lot, she has so many monkeys and a Curious George one too(!), and thought it was a good idea for me to come over one night to babysit her and play with her new toys. Whew! What fun to have these long conversations with the children now. Amelia has had a bad cough for the longest time, although it bothers her mostly while she is lying down trying to sleep. She will be back in school tomorrow morning. </p>
<p>Bryn called during the afternoon to let me know that there seems to be no filling up Miss Mirei these days. He told me all she had eaten up to that point today... rice, nori, bottles of baby fruit and veggies, gingerbread cookies, oatmeal with flax seed and blueberries, and still wasn't ready to settle down for her nap until he had topped her up once more! I guess she has big plans for 2007... walking is in her future, and no doubt running, and climbing and eating more and more interesting foods. Akane and Riku were out for a couple of hours together and then planned an early New Year's Day celebration dinner at home with Bryn and Mirei. </p>
<p>Riku goes back to school tomorrow as well; I wish both children had another week off school. We didn't even get to the zoo, as planned, or down to the valley to visit with Ellen either. Time flies by much too quickly for my liking. </p>
<p>The Toronto crew called this afternoon to thank us for their just-opened last Christmas gift from us... a stay at Wolf Creek Lodge in Niagara Falls, a huge indoor water park. Kelly said it was a great gift as they have all been wanting to go there, having heard raves about it from friends, so that was a hit. </p>
<p>Also a huge hit from Kelly for the children were individual photo albums of their trip to the Grand Canyon a year ago October. Kelly said the house went from being wild with excitement about our gift, to a very quiet contemplation of their own individual albums. I spoke with each of the children and then Kelly and I managed to have a long conversation as well about their New Year's Eve celebration with neighbours and their visit to the Manitoulin with Gregg's parents, Myk', and Bryant. </p>
<p>Doug and I had a quiet evening at home, with dinner upstairs while watching a taped movie. We had done some culling of online photos earlier in the day, and spent another hour doing so again after the show. We are now up to the end of my trip to Ontario in September, so are getting closer and closer to being caught up. It will be such a relief to be back to staying current. </p>
<p>Off to bed at 11:50... hours earlier than the past three nights! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/01/happy_birthday_akane.html">Happy Birthday, Akane!</a></h2>
								<p>Today is Akane's 39th birthday. We have always been in Ontario for this celebration, while Akane has been in Japan for New Year's day... and her birthday. Dinner out at an authentic Chinese restaurant had been planned, so rather than eat from a fairly small choice of non-meat dishes, I had volunteered to babysit while Akane and Bryn ate out. I couldn't face the thought of someone at the next table ordering a dish served complete with chicken or duck head, even I were eating noodles! </p>
<p>Riku stopped in for a quick hello and a gingerbread cookie on his way to school this morning. He was wearing a Canadian/Maple Leaf hat, a matching jacket, and a Canadian Hockey pullover too! He was excited about seeing his best friend Nicolo at school today. </p>
<p>I had a quiet but busy morning at home, but called Akane to suggest that she and I have lunch out. She was up for it, and an hour later arrived with Mirei, all ready for her nap. I tucked her in... it took longer than usual, but it sure was entertaining. I lie beside her, but out of sight, on the double bed in Riku's room. Usually she chats a little bit, but since she is always ready for her nap, it doesn't take long until she is rubbing her eyes, pulling at her ears, and sighing big sighs. Today however, she was a busy little gal with so much chatting going on! And I could see her little index finger pointing to the print on the wall, and chatting to it, and then at the lighthouse, and the wall hanging which Auntie Sandy had given Kelly when she was a baby. A butterfly is painted on it, and it was such fun to watch her make our sign for butterflies, opening and closing her fists as they flutter above her head. I am sure it took her fifteen minutes to settle, but settle she did, and slept nicely for two solid hours for her Grandpa. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Akane and I were sitting having a very nice lunch at Cafe Gratitude, a choice both Akane and I were happy with. She has been there once before and this was my third visit; Akane had the enchilada special, and I had the "sun burger". All the food here is made "raw", all vegan and with bases of delicious nuts and seeds for the most part. Akane was very happy with her meal, but I didn't like mine nearly as much as the warm grain bowls I had on the previous two visits. The dressing on the "burger" with its strong tomato "ketchup" flavour did not sit well with the strong but very different dressing on the salad. However, we had shared an appetizer which was delicious, a combo of four different toppings on seeded unbaked "bread", and the "burger" was OK, just not something I would order again. Our server suggested I try it without the tomato topping the next time, but there are so many other good things on the menu that I will try first. </p>
<p>We left at 2:35 to pick Riku up from school. He was a very tired boy today, his first day back after a two week holiday. He came close to falling asleep in the car, but we managed to keep him awake until we reached our local playground a few minutes later. He suggested we call his dad so he could be the "monster", chasing him around, but instead I got this role, and chased after him, and his mom too... although really it was Riku I was growling after. How Riku loves this! He climbs fast up all the slides, and begs me not to catch him when he starts getting tired. However, the minute he catches his breath, off he goes again. Doug called just twenty minutes after we got there, but by then Riku was ready to come back here, and Akane and I were ready for tea. Oh, Riku told me that Nicolo has Power Rangers! Big news in his four-year-old life. </p>
<p>That Mirei! What a character she is! She was very happy to see her mommy, and nursed right away, but losing interest once the shortbread cookies were put on the table! That little finger was busy once again, pointing to make it clear that she wanted a cookie for herself. Even if you hide something from her, behind a cup for instance, she will lean way over and point, letting you know that you aren't fooling her one bit! Then it was playtime for her, following Riku around, flirting with her Grandpa, and exploring my basket of paper in the kitchen, until she came back to the table for some food. </p>
<p>How she eats! First came an entire jar of spring vegetables, then half of a very ripe pear, followed by some avocado bites, and a teething biscuit. Riku was hungry as well, and too tired to join Akane, Bryn, Brent, and his new girlfriend for dinner, so they went off while I fed Riku: two scrambled eggs, two pieces of "bacon", almost a full piece of toast, and a side dish of tomatoes. Doug dropped us off at Bryn's place, and for dessert Riku ate an entire orange on his own. Meanwhile, Mirei was once again eating there... another container of vegetables, a bowl of rice cereal, and half a jar of mixed fruit. </p>
<p>Bedtime routine followed almost immediately after dinner... Mirei was obviously tired, so while Riku played on his own in his room, I tried to settle her, but even though she showed signs of being very tired, she didn't settle, so up she got. I got Riku into his pajamas, he brushed his teeth, tried so hard to do some cleaning up after his sister messed up some toys in his room. This is his biggest complaint of all: Riku likes his room clean and isn't happy when things are spread about and out of place. He gives Mirei something to play with, but keeps a very close eye on her, as some things he just does not want her chewing on... his new Ultraman, for instance, or his three-headed monster! At one point, when he was anxious about what she was going to ruin, he said to me, "Nana, I am being serious with you. I don't want her to mess up my room." </p>
<p>I read "Green Eggs and Ham" to Riku, with Mirei sitting on my lap looking at the pictures. Riku really liked the book; it has been a while since I've read it to him, and it was long enough that by the end of it he was happy to lie down and settle in. I kissed him goodnight, and Mirei and I left the room at 7:15. I didn't hear a word from his room, but wished I had a monitor in there so I could hear if he chats to himself. </p>
<p>I was feeding Mirei more vegetables when Akane and Bryn walked in at 7:25. Oh, what a happy girl she was to see her mommy, and making it clear she wanted no one else, she settled right in to nurse. Bryn was trying to tuck her in when I left but by the time I got home, he had IM'd me saying she was "at the table, taking a bite of food, flirting, taking another bite, flirting... " My, my, she may put on a few pounds this month! </p>
<p>Doug picked me up after his T'ai Chi class, and home we came to watch a Helen Mirren DVD. I drifted off during some of it, but enjoyed most of the hour and a half first part of it... to be continued tomorrow perhaps. I tidied my very messy kitchen, folded a dryer full of clothes, and finished off the evening by going through half of the October photos on file in the computer. How Mirei has changed in these past two months. Her hemangioma has really lightened up, and is not such an angry and dark red anymore. She has slimmed out too, although it looks as though she's trying to fix that up! </p>
<p>Bed before midnight... oh, and cake and presents for Akane were put off until an evening with more free time for the children to join in. Akane is quite happy to have an extended birthday event! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/01/visitors.html">Visitors!</a></h2>
								<p>I had a very quiet, productive time at home this morning, puttering about and getting lots done. Then the door bell rang and it was Susan and Amelia. Susan was dropping off some things for storage, and delivering a borrowed tin, filled with Christmas cookie and candy treats, and also a large yummy looking pannetone. Lucky us!</p>
<p>The cat from across the street had meandered over just as Susan and Amelia were leaving their car, so I went downstairs with Amelia so she could check him/her out. Amelia loves animals, and this cat wound itself around her legs, and much to her delight, rolled over and over on its tummy, leaving its belly open to be rubbed. Amelia obliged. The cat followed us when we walked down the street a bit, and then followed us back to our driveway. It was a delightful time as there was no rush to do anything but appreciate the cat and its antics. </p>
<p>During that time together, I asked Amelia if she would like to stay and have grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch, so when Susan told her it was time to leave she informed her what we were doing instead. What a lovely little break; normally Amelia would have been at preschool but she wasn't feeling well this morning and so we had a couple of hours together, with her mommy too. Susan is soooo big! That baby boy is moving a lot; Susan says she thinks he is building the Taj Mahal!, and with only 13 days to his due date, he is showing no signs of slowing down a bit. We sat at the table chatting, eating our grilled cheese, and noshing on Christmas cookies with our tea/apple juice. </p>
<p>While waiting for lunch, Amelia sat down at the little desk and drew a picture for us; she made lots of little dots with dark and light blue marker, and then drew an oval shaped figure to the right of them, complete with two eyes and a mouth. Susan volunteered that it looked like a potato, but Amelia was quick to tell us that it was an egg. I had asked if the dots were rain or snow and so the title of the painting, signed with a big A, is "egg in a snowstorm". Of course it is hanging on the window of the kitchen area, so we all can see it every day. </p>
<p>Amelia went home for a two and a half hour nap(!) ... and so did her mommy ... and I awaited Mirei's arrival, later than usual today as Riku is being taken to his piano lesson by one of the other moms in the group. When Mirei did show up she was obviously more than ready for her nap; we got smiles but there was no hesitation at all when I took her in for her bed. She put both feet up in the air to pull off her socks, making me smile as always, and we had a tiny bit of peek-a-boo with her feet, but within five short minutes I was walking out the door with a little girl all tucked in and sound asleep. </p>
<p>I got to work on the front bedroom, which was used at Christmas Central over the past few weeks. I had a little cleaning to do before Celeste arrived, and the bedding to change once Mirei woke up at 5... a nice hour and a half hour sleep. Of course the first thing I do when she wakens is feed her, and she was sitting enjoying avocado bites when her daddy walked in. He gets big big smiles from her every time, and sat with us while she licked a bit of avocado off her finger, and pointed out various objects to him, that she knows from her walkabouts with Grandpa. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep in the car, with Akane reading, while Bryn picked up mail, their cookie platter from Susan, and Miss Mirei. I did a quick vacuuming on this floor, Doug and I had dinner, and Celeste arrived at 8:10... perfect timing as everything I had to do was done. </p>
<p>I had ordered two devices from Celeste after an email from her came in a few weeks ago describing them. One is good for lower back/hip aches, and the other is for the head... to aid in relaxation and something to do with the cranial sacral points... Celeste's area of expertise. Candy had ordered them too, and was confused as to how to use the one for the head, so off we went for a demonstration. Flat on the carpeted floor, I lay with the hardish bumpy device under the tender indentation in the back of my skull. It was fine, and felt good, so I am to use it as often during the day as I feel the need to. It helps with headaches, tiredness, and for lots of other situations too. From the floor I went up on the bed, while Celeste placed a "wedgie" under my head in the right spot. She made sure it was in the right place, covered my eyes with a soft blanket and left me to relax for as long as it felt comfortable. A half hour later, after having entered what Celeste calls an alpha state, I emerged feeling <strong>very</strong> relaxed and ready for bed! I wasn't really sleeping but felt the way I used to during relaxation classes in West Vancouver. What a feeling... just so relaxed. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped in at 10 P.M. after his ping pong lesson, and demonstrated how he was learning to use his torso to play, standing on his toes and leaning forward, and not swinging with his arms... all the things he has been doing wrong since he and Brent started playing a couple of years ago. </p>
<p>And then we got down to the real business of the day... exchanging stories about what Mirei had done today or last night, and what Riku has been coming out with. I could go on for ages, but one of the highlights of the past twenty-four hours was Bryn watching Mirei in their darkened bedroom, putting herself to sleep. First she got up on all fours and threw out one doll. Then she stood up and tossed another, but missed, so she bent down, grappling in the dark for it, until she found it, and then over it went! She muttered a bit, changed positions a few times, but put her head down and off she went to slumberland. Bryn said she had stood up twice before that and he put her down, but finally decided to leave her to sort it out, and she did! </p>
<p>Garry had Skyped from Montreal today, and I got to tell him the story of being in the car with Riku, who was quite quiet on the way home from school the other day. I asked him what he was thinking of and he said "clouds". He was quite pensive and I asked him what he was thinking about the clouds. His answer: "They are drinking beer."! Akane and I burst out laughing, and of course so did he. That boy likes nothing more than making people laugh out loud at something he has said. </p>
<p>Bryn has some other great stories too, but is going to write them in his blog.. Mirei standing on her own in the bathroom, and Riku's excitement about it, Riku reminding his dad to "stay focused", and Mirei straining to get a look at what Riku had on his plate for dinner, hoping to scarf some of his toast!  You can always ask me about them at some point, if you don't read them somewhere else! </p>
<p>While Celeste unpacked and settled in, I sat and read for a few minutes in the living room, read a few emails, but really wanted to do nothing more than go to bed. I managed to read longer than usual, but the light was out at 11:30. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/01/where_did_the_day_go.html">Where Did the Day Go?</a></h2>
								<p>At this rate, it will be Christmas in just weeks! I cannot believe how quickly the days pass by; it seems I go from morning breakfast to almost bedtime in far too few hours. I knew the days pass more quickly as we age but this feels like hyper-speed to me. </p>
<p>Mirei and Akane here at 12:15 with the idea being that I would put Mirei down for her nap at 12:30, leave the house at 12:45 for my doula meeting, with Akane leaving at the same time for home, and then meeting Riku at 3 P.M. as always. Doug would be here for Mirei waking around 2:30-3, with me arriving home around that time as well. Ah, how differently all this worked out. Despite two attempts to put Mirei down, she was having none of it. Foolishly, I didn't see if she was the least bit hungry when she first arrived, and it was the first thing I thought of when she wouldn't settle within minutes. I got her up, and she happily ate a very generous bowl of rice cereal. It seemed it should be enough as she had nursed before she arrived, and had eaten at home too, but still she was just not going to settle down. Up she got again, and I fed her avocado, and oatmeal with berries. Finally I had to leave, later than I should have, with the plan now that Akane would settle her down, and Doug would pick Riku up from school. </p>
<p>Off I went, arriving fifteen minutes late, but had a wonderful lunch with our doula coordinator, a maternity nurse of 27 years standing at the SF General. She's warm, low-key, and very much in favour of doulas for every labouring moms who wants one. Two other doulas were there as well, and we chatted about hospital protocol and shifts for us, and learned how to deal with moms who are on illegal drugs or have mental problems, both of which may occur at the General. </p>
<p>We ate at  what is my current favourite neighbourhood restaurant, where I ate with Akane on her birthday. Not having much time to peruse the menu, I settled on a dish I enjoy so much... a "warm bowl" of quinoa, pesto, and tomatoes. I am looking forward to using my Christmas gift certificate from Akane and Bryn over the next few months... or weeks perhaps. </p>
<p>At 2:20 we met at the hospital and had a tour of the maternity ward. I have been there before but had forgotten some of the details... the locked codes for various rooms and how to work the controls on the beds... amazing beds! There were four births taking place and Monnie told us what was going on with each birth... the stage, the circumstances, and what the many acronyms stood for. </p>
<p>As I was pulling into the garage at 3:10, it hit me that Doug could not have picked up Riku since I had the car! Egad! I dashed upstairs to learn that Mirei had <strong>not</strong> napped!... not for five minutes the entire day, and that Bryn had been called at work to pick Riku up... just fifteen minutes late, thank goodness. </p>
<p>So, there I was at 3:30, once more feeding Mirei... and she finally napped for an hour and a half.</p>
<p>While she napped, Akane, Riku, Doug, and I opened the Christmas gifts that arrived from Toronto yesterday. Kelly bought five books for the children, all just perfect for Riku, and for Mirei to grow into. Riku sat while I read each one to him, and then asked for "What Happens if You Give a Mouse a Cookie" twice. "Ferdinand the Bull" was a favourite too, and they all went home with them. They have a very full bookcase, but Riku so enjoys his books. While I was reading to him tonight, he wrapped his arm around my neck and said solemnly, "I really like you Nana". </p>
<p> We also had birthday and Christmas gifts for Mirei that hadn't been opened, so Akane opened all of those while Doug and I opened our Canadian books, all carefully chosen by Kelly. Bryn and Caillie made us a beautifully coloured bowl, one of my very favourite gifts from the children. I have such a lovely collection already, and one day perhaps I won't need any more bowls, mugs, or small platters than the ones our grandchildren made for us. Mirei did not long sleep long enough, just an hour and a half, but in time for her daddy walking in the door right then to take them all home at 5:30. Instead however, Mirei, the starving girl, insisted on nursing immediately, and Riku was hungry so he ate dinner here, working on some buildings with his dad, using the magnetic blocks. We all said goodnight to each other at 6:45. Mirei can now spot me at the window and looks up to see me in the light.</p>
<p>Oh, yesterday we were watching the leaves blow from the bedroom window, and I made a whirling motion with my hand for the action. It was windy again today, and I turned Mirei's chair in the kitchen so she could see the leaves while she ate; she immediately put both hands up in the air, waving them about with quite a different motion that she uses for the more gentle butterfly demo. And this afternoon she obviously remembered that we had been putting our hands up in the air, for "up!" and then lowering them for "down", and proceeded to have her mommy and me follow her this time... over and over again. She's quick, this girl! </p>
<p>I relaxed with the sacral therapy tools Celeste brought for me, both of which completely relax me in a very short time. Perhaps it helps that I am just lying quietly in the dark with not a sound to be heard, but most likely it is the combination of both of these that does the trick. </p>
<p>Doug was at T'ai Chi this evening, came home and had a quick dinner, and got right back to work at a project for work with a deadline. </p>
<p>After Celeste arrived home, she had Doug use the knobby device on his head, lying flat out on the floor. He totally relaxed but in his case having his temples stroked and then his earlobes rubbed absolutely caused him to breathe deeply and "sink" into the pressure exerted by this strange looking device. </p>
<p>I watched a couple of Oprah tapes and headed for bed early tonight... before 11 P.M.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/01/getting_back_to_normal.html">Getting Back to Normal!</a></h2>
								<p>Which means it's time for the tree to come down, the decorations to be put away for another year, and the rooms to get back to the way they looked in early December. Tomorrow is the last day for the tree to be picked up, and as much as I hated to see those bright lights in the living room go out, I also knew I had been given a nudge to get on with it. </p>
<p>It was also time to celebrate Akane's birthday properly, complete with cake and presents. Today seemed the perfect day to do so, which meant baking a cake. I decided on Judy Rodgers cake from the Zuni Café... my favourite dessert at one of my favourite San Francisco restaurants, and so got busy at that before eating my breakfast. Not having read the recipe correctly, and not realizing that I needed heavy cream for the baking, and not just for garnish, I walked up the steep set of stairs the next block over, just to find the corner grocery store was not open on Sundays! Back to get the car, and over to 20th Street, and then back to the cake. Soon it was baking in a hot water bath, and Mirei was on her way over for her nap. </p>
<p>I had just enough time to scramble an egg and make some toast before Bryn walked in with both children. Riku had decided he was coming over too, while Akane showered, getting ready for their noodles lunch in Chinatown. Surprisingly, Riku asked to sit at the table and use the clay, so he did that while I fed Mirei... it goes without saying that she can always eat more. She sat at the table too, and the blue jay came for a visit. Perfect timing, and Mirei watched as two eager birds flew in, a ringside view of them eating peanuts. </p>
<p>After Bryn and Riku left, Mirei slept for an hour and a quarter. She woke happy though and was ready to explore on her own, pulling out lots of toys from the basket and letting Grandpa carry her around. She does like to get his attention, and no matter how busy he is, somehow she manages quite nicely to get her way! I fed her avocado, rice cereal with fruit, and the last of her hard tack... baby "cookies", which she quite enjoys, sitting very patiently at the table gumming away at them. She uses her four little teeth very well. </p>
<p>Bryn called from a very busy and noisy playground in Chinatown to say that Riku was happily playing and burning off his lunch. I started taking the icicles off the tree, while Mirei kept busy nearby. When Akane, Bryn, and Riku came in, Akane helped me take the rest of the decorations off the tree, which made for a much faster job. </p>
<p>The cake was ready, the cream whipped for the top, so around 4 o'clock we lit the candles and watched the children's faces as we sang Happy Birthday twice, just to see them again! We gave Akane gift certificates for three local restaurants, complete with babysitting of course, and Bryn gave her a huge set of Beatles music... scores, I believe, of all of their work. Susan and Kevin gave her a subscription to a German magazine. </p>
<p>Riku was fading fast and asked if he could sleep here, but Doug has a 6 A.M. flight which made that impossible.  I suggested leaving Mirei here for what we hoped would be a second short nap, but she had other ideas, and would not give in at all. Bryn came over to fetch her, which was very handy, as it was just in time to help Doug take the last of the lights off, and get the tree downstairs without scattering dry needles all through the hallway and down the stairs. </p>
<p>Doug packed, I cleaned a very messy kitchen, and didn't get some of the things done I had hoped to today, such as finishing the clearing of photos up to the end of 2006, and maybe even getting one large album ready to annotate. However, we were both tired, so headed up to bed early. The alarm will be set for 4 A.M. and I wanted to read a bit and still have the light out by 10:30. I'll be up at 4:30... </p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/01/clap_and_wiggle.html">Clap and Wiggle and Two New Teeth!</a></h2>
								<p>Very early wakening today; Doug woke me at 4:40 as planned for the ten minute drive to the airport. He is off to Waukesha, Kansas until Thursday morning but phoned later to let me know he was delayed in Denver for four hours! I was back home and in bed again at 6 A.M. after writing a couple of emails and heating up two bed buddies. They were the secret to getting back to sleep, along with trying to read a little in a new book. </p>
<p>I spent some time this morning taking photographs of most of our Christmas tree decorations and some of our holiday decorations as well.... things that my children made when they were much younger... Bryn's snowman from kindergarten and "dough" figures we made years later. I would like to make our own Christmas cards next year, or at least some of them, but also thought it would be fun to have an album documenting each one. Gram should always be remembered as the person who gave us the pink popcorn momentos! </p>
<p>Akane rang the doorbell just after 2 o'clock with a sleeping girl in her arms. She hadn't napped all morning, and of course minutes after being put in the stroller she was sound asleep. That was enough to keep her from falling asleep again for me, tired as she was, rubbing her eyes, and looking a little dazed. I prepared her some food, in case that might help, and as always Mirei just polished it all off... a <strong>big</strong> bowl of oatmeal with blueberries, plus a big helping of avocado... perhaps a third of a large one, and finished off with a shortbread cookie and some water. </p>
<p>Today, while sitting there, Mirei and I played the usual games. I asked her where various things were and she would point them out... the brooms, the bird, balloons, which used to hang in the dining room but had been moved to the kitchen last night. Then I raised my hands over my head, as we have been doing for maybe two weeks now, saying "up" as I did so. However, today I also said "wiggle those fingers" and she watched as I did so. The second time her arms went up in the air, she wiggled her fingers too! I am amazed once again by how closely she pays attention and then copies me. She too clapped for herself when I did for her! </p>
<p>Doug is always astounded by how quickly she remembers the things that he points out on their "walkabouts" from room to room. He says he can't forget a thing, or she leans back to point it out to him. If he asks her where "the big man" is, she points immediately to the almost ceiling-high Mountie in the dining room. But, if he doesn't talk about the Mountie's hat, she will put her hand on her own head, and pat it, until he responds and says "yes, hat!" The newest thing he taught her was the mistletoe hanging in the kitchen doorway. She has never forgotten where it is, and points it out each and every time they are in the hallway, even if they are pointing the other way and heading away from it. </p>
<p>One more exciting event today... Mirei has a new tooth! She has had quite swollen gums two teeth away from the bottom centre ones, on both sides, for quite some time. Today, as I was went in to check if the one on her left had broken through, I felt above, and found the edge of a new tooth up there! And when I took her home and told Akane she thought it was the one to the right of her bottom centre tooth, as she cut that one two or three days ago. So, six teeth! It has taken so long for her teeth to come in; even though we know all children cut their teeth at different times, Riku had twelve teeth by this age. Mirei doesn't let that stop her from eating everything in sight though; what an appetite this girl has. </p>
<p>I let her meander around the house for a while, hoping to wear her out a little bit. It is such fun to just watch her putter about, perfectly content entertaining herself with all the things she knows she can touch... and can't.  I was very surprised today when she stopped in front of my computer, obviously thinking about pushing the ever- beckoning flashing green button. I looked at her, and in an "I mean it" voice told her "no"... and watched her move on past without a back glance at it. Wow! </p>
<p>I was putting the usual items on the mantle in the living room, getting the ornaments put away, and Mirei was such a happy little girl, looking at her tiny book on the coffee table, checking out the metal birds that always sat on the hearth, and visiting the folk art chickens that had been moved during Christmas. Once I spotted her rubbing those tired eyes, I tried to put her down for her nap, but I think the little nap and the lack of sleep had thrown her off, so we headed out to the playground in the stroller at 4 o'clock. I don't think it took two minutes for those eyes to close. It was coolish, and she was nicely bundled up, looking as sweet as could be. </p>
<p>Akane and Riku were there, with Riku looking more tired than usual, but it's been a long day for him at this stage of his day. Bryn says he is at his lowest ebb at dinner time, but often rouses during that time. He  was playing in the sandbox when I arrived and as soon as he spotted me, he handed me a lovely single yellow flower "for you Nana!" with a big smile. </p>
<p>Akane took over the stroller and headed off for a walk, as the playground is too noisy. Mirei would waken immediately to see what she was missing! Riku played with a little boy in the sandbox and then they chased each other around, while his mom and I chatted. When Riku spotted the mom with a baby, he went right up to her and said "Your baby is very cute. How old is she?" He was told three months, and then turned to me to let me know. Later on he asked her name... Ava, and then introduced himself to Ava's mom, telling her his name and his age too, as well as the fact that he had a sister and her name is Mirei, and she is one year old. What a guy he is... Mr. Sociable! Akane laughed when I told her and said he sounded like me. I suppose he does... not a bad thing.  :) The mom, Merissa, is from Dublin and I quite enjoyed her lovely accent as we talked. </p>
<p>Akane returned with a still sleeping Mirei at 5:10, but shortly after Mirei opened those eyes, still looking very tired. Riku gave her a big hug, and then we headed for home. We all did a little running, and Riku insisted on holding hands with his mom and me both, telling us he loved all of us! He said "I love everyone in the whole city." </p>
<p>Once at home, he tried his best to get me to stay to watch his newest Ultraman DVD; when I told him I had to go home, he suggested I just watch a little bit with him, and then said I could stay and babysit him, and tuck him into bed, and say "Goodnight Riku" and then go home! He sure had lots of great ideas, but all the chores awaiting me at home had me out the door, just in time to meet Bryn coming in. </p>
<p>Home for a "scramble" for dinner... mushrooms, eggs, and tomatoes, with toast, and a hot cup of tea. I watched a taped Oprah show and learned what the "Red" campaign by Bono is all about. I had seen the ads on the buses and bus stops and in magazines but hadn't really heard much about it. Now I know that all the various companies are donating up to 50% of the profits from those items for AIDS medication to families in Africa. It was very touching and emotional, as only 40 cents a day will give the money for two pills to keep it from progressing. </p>
<p>Skyped with Doug and Beth today, heard from Virginia that Uncle Frank's surgeon is very pleased with his progress, and I answered a few emails, just not enough to make any dent in the huge stack that awaits me. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/01/happy_birthday_susan.html">Happy Birthday, Susan!</a></h2>
								<p>Today is Susan's birthday! I awoke to find a message from her letting me know we were indeed booked in for lunch at Zuni Café at 11:30 today. What a treat... lunch out mid-week at one of my very favourite restaurants, and one that Susan enjoys too. She thinks the last time we were there was for my birthday two years ago, and I think I have been there once or twice since then, just not often enough! I always know what I am going to have... the bowl of creamy polenta, with a little of both cheeses... gorgonzola and parmesan, plus a salad, Acme sourdough bread, and Judy Rodgers' signature chocolate cake. However, Susan ordered the puree of root vegetable soup, and I should have had that instead of the salad. It was delicious and how I would have loved to have dunked my bread into that! We had a great waiter and on cue he brought our one slice of cake from the kitchen with a single candle on it. Perfect. I had a small bouquet of red tulips for Susan, but forgot to give her the birthday card! Shall have to do that at our Sunday morning belated birthday party when the children can be there to see her blow out the candles and share in some cake too. Kevin was in charge of dinner at home tonight, so that Amelia could be there to celebrate too. Susan made her own cheesecake last night, and Amelia helped decorate it today. </p>
<p>Amelia phoned to tell me all about it after arriving home from school. What a treat it was to hear her voice on the phone; she started the conversation off by saying "I love you Nana." Sweet words indeed! We had quite a little chat, about school and what she did today, and hung up saying we would see each other soon. </p>
<p>Akane arrived at 3 P.M. with Mirei, who looked perky and happy and not the least bit tired and in need of a nap. Riku has his group piano lesson today after school and so Mirei gets here later than usual on Wednesdays. She had a busy time, standing on her own in the living room to start off, looking adorable in a denim skirt over a pair of Amelia's old tights, and a sweater of Amelia's too. However, the skirt had to come off, as she kept slipping while trying to stand up as it caught under her knees. I did get a photo of her outfit, though, as she looked ever so cute. We had lots of fun together. I pretend to chase her and she scurries off turning to check to see where I am; we both laugh out loud, and then off she goes again.</p>
<p>We played for a while upstairs today, as it was warmer up there. It's chilly today, although bright and sunny. I lay on the bed reading, watching while she busied herself with the phone locater button, and pulling out all the books from her basket in our room. Oh, Mirei climbed all the way upstairs by herself today! She has been practicing for a few weeks now, but would get just two or three stairs up and decide to turn around. Today, however, she just kept going and then turned at the top and clapped along with me. A big accomplishment! </p>
<p>When I thought it was close to her nap time (she had slept at home for a half hour this morning and for another hour later on), I prepared a nice big bowl of oatmeal for her, complete with blueberries, mashed banana, and flax seed. As always, I could not believe how much she ate! I have adult friends who wouldn't have eaten that much for lunch! </p>
<p>For the second day in a row she fought her nap for a few minutes, but only a few. She was a tired girl, and slept from 5:10 until 6:15. This worked out well for everyone, as Bryn picked up Akane and Riku after Riku's class, and they all went out for a noodle dinner. </p>
<p>Doug called through on Skype just as Mirei was finishing up her post-nap meal; this time she ate two small bowls of corn with rice, a half slice of buttered toast, and a small bowl of my leftover polenta, which she really liked as well. She could hear his voice and answered so loudly that he could hear her! I brought her over to the computer so she could see Doug's photo up on the screen, and what a riot this was. She burst into big smiles when he spoke to her, she waggled her fingers at him, kept grinning away at him, and they "talked" back and forth to each other. He would make a noise and she would squeal back at him. Talk about a mutual admiration society! This was something to see! </p>
<p>While Mirei was eating one of her meals today, she noticed the wind blowing the trees very hard; she used her fairly new sign for "trees" by waving her fingers back and forth up high across her forehead. When I pointed out the trees last week to her it was a windy day, so I used that sign for her, and now I guess trees will always be shown as blowing! As long as we both know what she means and can tell others, we're doing just fine. It is quite a different sign than she uses for butterflies... on her slippers and on the wall hanging, as she keeps her hands lower, and waggles her fingers up and down. Clever girl! </p>
<p>Yesterday Mirei just moved right on past my computer when she was told "no, no" as she looked tempted by the flashing green button, but today she decided not only would she go for it again, but is also determined to use the keyboard now too. What a girl! She has grown tall enough that she can pull it out and start typing away before I notice and how she loves it! I really have to be careful to have it all shut down or I will end up losing things that shouldn't be lost! </p>
<p>Bryn tucked Riku into bed and picked Mirei up at 7:15. She had been playing on her own in the children's bedroom, having discovered Riku's cars. She was in there for ten minutes, and I managed to snap a few photos of her; I'm amazed that at this early age Mirei often manages to keep herself happy and occupied. </p>
<p>Today she stood looking at her two books in front of the coffee table for the longest time, before getting down to crawl to me and see what was happening in the kitchen. Riku was very much like this as well, and still is. Anyway, as soon as she heard her daddy announce himself, she called out "Dada, dada, dada!" and met him in the hallway. Mirei gives big hugs now, and it's very sweet to see this little girl and her daddy so happy to see each other. He is so proud of her and thinks she is the perfect little girl. I'm sure he's right. </p>
<p>Akane had sent over a nicely prepared meal for me, all set to heat up, but I had already eaten some "chicken" vegetable and noodle soup I made up yesterday in the midst of the mess of clearing out the freezer. That was the perfect dinner for me after my hearty lunch, and I now have a meal all set to go tomorrow. </p>
<p>Chore today for Akane and me: we both cleaned out and cleared out our fridge shelves. I had done mine fairly recently so it was a quick job for me, but I also got my ironing out of the way for the week. </p>
<p>Bed too late tonight... midnight already!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/01/family_tree_birthday_wishes_an.html">Bug,  Birthday Wishes, and a Broken Heart</a></h2>
								<p>Well, I have the bug again... the family tree bug, that is! For many years Gail, Candy, and I have been interested in exploring our family history. We have lots of collective memories about past generations, and I have vast amounts of paper bits and notebooks in the house, stuffed with it all. In late November I finally signed up for Ancestry.com, an online family history site. </p>
<p>Gail joined several years ago and whenever I am in Nanaimo with her, we spend time in her office, working for hours each day, and whooping with delight when we confirm yet another date/birth/name. Now that I am signed up... whatever took me so long???? ... we have started working together via Skype, filling in the hundreds of spaces with all that we have collected over the years. </p>
<p>Gail has done a huge amount of work on it on her own, and been very successful. I took lots of notes when Mom and Gram were alive. I connected with a Parcels family member several years ago, who not only did research on our grandmother's side of the family, but on our Rodgers side too... even though he is not related, and Gail just recently connected with a Lee relative now living in Australia. He had a huge collection of family information for us, all collected for his wife, who is the Lee (and was born in Liverpool). </p>
<p>Today was my day to sit here and work with Gail. I had no idea I would spend as many hours sitting on this chair that I did, though, and how I wish I could sit here for another few! I'm hooked, as is Gail. We got so much done together last night, and after Gail went off I continued to look for "siblings unknown" for our great-grandfather... and found a long lost sister! Yahoo! What a high that was, and Gail was just as delighted when she heard. We are just delighted to have new information coming in, from whatever source at all. Finally I can do some searching here as well, and come up with gold too. You can see I'm obsessed. Deep breath. Stop. </p>
<p>I had a surprise visit from Bryn and Riku around the noon hour. I do break for children and grandchildren! Riku and I played "cars" in the little bedroom, racing, and playing bad guys with guns in the cars, when I decided it would be fun for him to make a card for a birthday party he was going to. Campbell, the honoree, is an adult, very sweet with children, and Riku likes her a lot. She was very lucky, receiving an original Riku Dyment hand-coloured card with a colourful pic' on the front, his name signed, with a kiss and hug, and birthday stickers inside and out. There was even time for a design on the back of it. Bryn had him write "Campbell" on the front too, so Riku did it all. Here was the reaction for the recipient: "Thanks for the super cute card.  I loved the sparkles that fell out when I opened it!  Riku is such a cutie..."</p>
<p>Once I was without entertainment, back I went to working along with Gail, until 4:15 when Doug and I left for an early pizza outing at Patxi's Chicago Pizza, with Akane, Mirei, Bryn, and Riku. Riku was at the end of the table by me, and he kept busy with pens and paper, making two pictures for Auntie Kelly. This is her third this week! I get to take photos of them; she gets the originals. Hmmm. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mirei had been sitting between her mom and dad, with Grandpa apparently too far away from her. Bryn realized what was going on, so suggested they switch seats. What a happy little camper she was, as she got to entertain him and be entertained by him. We all love her little flirty moves with him; she puts her head down on the table, looking sideways at him, just waiting for him to put his head down beside hers. It is too cute for words. Akane fed her during all this flirtiness, and she was very happy chewing on the pizza crust once our deep dish pizza arrived. Yum! Riku was happily occupied with one of his favourite pastimes... drawing.</p>
<p>The guys finished up first, so Akane, Mirei, and I took our time finishing up. However, Mirei didn't realize this meant Grandpa would be leaving, and she sat looking at him walking out the door, with a big pout and a look of unbelievable unhappiness on her face, before bursting into tears! What a sad sight. It didn't last long but it was enough that Akane and I knew her heart was broken. </p>
<p>We joined them in a travel store next door, and Mirei was her happy self, being walked around in Doug's arms until... it came time to leave. He tried to pass her over to Akane, and she wasn't having any of it, burying her head in Doug's shoulder and hanging on tight! And then she was sad when I waved goodbye. I think she just doesn't like to see people she loves leave, although this was the very first time we saw her cry... and it was all for Grandpa! </p>
<p>And of course I came back to the family search, sorting out name after name, and being amazed at just how far we have come. We have traced one side of the family back to 1595 in Grenoble, France, and have managed to get to 1804 for the U.K. side, with very little initial information to go on. More to come. I just need to learn to get by on 4 hours sleep a night, and to whiz through my housework in an hour a day. </p>
<p>That's it... thanks to Bryn, who gave me the kick-start I needed! Bedtime... 11 P.M.</p>
