								<h2>Visitors!</h2>
								<p>I had a very quiet, productive time at home this morning, puttering about and getting lots done. Then the door bell rang and it was Susan and Amelia. Susan was dropping off some things for storage, and delivering a borrowed tin, filled with Christmas cookie and candy treats, and also a large yummy looking pannetone. Lucky us!</p>
<p>The cat from across the street had meandered over just as Susan and Amelia were leaving their car, so I went downstairs with Amelia so she could check him/her out. Amelia loves animals, and this cat wound itself around her legs, and much to her delight, rolled over and over on its tummy, leaving its belly open to be rubbed. Amelia obliged. The cat followed us when we walked down the street a bit, and then followed us back to our driveway. It was a delightful time as there was no rush to do anything but appreciate the cat and its antics. </p>
<p>During that time together, I asked Amelia if she would like to stay and have grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch, so when Susan told her it was time to leave she informed her what we were doing instead. What a lovely little break; normally Amelia would have been at preschool but she wasn't feeling well this morning and so we had a couple of hours together, with her mommy too. Susan is soooo big! That baby boy is moving a lot; Susan says she thinks he is building the Taj Mahal!, and with only 13 days to his due date, he is showing no signs of slowing down a bit. We sat at the table chatting, eating our grilled cheese, and noshing on Christmas cookies with our tea/apple juice. </p>
<p>While waiting for lunch, Amelia sat down at the little desk and drew a picture for us; she made lots of little dots with dark and light blue marker, and then drew an oval shaped figure to the right of them, complete with two eyes and a mouth. Susan volunteered that it looked like a potato, but Amelia was quick to tell us that it was an egg. I had asked if the dots were rain or snow and so the title of the painting, signed with a big A, is "egg in a snowstorm". Of course it is hanging on the window of the kitchen area, so we all can see it every day. </p>
<p>Amelia went home for a two and a half hour nap(!) ... and so did her mommy ... and I awaited Mirei's arrival, later than usual today as Riku is being taken to his piano lesson by one of the other moms in the group. When Mirei did show up she was obviously more than ready for her nap; we got smiles but there was no hesitation at all when I took her in for her bed. She put both feet up in the air to pull off her socks, making me smile as always, and we had a tiny bit of peek-a-boo with her feet, but within five short minutes I was walking out the door with a little girl all tucked in and sound asleep. </p>
<p>I got to work on the front bedroom, which was used at Christmas Central over the past few weeks. I had a little cleaning to do before Celeste arrived, and the bedding to change once Mirei woke up at 5... a nice hour and a half hour sleep. Of course the first thing I do when she wakens is feed her, and she was sitting enjoying avocado bites when her daddy walked in. He gets big big smiles from her every time, and sat with us while she licked a bit of avocado off her finger, and pointed out various objects to him, that she knows from her walkabouts with Grandpa. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep in the car, with Akane reading, while Bryn picked up mail, their cookie platter from Susan, and Miss Mirei. I did a quick vacuuming on this floor, Doug and I had dinner, and Celeste arrived at 8:10... perfect timing as everything I had to do was done. </p>
<p>I had ordered two devices from Celeste after an email from her came in a few weeks ago describing them. One is good for lower back/hip aches, and the other is for the head... to aid in relaxation and something to do with the cranial sacral points... Celeste's area of expertise. Candy had ordered them too, and was confused as to how to use the one for the head, so off we went for a demonstration. Flat on the carpeted floor, I lay with the hardish bumpy device under the tender indentation in the back of my skull. It was fine, and felt good, so I am to use it as often during the day as I feel the need to. It helps with headaches, tiredness, and for lots of other situations too. From the floor I went up on the bed, while Celeste placed a "wedgie" under my head in the right spot. She made sure it was in the right place, covered my eyes with a soft blanket and left me to relax for as long as it felt comfortable. A half hour later, after having entered what Celeste calls an alpha state, I emerged feeling <strong>very</strong> relaxed and ready for bed! I wasn't really sleeping but felt the way I used to during relaxation classes in West Vancouver. What a feeling... just so relaxed. </p>
<p>Bryn dropped in at 10 P.M. after his ping pong lesson, and demonstrated how he was learning to use his torso to play, standing on his toes and leaning forward, and not swinging with his arms... all the things he has been doing wrong since he and Brent started playing a couple of years ago. </p>
<p>And then we got down to the real business of the day... exchanging stories about what Mirei had done today or last night, and what Riku has been coming out with. I could go on for ages, but one of the highlights of the past twenty-four hours was Bryn watching Mirei in their darkened bedroom, putting herself to sleep. First she got up on all fours and threw out one doll. Then she stood up and tossed another, but missed, so she bent down, grappling in the dark for it, until she found it, and then over it went! She muttered a bit, changed positions a few times, but put her head down and off she went to slumberland. Bryn said she had stood up twice before that and he put her down, but finally decided to leave her to sort it out, and she did! </p>
<p>Garry had Skyped from Montreal today, and I got to tell him the story of being in the car with Riku, who was quite quiet on the way home from school the other day. I asked him what he was thinking of and he said "clouds". He was quite pensive and I asked him what he was thinking about the clouds. His answer: "They are drinking beer."! Akane and I burst out laughing, and of course so did he. That boy likes nothing more than making people laugh out loud at something he has said. </p>
<p>Bryn has some other great stories too, but is going to write them in his blog.. Mirei standing on her own in the bathroom, and Riku's excitement about it, Riku reminding his dad to "stay focused", and Mirei straining to get a look at what Riku had on his plate for dinner, hoping to scarf some of his toast!  You can always ask me about them at some point, if you don't read them somewhere else! </p>
<p>While Celeste unpacked and settled in, I sat and read for a few minutes in the living room, read a few emails, but really wanted to do nothing more than go to bed. I managed to read longer than usual, but the light was out at 11:30. </p>
