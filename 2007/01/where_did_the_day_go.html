								<h2>Where Did the Day Go?</h2>
								<p>At this rate, it will be Christmas in just weeks! I cannot believe how quickly the days pass by; it seems I go from morning breakfast to almost bedtime in far too few hours. I knew the days pass more quickly as we age but this feels like hyper-speed to me. </p>
<p>Mirei and Akane here at 12:15 with the idea being that I would put Mirei down for her nap at 12:30, leave the house at 12:45 for my doula meeting, with Akane leaving at the same time for home, and then meeting Riku at 3 P.M. as always. Doug would be here for Mirei waking around 2:30-3, with me arriving home around that time as well. Ah, how differently all this worked out. Despite two attempts to put Mirei down, she was having none of it. Foolishly, I didn't see if she was the least bit hungry when she first arrived, and it was the first thing I thought of when she wouldn't settle within minutes. I got her up, and she happily ate a very generous bowl of rice cereal. It seemed it should be enough as she had nursed before she arrived, and had eaten at home too, but still she was just not going to settle down. Up she got again, and I fed her avocado, and oatmeal with berries. Finally I had to leave, later than I should have, with the plan now that Akane would settle her down, and Doug would pick Riku up from school. </p>
<p>Off I went, arriving fifteen minutes late, but had a wonderful lunch with our doula coordinator, a maternity nurse of 27 years standing at the SF General. She's warm, low-key, and very much in favour of doulas for every labouring moms who wants one. Two other doulas were there as well, and we chatted about hospital protocol and shifts for us, and learned how to deal with moms who are on illegal drugs or have mental problems, both of which may occur at the General. </p>
<p>We ate at  what is my current favourite neighbourhood restaurant, where I ate with Akane on her birthday. Not having much time to peruse the menu, I settled on a dish I enjoy so much... a "warm bowl" of quinoa, pesto, and tomatoes. I am looking forward to using my Christmas gift certificate from Akane and Bryn over the next few months... or weeks perhaps. </p>
<p>At 2:20 we met at the hospital and had a tour of the maternity ward. I have been there before but had forgotten some of the details... the locked codes for various rooms and how to work the controls on the beds... amazing beds! There were four births taking place and Monnie told us what was going on with each birth... the stage, the circumstances, and what the many acronyms stood for. </p>
<p>As I was pulling into the garage at 3:10, it hit me that Doug could not have picked up Riku since I had the car! Egad! I dashed upstairs to learn that Mirei had <strong>not</strong> napped!... not for five minutes the entire day, and that Bryn had been called at work to pick Riku up... just fifteen minutes late, thank goodness. </p>
<p>So, there I was at 3:30, once more feeding Mirei... and she finally napped for an hour and a half.</p>
<p>While she napped, Akane, Riku, Doug, and I opened the Christmas gifts that arrived from Toronto yesterday. Kelly bought five books for the children, all just perfect for Riku, and for Mirei to grow into. Riku sat while I read each one to him, and then asked for "What Happens if You Give a Mouse a Cookie" twice. "Ferdinand the Bull" was a favourite too, and they all went home with them. They have a very full bookcase, but Riku so enjoys his books. While I was reading to him tonight, he wrapped his arm around my neck and said solemnly, "I really like you Nana". </p>
<p> We also had birthday and Christmas gifts for Mirei that hadn't been opened, so Akane opened all of those while Doug and I opened our Canadian books, all carefully chosen by Kelly. Bryn and Caillie made us a beautifully coloured bowl, one of my very favourite gifts from the children. I have such a lovely collection already, and one day perhaps I won't need any more bowls, mugs, or small platters than the ones our grandchildren made for us. Mirei did not long sleep long enough, just an hour and a half, but in time for her daddy walking in the door right then to take them all home at 5:30. Instead however, Mirei, the starving girl, insisted on nursing immediately, and Riku was hungry so he ate dinner here, working on some buildings with his dad, using the magnetic blocks. We all said goodnight to each other at 6:45. Mirei can now spot me at the window and looks up to see me in the light.</p>
<p>Oh, yesterday we were watching the leaves blow from the bedroom window, and I made a whirling motion with my hand for the action. It was windy again today, and I turned Mirei's chair in the kitchen so she could see the leaves while she ate; she immediately put both hands up in the air, waving them about with quite a different motion that she uses for the more gentle butterfly demo. And this afternoon she obviously remembered that we had been putting our hands up in the air, for "up!" and then lowering them for "down", and proceeded to have her mommy and me follow her this time... over and over again. She's quick, this girl! </p>
<p>I relaxed with the sacral therapy tools Celeste brought for me, both of which completely relax me in a very short time. Perhaps it helps that I am just lying quietly in the dark with not a sound to be heard, but most likely it is the combination of both of these that does the trick. </p>
<p>Doug was at T'ai Chi this evening, came home and had a quick dinner, and got right back to work at a project for work with a deadline. </p>
<p>After Celeste arrived home, she had Doug use the knobby device on his head, lying flat out on the floor. He totally relaxed but in his case having his temples stroked and then his earlobes rubbed absolutely caused him to breathe deeply and "sink" into the pressure exerted by this strange looking device. </p>
<p>I watched a couple of Oprah tapes and headed for bed early tonight... before 11 P.M.</p>
