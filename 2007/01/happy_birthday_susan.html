								<h2>Happy Birthday, Susan!</h2>
								<p>Today is Susan's birthday! I awoke to find a message from her letting me know we were indeed booked in for lunch at Zuni Caf√© at 11:30 today. What a treat... lunch out mid-week at one of my very favourite restaurants, and one that Susan enjoys too. She thinks the last time we were there was for my birthday two years ago, and I think I have been there once or twice since then, just not often enough! I always know what I am going to have... the bowl of creamy polenta, with a little of both cheeses... gorgonzola and parmesan, plus a salad, Acme sourdough bread, and Judy Rodgers' signature chocolate cake. However, Susan ordered the puree of root vegetable soup, and I should have had that instead of the salad. It was delicious and how I would have loved to have dunked my bread into that! We had a great waiter and on cue he brought our one slice of cake from the kitchen with a single candle on it. Perfect. I had a small bouquet of red tulips for Susan, but forgot to give her the birthday card! Shall have to do that at our Sunday morning belated birthday party when the children can be there to see her blow out the candles and share in some cake too. Kevin was in charge of dinner at home tonight, so that Amelia could be there to celebrate too. Susan made her own cheesecake last night, and Amelia helped decorate it today. </p>
<p>Amelia phoned to tell me all about it after arriving home from school. What a treat it was to hear her voice on the phone; she started the conversation off by saying "I love you Nana." Sweet words indeed! We had quite a little chat, about school and what she did today, and hung up saying we would see each other soon. </p>
<p>Akane arrived at 3 P.M. with Mirei, who looked perky and happy and not the least bit tired and in need of a nap. Riku has his group piano lesson today after school and so Mirei gets here later than usual on Wednesdays. She had a busy time, standing on her own in the living room to start off, looking adorable in a denim skirt over a pair of Amelia's old tights, and a sweater of Amelia's too. However, the skirt had to come off, as she kept slipping while trying to stand up as it caught under her knees. I did get a photo of her outfit, though, as she looked ever so cute. We had lots of fun together. I pretend to chase her and she scurries off turning to check to see where I am; we both laugh out loud, and then off she goes again.</p>
<p>We played for a while upstairs today, as it was warmer up there. It's chilly today, although bright and sunny. I lay on the bed reading, watching while she busied herself with the phone locater button, and pulling out all the books from her basket in our room. Oh, Mirei climbed all the way upstairs by herself today! She has been practicing for a few weeks now, but would get just two or three stairs up and decide to turn around. Today, however, she just kept going and then turned at the top and clapped along with me. A big accomplishment! </p>
<p>When I thought it was close to her nap time (she had slept at home for a half hour this morning and for another hour later on), I prepared a nice big bowl of oatmeal for her, complete with blueberries, mashed banana, and flax seed. As always, I could not believe how much she ate! I have adult friends who wouldn't have eaten that much for lunch! </p>
<p>For the second day in a row she fought her nap for a few minutes, but only a few. She was a tired girl, and slept from 5:10 until 6:15. This worked out well for everyone, as Bryn picked up Akane and Riku after Riku's class, and they all went out for a noodle dinner. </p>
<p>Doug called through on Skype just as Mirei was finishing up her post-nap meal; this time she ate two small bowls of corn with rice, a half slice of buttered toast, and a small bowl of my leftover polenta, which she really liked as well. She could hear his voice and answered so loudly that he could hear her! I brought her over to the computer so she could see Doug's photo up on the screen, and what a riot this was. She burst into big smiles when he spoke to her, she waggled her fingers at him, kept grinning away at him, and they "talked" back and forth to each other. He would make a noise and she would squeal back at him. Talk about a mutual admiration society! This was something to see! </p>
<p>While Mirei was eating one of her meals today, she noticed the wind blowing the trees very hard; she used her fairly new sign for "trees" by waving her fingers back and forth up high across her forehead. When I pointed out the trees last week to her it was a windy day, so I used that sign for her, and now I guess trees will always be shown as blowing! As long as we both know what she means and can tell others, we're doing just fine. It is quite a different sign than she uses for butterflies... on her slippers and on the wall hanging, as she keeps her hands lower, and waggles her fingers up and down. Clever girl! </p>
<p>Yesterday Mirei just moved right on past my computer when she was told "no, no" as she looked tempted by the flashing green button, but today she decided not only would she go for it again, but is also determined to use the keyboard now too. What a girl! She has grown tall enough that she can pull it out and start typing away before I notice and how she loves it! I really have to be careful to have it all shut down or I will end up losing things that shouldn't be lost! </p>
<p>Bryn tucked Riku into bed and picked Mirei up at 7:15. She had been playing on her own in the children's bedroom, having discovered Riku's cars. She was in there for ten minutes, and I managed to snap a few photos of her; I'm amazed that at this early age Mirei often manages to keep herself happy and occupied. </p>
<p>Today she stood looking at her two books in front of the coffee table for the longest time, before getting down to crawl to me and see what was happening in the kitchen. Riku was very much like this as well, and still is. Anyway, as soon as she heard her daddy announce himself, she called out "Dada, dada, dada!" and met him in the hallway. Mirei gives big hugs now, and it's very sweet to see this little girl and her daddy so happy to see each other. He is so proud of her and thinks she is the perfect little girl. I'm sure he's right. </p>
<p>Akane had sent over a nicely prepared meal for me, all set to heat up, but I had already eaten some "chicken" vegetable and noodle soup I made up yesterday in the midst of the mess of clearing out the freezer. That was the perfect dinner for me after my hearty lunch, and I now have a meal all set to go tomorrow. </p>
<p>Chore today for Akane and me: we both cleaned out and cleared out our fridge shelves. I had done mine fairly recently so it was a quick job for me, but I also got my ironing out of the way for the week. </p>
<p>Bed too late tonight... midnight already!</p>
