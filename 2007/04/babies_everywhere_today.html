								<h2>Packing Up ... and Babies Everywhere Today!</h2>
								<p>What a gorgeous day for a walk with Finn. The packers were at his house today, and it was so busy with four men scurrying about, packing up Susan and Kevin's household. It was foggy on the far side of the city, and when Finn and I set out from Ashbury Street, I was bundled up with a big sweater and a light scarf around my neck. However, three hours and fifteen minutes later, I had the sweater and the scarf both off and was enjoying the clear blue skies and warm sunshine. </p>
<p>It was another perfect day in Golden Gate Park. I must make it a point to get out there, even though access from their new house won't be nearly so convenient. Doug and I may just have to set out for walks, and perhaps I can arrange some playtime there with Riku and Amelia too, once she doesn't need to nap after school. </p>
<p>Before heading to Stow Lake, I took a stroll through the rose garden, and saw the first roses of the season. Finn was sleeping and I stopped to not only smell the roses, but to take a few photos too. A half hour later, we were circumnavigating the lake. We saw goslings, the now slightly bigger baby ducks from last week, lots of squirrels, turtles of course, sunning on logs in the water, and even a gopher, popping his head in and out of a small hole, much to the amusement of a group of young children out on a walk in the park. </p>
<p>Finn slept a good part of the time, but to my surprise he also was awake and content, looking at the leaves on the trees and the sky from his vantage point. I also got some very sweet smiles from him when I caught his eye; he's getting to the stage where he can entertain himself with just the visuals in his world. </p>
<p>He had nursed at home and likely would have been fine waiting until we got home, but I decided to stop and give him a bottle of breast milk at the DeYoung Museum sculpture garden. He had just started to fuss and I wasn't sure how busy the house would be when I returned. Finn was quite happy for the first five minutes of the bottle but then was ready to give it up. He slept all the way back home, right up to the door, when he started crying for the real thing. </p>
<p>Susan had picked up a variety of delicious sandwiches for the crew, and I was lucky enough to have been included. Mine was brie with pear slices on a wonderful walnut grainy long roll; yum! Finn nursed, and I had some time holding him too; he had big smiles for his Daddy, who was wandering in and out, checking on the packing. </p>
<p>I headed home for a cup of tea, which I had along with my favourite nutty sticky bun Susan had saved for me. I watched an Oprah with my feet up, perfectly happy with my day... lots of exercise, smiles from Finn, and a full tummy. </p>
<p>Amelia, Susan, and Finn arrived about 3:30, with the idea that Amelia would have her nap here, and perhaps join Susan on the trip to the airport to pick up her mom. Even though Amelia dropped off many times into a sleep, the minute Susan tried to leave the room, she was sitting up insisting she wasn't tired. The solution finally was to have her stay here with me, while Finn went to the airport for Oma. </p>
<p>This worked out so well. First we sat in the living room and read two new books, and then Amelia and I spent a half hour in the garden, sweeping and cleaning up. I pointed out some spit bugs to her, which totally fascinated her, and kept her busy finding more of them. She had asked if she could have a tub here so that was next on the agenda. All of the animals from the red tin went in with her, and she played happily, chatting away to them, until I thought Susan would be on her way to pick her up. I had a pair of "glow in the dark" bug PJs Riku had outgrown and they fit Amelia perfectly; she was thrilled with them and anxious to see them glowing later on at home in the dark. </p>
<p>I suggested we go outside with the chalk and do some drawing until Susan arrived. Due to a lost parking ticket and a problem with camera surveillance(!) at the airport, they were held up there for over a half hour, with Finn screaming bloody murder in the parked car. Just what Susan needed to finish off this already too-hectic day. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amelia and I were covering our driveway with everyone's names! I would print a name and Amelia would do the letters along with me. We printed up Daddy, Mommy, Oma, Finn, Bryn, Riku, Lynne, and Nana, ending with Grandpa. Amelia is a great little printer and really concentrates on getting the letters right. There were lots of Ys for her today and she improved quickly after the first attempt. It was chilly, but we were wearing scarves, and when everyone arrived, she went running to give Oma a big hug. I was happy to learn later that Amelia didn't fall asleep on the way home, as Susan feared she might, and was very excited to explore her new house and see her new room. </p>
<p>Doug was at his T'ai Chi class, so I took a cup of tea upstairs and watched the end of an Oprah show, before settling in with Doug for a wonderful Irish movie we had rented. Perfect ending to this day, as we both enjoyed it so much.</p>
