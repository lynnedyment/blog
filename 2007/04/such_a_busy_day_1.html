								<h2>Such a Busy Day!</h2>
								<p>Mirei arrived before 8 A.M. today, as usual, looking ever so "indie" in her striped tights, a bright pink top, and navy blue cut-offs. It's fun seeing the clothing choices her daddy puts together! She got right to work taking apart a kitchen cupboard while I made her second breakfast. Where this girl puts the food leaves us all shaking our heads in wonder!  </p>
<p>We went off to an appointment downtown at 9:25, and Mirei was asleep ten minutes later. While I was at the dermatologist, she slept while her Grandpa read in the car. The rest of the day was typical: busy girl, busy Nana. She has discovered a box of wooden sticks in a lower cupboard that she likes to dump out, but today helped me put them back too. Yes, we sing the "clean up" song, but often she is off and busy with another project before the last one is cleaned up. Today she helped me with the laundry, putting socks and underwear into the dryer, one by one, as I handed them to her. </p>
<p>Mirei had a second nap for an hour and a half starting at 2:30, perfect timing as it gave me a chance to make a banana bread for Kevin, and get two casseroles made up... one for Ashbury Street, and one for home. </p>
<p>Today, after I went in to say hello to her (once I heard her voice on the monitor), she stayed on the bed and played for at least a half hour on her own. All her dogs were lined up; she was covering some up with a blanket, and just generally keeping herself entertained. The bed is low and I don't worry about her hurting herself, even if she did fall off, as the past few days she has been climbing up on the living room chair and then standing(!) ... a big "no no"... I take her down each time she stands on it, and on the red chair in the kitchen, too. </p>
<p>Her new trick today was to get up on the chair, and then get onto the play table too! A second new trick (she's full of them these days) was to get herself up on one of the big kitchen chairs by standing first on the crossbars. Mirei is up for every challenge. I think she decided to do this today after watching me standing on a chair to put some dishes away. This little girl needs to be watched very carefully; she takes far more risks than her brother did, and isn't happy to be thwarted in her endeavours either! </p>
<p>Mirei was quite clingy while I finished up the casseroles, and I realized she was ready for her big afternoon snack. I scrambled two eggs and made some toast, and she was a happy girl. There's always a reason if this girl is fussy! No crackers for this gal; she wants a meal mid-afternoon!</p>
<p>Kevin picked us up at 5 P.M. for an evening at Ashbury Street. Doug had a class and Bryn had a late conference call, so off we went, for some time with Amelia, Finn, and Susan while Kevin went off to dinner and a play with Nancy and friends. Susan had made a delicious macaroni and cheese dinner, so will save the Mexican casserole I had brought for other meals. I held Finn, who was mostly quiet and happy, while Susan bathed the two girls. Finn was smiling and then a little fussy, but easily distracted. I sat on the exercise ball and bounced him for a bit as I've seen Susan do many times. </p>
<p>With the girls in their PJs, we all sat down to dinner. Bryn came in soon after and joined us, and had some Finn time too. He seems to have a knack of keeping Finn happy and calm, which gave Susan time to eat, while I watched the two girls wandering from room to room.  Mirei was quite thrilled with Amelia's little shopping cart and pushed that around for a while; she was quite determined to get into it at one point, but her legs are far too short for that! It didn't stop her from trying though, many times. </p>
<p>The rest of the evening flew by: Bryn and Mirei left for home, Amelia and I worked a long time on a 60-piece puzzle... she's good at finding the right pieces(!), and it took us a long time to finish up. I'm not great at puzzles, but it was fun to just sit and work at it together. Susan had been trying unsuccessfully to get Finn to nap, and also cleaned up the kitchen while we did the puzzle.</p>
<p>Then it was tuck-in time for Amelia; Susan got her ready, while I held Finn... got some great shots of him, I hope, on his tummy holding his head way up(!), and had lots of sweet smiles from him too. </p>
<p>At just past 9 P.M., Amelia and I were snuggled in while I read her two stories, and then the coughing started. Amelia must have coughed three times a minute for the next hour, finally drifting off to sleep just after 10 o'clock. She had been sleeping on and off throughout that time, but it obviously wasn't an easy or deep sleep. Both she and Finn have been coughing for a couple of weeks now, and there seems no end in sight to it. </p>
<p>I left the room at 10:15 to find Doug in the dining room reading. He was there to pick me up, and Susan had gone to bed just before 10, after finally settling Finn, giving Doug some rice pudding, and spending a few minutes on her computer. She is one busy woman these days, with not enough sleep under her belt to manage it all. But somehow she does it. </p>
<p>Amelia coughed and called out again at 10:30, so I lay with her until Kevin arrived at 11:15. Parking is tight around that area, and so we let him know where Doug was parked and then I had a minute to say goodnight to Kevin. Amelia was awake; she heard her dad come in... and was ready to sleep with him. I hope they both slept well. </p>
<p>Came home to a darling message on the answering machine from Bryn. Before going to bed, at 9 o'clock, Bryn thought he would "top" her off with some more food... she had eaten mac' and cheese at Susan's, some pinto beans, and a little sweet potato, but it wasn't enough, of course, so at home she polished off steamed broccoli, a bowl of oatmeal with raisins and milk, yogurt, and some "super food" drink!!! I could hear her giggling as she played with Bryn's lip, and saved the message. It was just too cute to delete. Less than two minutes after the call, Bryn said she was sound asleep in her crib. Busy day, busy girls... all of us!</p>
