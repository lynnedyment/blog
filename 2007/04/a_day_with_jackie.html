								<h2>A Day with Jackie and a Hampshire Street Evening</h2>
								<p>Once again, the plans for my day did not pan out as expected. This is becoming par for the course it seems lately, although almost always the day is enjoyable...  but in a completely unexpected way. </p>
<p>I wanted to walk Finn this morning, but when I called Susan at 9:20, his Oma already had him out for this first nap. Getting up and out of the house for a walk at 9 A.M. seems harder than it should these days. I really must start getting to bed earlier, so that I have more energy first thing in the morning! Rushing about is not very appealing to me right now, especially in the early part of the day. </p>
<p>Last night I had mentioned to Jackie, Brent's mother, that perhaps she and Brian might like to join us on our walk to Stow Lake. They had never done it, and it was supposed to be another gorgeous day. Brian was busy with a household chore for Brent when I called today, but Jackie was more than happy to have plans that included a long walk. I picked her up at Brent's and off we went, parking across from the Flower Conservatory, and continuing along my usual route to the rose garden and on to Stow Lake. Jackie enjoyed it all so much; we are both walkers and our pace was very similar, so the time flew by. </p>
<p>I had hoped to meet up with Susan, her mom, and Finn at the outside café for lunch at the DeYoung Museum in the park, but had only been able to leave a message. Another plan foiled, as the café is closed on Mondays! We waited until just after 12:30 in case they did arrive, but when it was clear that they wouldn't be joining us after all, we set out to find another nice spot for lunch. The little French bakery/cafe in the Haight Street district was also closed on Monday, so I headed back to our own neighbourhood. This was a good idea, since I thought Jackie might enjoy a "California" food experience, and took her to the wonderful "Café Gratitude" I have written about before. It was perfect: not only did Jackie thoroughly enjoy the food, but she got a big kick out of the decor and the theme of this "new age" raw food experience. </p>
<p>We shared a salad: "I Am Satisfied" (mixed organic greens, slivered carrots, beets, tomatoes, sprouts with Brazil nut "Parmesan", and sesame seeds). The restaurant is strictly vegan. The salad was delicious, and we both enjoyed my favourite "I Am Graceful" warm bowl of steamed quinoa and pesto with fresh hemp seed pesto, tomatoes, and sprouts. We also shared a slice of key lime pie, with a wonderful macadamia nut and coconut crust, held together by soaked "Irish moss", a natural thickener. It was all <em>so</em> good.</p>
<p>We dashed back over to the other side of town to pick up Riku from school. Jackie got to see his classroom and teacher, and he gave her a big happy smile when he spotted her. He agreed to sing her a couple of songs in Japanese, at her request, and was pretty silly on the way back to Brent's, but was asleep by the time we got there. </p>
<p>Rather than take home such a sleepy and newly awakened fellow, I brought him home with me. Doug lay him down on the bed, and I took off his shoes, but he was awake almost instantly and we just giggled away, snuggling and cuddling, until he was ready to get up and do some drawing. Instead he tidied up the little desk in the kitchen (Mirei doesn't leave it tidied up at all and it bothers him to see pencil crayons in the wrong places, paper scattered about, etc.), and then decided he would make us "dinner". Riku asked if he could use a white pillowcase as a table cloth which was fine, and then every few minutes would call out that dinner would be "ready in a few minutes" or "dinner will be ready very soon!" </p>
<p>He had it all set up so nicely for us; he has always had this knack for proper table setting... it's an interesting trait, I think. When we were called to the table, we both had very different meals laid out for us; they were all plastic foods, of course, and Doug had white rice, a thick slice of white bread, a fried egg, and a piece of cucumber, which they referred to as a pickle. </p>
<p>I had a "veggie" burger... we had had a little discussion about my not eating "hamburger" as he was preparing all of this. His exact words were, "Come on Nana, it's a new taste. You might like it!" but I assured him that I did not want to eat meat. It promptly became a "veggie" burger. I also had a cob of corn, a carrot, and a clump of French fries. We did have another discussion about what foods contain fiber, and are good and not so good for us. We've been talking about this a lot lately. Yup, he's a Dyment! </p>
<p>Oh, we both had drinks too; mine was hot tea with "lots of milk Nana, but you don't like sugar in it right?" Doug got juice since Riku knows he doesn't drink tea or coffee. And because we ate most of our dinners, we got ice cream cones for dessert! Riku didn't eat with us, he just watched over us, hovering, to make sure we had everything we wanted... "You like pepper with that?" What great pleasure he takes in not only making sure that we are enjoying it all, but in just putting it all together for us. Not to mention taking the middle photograph below ... a budding photographer!</p>
<p>He and I walked over to his place at a fairly brisk pace to get there for 5:30. It is always a pleasure to walk with Riku; he points out everything that catches his attention... a contrail, some birds eating seeds on the lawns, and commenting on it all. We both said hello to the friendly man at the garage on the corner of Potrero Avenue, and he greeted his sister with big hugs and kisses and she returned his enthusiasm with big smiles and beams for me too. </p>
<p>Bryn left with Akane at 5:45 for her third last class in Cantonese, and I sat at the table and fed the children the dinner Akane had left for them. When Bryn returned we both sat with them, talking, bragging, and entertaining them, a very easy thing to do with these two. Mirei had lots of arm actions going as she looked at one of her favourite song books, with hands over her head and swaying from side to side. </p>
<p>Bryn wanted to show me how she is learning her letters, so put six or seven magnetic letters on her tray and asked her where the O was. She immediately picked it up! Then came a K and they had all been mixed up both times. Riku is very proud of her and says "good girl" when she gets it right. Oh, she'll be learning them all before long is my guess, with all this support and encouragement! </p>
<p>I got Riku ready for bed, reading him two stories, and Bryn got Mirei into her PJs, ready for her bed too. She hadn't napped enough today, and could barely keep her eyes open. Riku started coughing in bed, and it was just after 8 before he finally stopped and fell into a sleep. Mirei had fallen asleep much earlier. </p>
<p>Doug arrived with a burrito for his dinner; Bryn had eaten a big lunch, and I finished off the last of the children's whole wheat gnocchi. We sat at the table and heard about Bryn's and Akane's summer plans... two weeks in Japan at the end of July and then a month in Beijing, with a full-time nanny speaking Mandarin to Akane and the children, while Bryn works. It will be an exciting adventure, but it's going to be a long summer for me, with so little contact with them, especially with my trip to Ontario tacked on at the end of it all. </p>
<p>I was really really tired at the end of this day; I could barely keep my eyes open for the one hour taped show we watched... and in fact didn't, and had to replay ten minutes of it again. Lights out at 11 o'clock. </p>
