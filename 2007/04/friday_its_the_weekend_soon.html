								<h2>Friday... It's Almost the Weekend!</h2>
								<p>Mirei woke at 6:50 this morning, having slept ten solid hours with no waking at all. Lovely for her, but not for her Nana, who really does have to go to bed earlier with this little one in my life. We played in bed for a half hour. How interesting that, like her brother, she isn't ready to bounce out of bed if there is someone to play with. </p>
<p>Food intake again today was unbelievable... dry cereal and apple, oatmeal with banana and blueberries, fried egg, bacon, and a little toast. Two-hour nap... 11:30â€“1:30... ate brown rice/veggie dish... ate every bite, plus a big serving of spinach mixed in with it. Custard with applesauce for dessert. Snack... goldfish crackers, just because she spotted them (I put out a little dish for them beside her water bottle and she was quite pleased with this arrangement), and a yogurt when she saw me eating one. </p>
<p>Susan called, asking if Amelia could visit for a little while, as she was having car problems and didn't want Amelia to have to hang around a garage. Amelia and Mirei played in the bedroom for a while with the baskets of animals, then sat on the bed together "reading" books. </p>
<p>Susan was back within an hour, with a very fussy Finn. He needed nursing and some time at  his little seat, but he was overtired and ready for sleep when they finally left. I carried a tired Amelia down to the car; she had been at school with a full day behind her, and usually is napping by 3:30. </p>
<p>Mirei and I went outside and did some gardening together. What a busy girl she was, sweeping, inspecting the small pile of leaves and branches, and digging the dirt with her fingers. Her mother would not have been impressed, but how she enjoys it all. She stops to look at the trees blowing and does her little sign for that, returning to watch out for the blue jays and clicking away whenever she heard me doing so. I managed to get one plant potted with lavender, a pink geranium, and flock, a pretty lacy white flower for the edges. </p>
<p>Mirei ate a <strong>huge</strong> helping of the Mexican casserole for her dinner, along with an adult-sized portion of steamed broccoli, all eaten with a fork. She is very good at spearing food with it, and very pleased when she does. Of course fingers work fine too, sometimes with both hands. Dessert tonight was plain custard, the way that Riku likes it best. Just three more days until he is home! I miss him soooo much. </p>
<p>Mirei has been learning to drink out of a small cup or glass lately, and really loves to do it, but she often misses it completely by putting her whole mouth around the lip of the glass and not just her lips. She does a great job, but today I felt she had had enough water, and so took the glass away. Is she strong! Bryn is amazed at how hard it is to take something from her when she is determined to hold on to it. What really surprised me today was her saying "No! No! No!" when I managed to, and then she banged her hand flat on the table. Oh my! It's funny, really, but it just shows us how different she is from her mellow brother.  </p>
<p>I distracted her by asking if she would like a splashy bath and of course that did the trick. How she loves her tub time and cries every time I take her out. Riku still loves to be wrapped and snuggled in a big warm towel, but not Miss Mirei. She has to sit in the tub until the last bit of water has gone down the drain (she watches it carefully), and then still protests about getting out. Her toes and finger tips are always wrinkled, so it's not as though she's in and out! </p>
<p>Of course after her tub, and lots of cream on her pom pom (her tummy, which she loves to pat), and into her PJs, it was time to top her off for the night. So, two scrambled eggs later, with toast and vanilla soy milk, it was off to bed. </p>
<p>Originally, the idea was for Bryn to take her home for the night with him, but it looked as though it was going to be around 9:30, much too late to keep her up. I didn't feel like sitting over at their place, as I had things to do here, so I just tucked her in at 8 o'clock. She was sound asleep in three and a half minutes tonight! The secret now? I hold her close, sing very quietly, and rock her, and it does the trick. The days of just lying her down in this bed are over, as she knows, even when she's tired, how easy it is to move around on the big bed. </p>
<p>After tidying up and making tea, Gail and I worked on our family tree until 10 o'clock, and I continued on for another hour. Bedtime for me right after that, at 11:30.</p>
