								<h2>It's Friday! Yahoo! ... and a New Baby in the World</h2>
								<p>Well, today did not turn out at all the way I expected it to. My intention was to get over to Waller Street for several hours to help with the unpacking and/or to take Finn for a long morning walk. However, Doug had plans to go to Marin county to a sale as well, and left before I was ready to get out the door. The plan was then for me to go as soon as he got back, but that was much later than expected too, at 1 o'clock, leaving me without enough time to be of any use to Susan at all. It's Friday and I wanted to pick Riku up from school an hour earlier than he is usually out, and have some running-around-outside time. </p>
<p>Instead I had a full morning and part afternoon at home, working at various chores... paper work, emails, laundry, tidying, etc. It was great, as it was time I hadn't planned on having. Candy called to say that she had had the angioplasty done on her leg. It was scheduled for Monday morning, but instead they called her in to get it done <strong>now</strong>. I am sure they were worried enough about that clot that they didn't want to leave it in over the weekend. Scary. It went well: Candy is a bit sore, but the clot is gone. </p>
<p>Riku and I met Akane and Mirei at the DeYoung Museum as planned. I had forgotten my camera, but Akane took a few shots for me; Riku so enjoys the little sculpture garden at the museum, and "posed" for a few photos there. </p>
<p>Mirei gave us big smiles; she had been in her stroller long enough, and was as happy as could be to get out as soon as we reached the "<em>blue</em>"playground across the street. How that child loves wandering about under her own steam, now that she can walk and move where she wants to. This mostly meant trying hard to get up on the playground equipment with Riku, struggling with all her might to get up the ladders, up the steps, down the steps, and all on her own, too. Mirei's careful; Akane was holding on tightly to her wrist at one point, but relaxed after realizing that Mirei doesn't take chances. She is bold, though, and carefully navigated her own way down some steps, standing up and going backwards. She's amazing! </p>
<p>Oh yes, Mirei is also quite the charmer. There was a little boy standing near her at one point, and Mirei toddled over to him, wrapping her arms around him. She lay her head against his chest and just stood there, as did he... no doubt wondering what in the world was going on! Then she puckered up and made it clear she wanted to kiss him, which she did, smack on the cheek... she had to stretch up to do this. I finally had to unhinge her from him, although he was still just standing there allowing himself to be manhandled. It was adorable, and his mom told him he was such a handsome boy that the girls couldn't keep away. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Riku was in his glory, up and down the play equipment, trying hard to get Mirei to follow him, before heading off with me into the "forest", a little wooded area where he has played with Amelia in the past. We pretend there are dragons hiding behind trees, and armed with "swords" we go quietly up and down the little pathways. Today a four-year-old Japanese boy joined us for a few minutes, and it was interesting to hear them speaking only English to each other. They went running around in the larger playground area for a while as well. </p>
<p>Riku took such delight in pushing Mirei on the swing today. It was the first time he has done this, and he was so cautious with her, pushing not too far and not too fast. What a wonderful brother she has! She got big kisses and hugs when he first spotted her, and he is continuously kind and thoughtful with her. </p>
<p>Riku spotted another statue on the way back to the car; we had inspected one on the way to the museum, but Akane noticed this second one was of Mr. Starr-King, which is the name of the school Riku will be going to in September! </p>
<p>Dropped everyone at home close to 5. Mirei had dozed off in the car for about five minutes, slept all the way up the stairs in my arms, and came back instantly to full energy the minute we walked in the door. </p>
<p>Quiet evening at home, working on our family tree with Gail. Doug and Bryn went off to a 9:30 movie, but first Bryn demonstrated how Mirei had saved herself from a potentially bad fall off his lap... throwing out her hands to protect her face from hitting flat on the floor... fast reflexes(!) and then told a hilarious story of how she had managed to squeeze into a space behind Riku's chair, by <em>pushing</em> it forward, while he was sitting in it(!), and then squeezing behind it, all the while holding on to it! She is unbelievably strong, this little girl. </p>
<p>After they left, I sat at this machine until 11:30, struggling with one family of two marriages and many children, and not winning the battle. Lights out an hour later. </p>
<p>Notes: Nicole Long sent an email with photos of her darling baby boy, James Connor, born April 22 and weighing 8 pounds, 12 ounces! She and James looked thrilled and happy with this beautiful boy.</p>
