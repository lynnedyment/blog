								<h2>Welcome Home... Riku and Akane!</h2>
								<p>In some ways the fourteen days since Akane and Riku flew off to Japan have flown by, and in some ways it feels like forever. I know that Mirei will be a very happy girl to see her Mommy again, and her brother too, and Riku will have missed his Daddy and his sister, and just maybe his Nana and Grandpa as well. I certainly missed that little face of his around here, although his sister kept me busy while he was gone. Again today, she was challenging me by standing in the chair, and then sitting down fast when I spotted her! This time I managed to capture that look on camera. </p>
<p>Bryn went off to the airport on his own to meet them for their 10:45 A.M. arrival. Mirei was napping, and it meant she would be ready for action when they arrived. Akane was very tired after the flight, and went home to bed before Mirei woke, but Riku came bursting in, just delighted to see his sister walking out of her room and down the hallway to meet him. It was a very sweet meeting as he wrapped his arms around Mirei and told her he missed her <strong>so</strong> much, and then said, "You growed up!" It was adorable. </p>
<p>Mirei was grinning away at him, and reached out to take hold of a Lego set he had in his hand. He said to her, "It's okay if you break it; I won't mind." I'm sure later on he will be putting it out of her reach, but meanwhile he was happy to be in her company again. </p>
<p>I was waiting for a hug from him, but first he had to run to the window to wave goodbye to his parents. Then he had to tell me all about his new Ultraman toys, and show me all his treasures from his backpack that he had on the plane with him. Then I got a big hug. He looks more grown up to me; funny how that happens when time goes by without seeing a young child. Riku's new short hair cut adds to this older look too. </p>
<p>The children played in the garden, sweeping a little, Riku sitting on the small deck chair he remembered from last year, and Mirei digging in the garden. She spent quite a bit of time today figuring out how to sit on the tiny edge of the bricks. She did it, and I took a series of pics of her doing so, turning ever so carefully around, and finally sitting quite nicely after all the rigamarole! </p>
<p>I put out some snacks on the little stool, and they happily ate freshly baked banana bread and enjoyed some cold drinks for a picnic. Riku has always loved this and how wonderful that he arrived home on a sunny warm day so we could do it. </p>
<p>Later on we came in and went upstairs so they could play with the blocks and car sets together. I just sat on the bed watching them interact. Riku is so amazed that Mirei walks "all the time!" There were lots of hugs and kisses exchanged today, moreso than usual. They missed each other for sure! </p>
<p>Akane came over in the late afternoon, and that little girl was delighted to see her Mommy, and to nurse again. Akane had pumped while she was away and no doubt within a day or two her milk supply will be back to normal. Mirei will no doubt be very demanding in this regard, as I'm sure she must have wondered where her mom and her brother were all this time. </p>
<p>We all walked back to Hampshire Street together, with Akane taking Mirei off to do a little shopping for dinner tonight, while I took Riku to the small playground on 24th Street. He was having a grand time climbing on the serpent there, going right to the top and jumping off from various spots, but at one lower point, just as I turned to look the other way, his foot slipped and down he slid. He had scraped his face and was crying, so I held him and carried him home as requested. Of course, he was tired and upset so promptly fell asleep, making him feel much heavier than he does when awake and holding himself up on my hip. </p>
<p>We waited at the door for Bryn to come home for work, so he could carry him up the three flights of stairs. I did try to rouse him, knowing he would have to have his dinner before bedtime, but he was having none of it. Later on, Bryn IM'd to tell me that he couldn't waken him either, just too tired after that long trip, so he put him right into bed. </p>
<p>Akane was too tired to go to her Chinese class as well of course, so Doug and I had the evening at home, while everyone at Riku's house went to bed early. It was an exciting day, but I was so sad to see Riku with his scraped face at the end of it all. He so rarely hurts himself and to have it be so visible seemed so awful to me. </p>
<p>Gail and I worked on our family tree, I answered some emails, and off I went to bed at midnight.</p>
