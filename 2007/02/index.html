								<h2><a href="/2007/02/a_doula_day_1.html">A Doula Day ... and Tub Time at Hampshire Street</a></h2>
								<p>My day started out in a very special way, as Riku had joined me for breakfast at 8:15, a rare and special treat. He and I both had oatmeal with fruit and almonds, and then there was time for a balloon toss in the hallway for about fifteen minutes. It was a good excuse to get up and in the shower immediately, instead of puttering about on the computer for a while. </p>
<p>The timing was perfect as today was a very exciting day for me. After lots of preparation to become a doula, and having participated in a doula capacity for four grandchildren, I finally got to the next step and volunteered as a doula at the S.F. General hospital. I've been going to the meetings, reading all the emails to keep up with the local SFGH doula news but, with life so busy in general, I just hadn't signed up for a regular shift. I had, however, put my name on the <em>call</em> list, and today was here when they needed a doula. </p>
<p>The labouring mom was  5 cm dilated when they called at 11;15 A.M. and by the time I arrived fifteen minutes later she was at 6. I was sorry to hear she had been there on her own since 8 o'clock. Since she really needed some support once her labour intensified, she asked the staff to call a social worker she has some contact with, so this gal was there when I arrived. </p>
<p>We made a good team. We were on each side of the mom, with me stroking her back and arms, or rubbing her lower back, while the other gal gave her water and held cold cloths to her head. Having a baby is hard work, and she was in a lot of pain, but handled it all very well. She was so responsive to suggestions about relaxing between contractions and then blowing her way through them; it was good to see the change take place. End labour was very fast and at 1 p.m. she delivered a beautiful baby boy, a brother for two young sisters. </p>
<p>I took some photos of them, and stayed with her for a half hour before saying goodbye. The baby was still nestled on her chest, nursing happily, and with a very happy smiling mommy. How wonderful it see the baby not whisked away for eye drops, a bath, weighing, measuring, etc. but instead got to snuggle in skin to skin next to his mommy, and would be allowed to stay there for as long as she chose. They wiped him off and cut the cord so that he wasn't away from her for more than a few minutes, and still right there beside her. I was on such a high coming home! I was also so astonished at how grateful the staff was to have me there. I left with big smiles and many thanks for my help, but as Amelia says "it was my pleasure!" and it was. </p>
<p>Mirei arrived just fifteen minutes after I stepped in the door, smiling too, but tired. She had a big bowl of oatmeal with Akane's homemade applesauce, and was tucked snugly into bed at 2:30, sleeping for an hour and a half. </p>
<p>The rest of the day flew by... while she napped, Gail and I worked on the family tree, adding some information Gail had discovered earlier today. What a nice little break this was in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>Mirei woke and I fed her and watched her as she puddled about the kitchen. She was a little off kilter today somehow, crying when I went into the laundry room and not responding in quite the same way to her usual walkabout with Grandpa. However, all in all, she was a happy girl, just not quite herself. </p>
<p>Instead of meeting Akane and Riku in the playground as planned, I decided to give Mirei some extra food before we headed to Hampshire Street at 5:20. Bryn stopped by for his mail as we were leaving, and Mirei and I had a very brisk stroller ride home; this gave her just enough time for some nursing with her mommy. </p>
<p>While Bryn drove Akane to class, I sat with the children while they ate the dinner that Akane had prepared... pasta with tomato sauce for them both, and with added veggies for Riku on the side. They both ate every bite of it, and of course Mirei still got topped up twice more before bedtime. </p>
<p>Once Bryn was home, we bathed the children; Bryn washed Riku's hair first and then Mirei joined him in the tub. She got all excited when I told her "splash, splash, splash" as I always did for Riku at that stage, and just like him she started smacking her hand up and down, letting me know she "got" it. </p>
<p>What an adorable twosome they are in the tub together! Riku is so careful not to splash his sister, and was sweetly advising her not to worry when I was washing her hair, that Nana would be careful and she would be okay. He made sure she had lots of toys, and chatted to her as though expecting an answer. She loves him so much, and leans forward to give him a nuzzle oh so often. She might have the best big brother in the known universe. Lucky girl, that Mirei. Of course I took photos. </p>
<p>We got them into pj's, with Riku asleep at 7:35, and Mirei tucked in at 8:45. She got to play in the living room between her two extra meals. She had joined Grandpa, her dad, and me for the second meal, eating as many pinto beans as she could talk Doug and Bryn out of, and settling for my black beans when their supply ran short. </p>
<p>Note from Bryn the other day: Bryn says: "Mirei continues to impress us with her food choices. <br />
pickled ginger slices, Japanese pickles, black beans with hot salsa not entirely wiped off. Riku asleep. Mirei fed and happy."</p>
<p>After Bryn picked Akane up at 9 o'clock, we went home for Doug to finish his packing for the too early trip to Chicago tomorrow morning and after checking email we went off to bed, turning out the light at 10:30. It was a busy productive day and I even annotated some photos... at last. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/02/end_of_the_week_already_1.html">End of the Week... Already!</a></h2>
								<p>The week flew by; Monday seems like yesterday and it's here already again tomorrow. I need a day with more hours to get even half the things done that I want to get done. Today disappeared too, and the hours are gone. It's bedtime.</p>
<p>Doug and I both slept until 8 o'clock, very unusual for both of us. I had my shower and dressed immediately, expecting that Mirei would be here with Bryn at any moment. He was off to the office to do some contractual work, and so I had volunteered to have either Riku or Mirei for the morning. They arrived at 8:30. Mirei has a new cold, poor babe, and her nose was running the entire visit. She had half the normal amount of oatmeal this morning, but it gave her enough energy to empty out the one kitchen drawer of elastics and twist-ties, another of cookie cutters, and two cupboards of plastic bags and dry foods. It is funny to see as it really looks as though they are tasks she has undertaken... as soon as one is done to her satisfaction, on she moves to the next. </p>
<p>I expected that she would have an extra long nap, and had barely started reading the morning paper, when she woke after just forty minutes. Her cold obviously had stopped her from breathing well, and she woke unhappy and needy, but would not go back down. I held her for a few minutes, hoping she would settle, but she cried hard until I whispered, asking her if she would like some water. She instantly stopped and looked up at me, obviously completely understanding that it meant leaving the room. So I dressed her, while she remained quiet, but was not happy when I tried to put her down for even a minute. Doug walked her around for a few minutes, her second walkabout of the short morning, and I prepared my breakfast, which I ate while feeding her a little fruit and vanilla soymilk, which she clearly enjoys, always signing for "more". </p>
<p>She needed more sleep, and as I was not convinced she was going to be happy going back to bed, a stroller ride was called for; I quickly made up a banana bread, while she emptied out some cupboards for the second time today, and we were off to meet Akane and Riku at the playground. We met them at 23rd and Folsom, with Riku on his tricycle, wearing his new helmet, looking oh-so-cute. That playground was closed, no doubt due to the heavy rains that had soaked the playing field there, so off we traveled to  the mini playground on 24th. Mirei had not fallen asleep immediately as I had thought she would; since I had her sitting up more for comfort with her nose, she was able to see trees, dogs, people, and birds, so it took her longer than usual. However, she had a good hour in before Doug picked me up for a double feature, starting at 2:20. </p>
<p>When we first met, I had said to Riku that I had missed him; I didn't see him yesterday and his answer was that he didn't miss me 'cause he saw me all the time. True. He also told me he had made me "something beautiful 'cause you like beautiful things." Also true. </p>
<p>I dashed off to buy an egg salad sandwich to eat in the theatre, and there I sat for four hours while we watched a Chinese movie ("Curse of the Golden Flower") starring Gong Li, beautifully done, a visual treat, and up for a costume design Academy Award this year, as well as "Little Children", with Kate Winslet nominated as best actress, as well two other nominations for the film. It was a movie I wasn't even tempted to sleep through, a tense fast-paced story. </p>
<p>Home for a quick dinner, finally got to read yesterday and today's papers, had my tea, cleared up the kitchen, watched a rented short HBO TV show "The Wire" with Doug, and that was my day... here and gone! </p>
<p>Bryn popped in to say hello and goodnight after a ping pong session; they had a little visit with the Doering/Ellis family after I left Akane with the children in the park, and Bryn got to hold little Finn again. </p>
<p>Bed at 11:30 tonight, my earliest night this week, and without having done a thing on the family tree all day.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2007/02/happy_valentines_day.html">Happy Valentine's Day, and Congratulations to Bryn and Caillie!</a></h2>
								<p>It was a chocolate day for sure around here, with a box of four Joseph Schmidt chocolates on my computer from Doug, a box of creamy tiny Joseph Schmidt truffles from Amelia, and yet a third box of wee Swiss truffles chocolates from Akane and Bryn, when they returned from their dinner out. Yum!</p>
<p>And today was also the day Riku was to have his root canal done; I didn't sleep well anticipating the pain he might be in, and was glad Doug agreed to go with us to the appointment, just in case he needed me in the back seat with him on the way home. However, it was needless worry, since he was congested enough and coughing enough, that the very kind Dr. Wong decided that he would hold off doing the root canal work, and just take the extra two X-rays Riku still needed. This worked well, as he had him hooked up to laughing gas, via mouth, and that certainly did relax him. He got used to breathing that in, while he watched a video, and the two X-rays turned out fine... no upset, and a good experience to leave the office with today. The two kind staff members, Dr. Wong, and I all cheered when they were done, so the next trip won't be so filled with anxiety for Riku. He was worried about having those pictures done.</p>
<p>He and Grandpa did some chasing/running to the bakery to buy a cookie each, and Riku fell asleep fairly quickly in the car, holding my hand. He dozed for about a half hour and then we came in to the house to eat. It was lovely having him here during an entire afternoon with me. We watched some new Caillou episodes, made swords with our legs and "battled", and had a picnic on our bed upstairs, just for a treat.</p>
<p>Of course we needed some fresh air and exercise, and I didn't want him running around with his cough, so we cleaned the yard. It was great fun; we both swept, Riku climbed up on the top level and pulled weeds and threw down big branches onto the pile we had made a week or more ago, and I put about half of the leaves, branches, etc. into the composting container for recycling. There is enough there for a second container for next week. Riku came in with rosy cheeks, wanting some hot chocolate and then dinner; he's a hungry boy.</p>
<p>I took advantage of the moment of time on my own to call the Toronto children; I spoke with them all but Bryn, who was at his swimming lesson. It was too bad I missed him, as Kelly had told me earlier that both he and Caillie had passed their first piano examination! What exciting news this was, as I hadn't known they had taken it. I learned that Bryant is taking a mixed class of guitar and piano, that  Myk' had been to a Valentine dance after school, which was lots of fun, and that a boy in Caillie's class has a crush on her and gave her a "bear love" card while all the other children received frogs with "ribbit"  on them and one other equally non-romantic. Caillie was a little embarrassed by the card but I'm sure very pleased as well.</p>
<p>Riku did some drawing while I made a chunky pasta sauce for dinner, along with steamed carrots and broccoli. Bryn and Akane arrived with Mirei at 5:15 and left for their Chinese dinner in a new spot fifteen minutes later. Bryn's ping pong teacher was going to be there too, and Bryn was looking forward to introducing her to Akane.</p>
<p>Mirei sat happily at the table with us, munching on broccoli and the bow pasta Riku had chosen. She was, as always, being a good little eater, but kept pointing at the bookshelves. Riku was so sweet, telling me that she had finished with one thing and wanted something else. Then, one minute later, he would say "Oh Nana, Mirei wants the bird now. She is tired of that chicken."</p>
<p>Mirei astounds us all with all the ways she can communicate... new words, old concepts, all with those astounding expressive eyebrows of hers, the flirtatious look, and the signing she has learned. When I asked if she wanted a bath, she made "splashing" motions, with a big smile that said "YES!". The clock chimes and Mirei rocks from side to side, with her index finger in the air keeping pace. Bryn likes to ask her if he should drop something on the floor, just to see her shake her head seriously at him, with those eyebrows raised, letting him know that is not a good idea. She flutters her little hands up and down above her waist to let me know her slippers have butterflies on them, as does the wall hanging from Auntie Sandy... a gift to Auntie Kelly when she was a baby. When the trees are blowing, Mirei's hands go above her head and drift side to side, along with a little whooshing sound, to let us know she noticed. We say "hat" and her hands go on her head, and asked if it is sleepy time, she puts her index finger to her lips to say "shhhh". This is my favourite of all. She will often do it on her own too. Last week I taught her to pretend she was using a straw, with her fingers joined together at her mouth, to let me know she was thirsty; it just amazes me to see how quickly she picks these things up. Last week we saw a bee in the back yard and now she moves her fingers up and down very quickly... like a fast "butterfly" motion to let me know what we saw. It's such fun for us and obviously for her too.</p>
<p>Bath time with the two children in the tub was just such fun. Riku went in first, so I could take some photos of Mirei standing beside the tub, and we both laughed to see that little leg of hers trying hard to get in there with him. Mirei is very comfortable in the water, swirling around to chase the bubbles I blew for her for the first time. However, she doesn't like to be tipped down to have her hair washed and once more Riku comes to her rescue telling her I will be very careful and not get water in her eyes.</p>
<p>Of course the favourite part of the tub for Riku is being wrapped in a big towel, warm from the dryer. I took Mirei out first and she obviously likes it too; we have a nice cuddle before laying flat to have a little massage with body lotion, and Mirei looked adorable in her brother's pale green sleepers from Japan.</p>
<p>Riku always says, without fail, each time I lift him out of the tub and have him snuggled in my arms in the towel, "This is our favourite part."... and it is indeed. He had his glow-in-the-dark bug PJs on tonight and looked ever so young. Doug kept an eye on Mirei, who kept busy pulling apart the dry goods cupboard and the elastic/twist tie drawers, while I read to Riku.</p>
<p>He was asleep at 7:40, and when I walked out of the room, Bryn was holding his newly bathed girl in his arms. He always loves the way her skin feels after a tub and she adores her daddy anytime at all!</p>
<p>They left me with a bowl of my favourite braised bean curd and big black mushrooms for lunch tomorrow. I got busy cleaning up my very messy kitchen, cleared away some paper work, sat and read the paper in the living room with my hot tea, and wrote a couple of short emails before heading to bed at 11:30. I am so far behind in them that I feel guilty every time I look at my in-box.</p>
<p>It was a very busy day and stressful as I had worried about this appointment for Riku last night, not sleeping well in the process. Tonight will be much better for certain!</p>
