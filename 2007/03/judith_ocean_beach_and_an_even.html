								<h2>Judith, Ocean Beach, and an Evening in Larkspur</h2>
								<p>As planned last night, I picked up Judith at her hotel in Millbrae at 10:30 A.M. It's another gorgeous day for her visit here, which was wonderful. One rainy day at the beginning of her week in San Francisco was enough! We drove to San Mateo to have lunch at "Amici's"; Judith rarely has pizza and enjoys it, so we happily shared a small pizza with mushrooms, green pepper, grilled onions, and black olives. We took time to wander into a popular Japanese dollar-type store, although with many higher priced items as well. I bought a new broom for the children for a dollar, and Judith found two pottery serving dishes she liked so much for $10 each; she would have bought more, but her carryon suitcase wouldn't hold more extras than this. </p>
<p>From there we drove to Riku's school and picked him up at 2:15, later than we had hoped. He was very happy to find that we were off to Ocean Beach with him, but we had less than an hour there. I set up the camera to get some shots of the three of us, and took some of Judith and Riku fetching a pail of water at the water's edge. The waves were quite high today, but it was just perfect sitting back further on the beach, digging a big hole, Riku's favourite thing to do right now. Judith loves the beach too; it's how we spent so much of our time together when we were young moms.. and now we're young grandmoms. Riku was so sweet with Judith, inviting her to dig with him and commenting on how well she was doing; he has another fan for certain. </p>
<p>We had to dash off long before we were ready, to get Judith back to her hotel in time to meet David. We took a new way to the airport, with Judith navigating, so she was delighted to have seen not only the Sunset district on the way in, but the coastal highway on the way back. Riku napped for about twenty minutes but woke up once I had dropped Judith off. Heaven knows when we will see each other again; it has been three years since our last visit. Emails and online photos, as well as the occasional phone calls, keep us connected though. </p>
<p>Riku wanted to come back home with me, but when I told him his sister would be so excited to see him after a long day without him... at which point I babbled baby talk at him, waving my arms around in excitement... he laughed so hard, over and over, insisting I tell him again what she would do when she saw him, that he happily agreed to go right home. He would only have had fifteen minutes here anyway. I had made plans with Akane to have him home by 5 o'clock, which is exactly when she and a sleeping Mirei showed up from a short stroller ride, and Bryn too, home from work for the weekend. Riku and I spent those ten minutes looking at his book about jelly fish, tucked away out of sight for a couple of months and now happily rediscovered. </p>
<p>I dashed home to check my email and then heading out the door immediately with Doug for Larkspur, where we had dinner and watched a concert at a lovely little dinner theatre. We had a small table for two right in front of the stage, and enjoyed delicious wild salmon burgers with a green salad, and tea for me, before the show. The show consisted of three women: a singer/songwriter from Australia, now living in Bolinas, called Audrey Auld Mezera, a wonderfully talented guitarist (Nina Gerber) whom we saw many many years ago playing with Kate Wolfe at Mariposa and other folk festivals, and a gal (Pam Delgado) we had seen for the first time a few weeks ago at the "West Coast Live" radio show, part of a band called "Blame Sally". They were all very talented and obviously enjoying their time together on stage. The Australian gal sang a song she had written called "I Love You Like the Earth", written for her child, and we bought the DVD so that perhaps I can learn some of the verses to sing to my grandchildren.</p>
<p>Home to read the new book I started just last night, recommended by Judith, and a real page turner! Lights out late!</p>
