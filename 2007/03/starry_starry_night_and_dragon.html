								<h2>Starry, Starry Night... and Dragons Too!</h2>
								<p>It was a gorgeous spring-like day today, with warm temps and clear blue skies. I hate to admit that we spent the entire day inside, but we did. Somehow the hours just flew by, and the day was gone! </p>
<p>Akane, Bryn, and Riku went off to a multi-family yard sale, looking for Japanese books for Riku, so Miss Mirei was here for play time and nap time with me for a few hours. Doug went off to his first T'ai Chi class in two plus weeks, so he was gone when she arrived. Of course she had seen him on Thursday night briefly and on Friday afternoon, so she was quite perplexed that he wasn't sitting in his chair in front of the computer when she came in. She even peered into the kitchen, hoping that he would be at the table, but no such luck, and up went her hands and eyebrows... they say it all... "Where in the world can he be now? "</p>
<p>And after a big breakfast she was already down for her nap when he came in, so it was after her two hour sleep that she finally got to see him. I fed her a bit of lunch, and just in time as her dad came by shortly after she had eaten. Riku and Akane were napping in the car, though, so he had time to join us upstairs. I had a show on amazing children taped that I wanted him to see and he got more than halfway through it before Akane called. I kept Mirei entertained with the big Lego blocks she is just learning to pull apart. She struggles first, grunting and groaning with effort, before finally passing it over for a little help from Nana. </p>
<p>I forgot to mention yesterday that when we were upstairs playing in our room the evening before, she had leaned over to kiss a picture on the cover of a book of a family, many many times. It was adorable. She also kissed "the baby" in the fireplace mirror and likes to put her mouth against my cheek for a big smackaroo too! It's adorable. </p>
<p>Mirei has gotten used to waving goodbye from the window,  every time someone leaves the house,as it's something we do from our house and theirs as well. We were always lucky enough to live in a spot that allowed us to do this from the time Kelly was a baby and the tradition has continued. </p>
<p>As busy as Riku is at something he will go dashing to the window, encouraging everyone else to "come, quick, they're leaving!" so they don't miss out. Bryn is so good with Mirei, and instead of just popping her into her car seat, will often show her something first... the dog two doors over that Mirei hopes to see in the window, a plane, some birds, a local cat... whatever he thinks she might be interested in... and if it takes too long Riku will say "Go! Go!", but as anxious as he is to get back to his game, cars, drawing, he will not budge until we have waved until the car is out of sight. I love to think this is something the children will remember all of their days. </p>
<p>Gail and I had some time with our family tree after Mirei and Bryn left, and caught up on some new facts and dates. That time always flies by as well, and before we knew it it was time to break for dinner. The doorbell rang and it was Mirei with her mom! I had totally forgotten that we were having Mirei here tonight while her brother and parents went to the Chinese New Year's parade in Chinatown. It was 5:30, and Mirei was hungry too, so I quickly made a stir fry with rice for us, and Mirei had rice with a mixed vegetable dinner from a jar and a nice bowl of strained pears for dessert. She will not eat fresh pairs and rarely will eat a piece of banana, but mash the bananas or give her strained pears and she is perfectly happy to indulge. I think it's a texture thing... </p>
<p>After dinner was "splashy bath" time... one of Mirei's favourite pastimes. She was sitting at the table, just getting washed up, when I asked if she would like one, and she immediately gets into her "let's get at it!" mode. Straining in her seat to get up and out, and then beetling off to the bathroom at top speed. By the time I was in, she had one of her little legs hoisted up over the side of the tub, really trying hard to get in, clothes and all. Of course her legs are much too short to actually get in, but that doesn't stop her from trying really hard anyway! </p>
<p>I took lots of photos of her, and gave her hair a little curl at the top when it was wet. How she loves to splash about, chasing the tub toys about, and trying hard to release the plunger to let the water out. Doug came in long enough to see her thoroughly enjoying the bubbles I was blowing at her. She goes right at them, to break them and to inspect them when they land on her arms. No matter how long I have her in the water, she cries a little when I take her out. However, she also loves having her body lotion rubbed on her, and giggles when I do her feet and toes. When I brought her out in an old pair of Riku's pale green one-piece sleepers, Doug commented on how cute she looked... and she sure did. </p>
<p>She and I sat on the sofa reading books, turning the pages over and over on her favourite ones, which include "Pat the Bunny" and a peek-a-boo book with small children and their body parts... hands, feet, heads, etc. ... which she loves to lift-the-flap to see for herself. </p>
<p>I wanted to "top her up" before her bedtime, so we sat at the table with more books, one with a feather to blow, while she ate tiny bites of a whole wheat cinnamon raisin bagel. I gave her a toasted and buttered quarter, ate the other half of it, and then had to go and toast another since she was more than ready for that too. </p>
<p>Mirei was a tired girl, I thought Bryn would be here soon for her, so into her sleeper blanket she went, and since it was such a mild night, we went outside to sit on the front steps to wait for him. What a lovely time we had. Buses were going by, and Mirei was just delighted when I sang the "Wheels on the Bus" song to her each time we saw one. How she loved my going "beep beep beep" and "swish swish swish" using her own hand for the gestures! We saw the flashing red lights from Sutro Tower, heard two planes and saw their brief tail lights, and heard a dog barking. There was lots to see and talk about, but the best part of the whole evening was seeing how quickly Mirei learned a new word and could "tell" it to me using a sign. She spotted a big bright star and pointed it out to me. I said the word and instantly made up a sign for it, by opening and closing my hand quickly and saying "star". Another bus went by, she spotted a cat walking across the road, and then pointed to the star, opening and closing her hand to let me know she knew it! This has happened twice this week and it just astounds me; she in not only eager to learn a new word but quick to pick up on it too. What a girl! </p>
<p>Riku enjoyed the Chinese parade, complete with loud drumming and lots of very large dragons; it was as crowded as it always is for that celebration, but he was happily perched on his Dad's shoulders just five people back from the curb, so had a good view after all. They finished off their day with Chinese food and then home for tuck-in time. Tonight is Riku's second night sleeping through on his own; he awoke three times last night, crying out, but soon settled and went back to sleep without a parent. </p>
<p>Mirei's little head was bobbing in tiredness a bit as we waited; she hadn't had an afternoon nap, only the late morning one, and once it a while she would stand up and nestle against my shoulder. Bryn said she was asleep the instant the car moved and was sound asleep by the time they reached home three minutes later... tucked into her crib within five minutes of leaving here. What a busy day for this busy little one. </p>
<p>Gail and I had some family tree time, and then both went off to bed to read. Lights out here at 11:25.</p>
