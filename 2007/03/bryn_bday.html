								<h2>Bryn's 39!!!!</h2>
								<p>Bryn's birth day in Ottawa, all those years ago, couldn't have been more different weather-wise then the way we celebrated it today. The night he was born it was very cold, with severe icy conditions. Gram had walked me out to a cab at midnight, and then I worried about her all the way to the hospital, concerned about her falling. She was sixty-eight at the time, almost sixty-nine, and although in wonderful health, she didn't like the ice any more than I did, and likely was tensed up all the way back to the house!</p>
<p>A dear friend, David, sent through a medley of "Happy Birthday" renditions, which played on the computer; we had those running all through Bryn's party later in the day. There was also a piece for us, for an early anniversary gift... the anniversary waltz, which is just lovely. These are keepers as I will be able to send them on to others too! </p>
<p>We had a high of 26C today! The sun was shining all day, the sky was blue, and we had good reason to celebrate. Which we did, starting with an invitation for breakfast at Jim's, the local greasy spoon in the Mission, one of Bryn's favourite haunts when he's in the mood for eggs and high-gloss hash browns. We all enjoyed it. Riku ate so many of my potatoes that I ordered an extra side of them but am happy to report that we left over half of them there. MIrei helped by wiping the table with not just one, but two napkins, looking very serious about her clean-up duties. What a funny little girl she is. </p>
<p>Bryn had spotted a new place in the Mission featuring home made pies, aptly named "Mission Pies". Bryn thoroughly enjoyed his slice of banana cream, the one his Grandpa Dyment would have ordered for certain. Akane had a walnut pie, and Doug a raspberry pear, but the winner seemed to be the banana cream. Mirei happily crawled and table walked around while Riku and I read two stories. No pie for me... I would have eaten those potatoes if I had been hungry enough. I am a potato gal, more than a pie gal. </p>
<p>Mirei came home with us, for her nap, but first of course it was porridge time for her, with the usual bananas, blueberries, and flax seed added in. She eats the biggest servings of it, all the time pointing to things to play with while she eats. Today I turned her chair around, so that she could see the trees, and the flowers in the garden. The blue jay came by, just in time for Mirei's entertainment. She napped for an hour and a half, which seems to be the standard right now. How she loves to stand up on the bed, and then throw herself down into the pillows; such a feisty little girl! </p>
<p>The few hours up to party time, at 3 P.M., flew by of course. I made Bryn a batch of his favourite granola, tried a new recipe for guacamole, which everyone liked a lot, then a caprese salad, cut up a sweet and juicy pineapple, to go with a big basket of lovely strawberries, which Riku parked himself in front of as soon as they were put on the table. Doug was busy wrapping gifts and making up gift certificates, as well as helping put out food, blowing up lots of balloons, and setting the plants I bought on the front steps. The only thing I didn't get done today was to plant them in the pots on the landing at the front door. </p>
<p>Campbell, a friend of Bryn's from Xoom, arrived first, and helped snip basil over the caprese salad, and then Bryn and family showed up. Riku was tired and hot, but soon got busy playing with Campbell and showing her around. Amelia showed up not too much later, which was great, as the two of them went off to play together... upstairs in the bedroom with the cars, out in the yard with the brooms, sweeping away, and having a little picnic too, while Mirei tried her hardest to sneak outside as well while the back door was open and freedom available! </p>
<p>Mirei loves a party and wandered about being her sweet and cheerful self. The sweetest thing of all was seeing her lean over to give Finn a kiss, all on her own, and just automatically. Apparently it happened twice with someone noticing and she may have snuck in a few extra kisses too. She reminded me so much of Amelia when she was this age, who was such a kisseroo. I have so many photos of that little girl with her lips stuck way out for a kiss, and now here comes another one! How sweet it is... </p>
<p>There were lots of nibbles to eat, everyone moved from one room to another... the living room, the dining room or kitchen, and in Susan's case also the bedroom, to nurse Finn and try to settle him down. I got to hold him a few times, and Doug had him out in the garden too, to settle him and get him to sleep. Susan did manage to get him to nap for quite a long while, as we were all settled in the dining room munching away, but he woke in time to see Bryn open his gifts. Of course Amelia and Riku were as thrilled as always with the singing of "Happy Birthday" and watching the candles get blown out... all 39 of them. </p>
<p>We said our goodbyes to sleepy children by 6:30, all heading home for baths and beds. Doug was busy cleaning up dishes and the table when I came back in and the two of us had the kitchen and dining room in perfect shape within a half hour. I had a non-painful migraine headache all day, with little spots and flashes dancing around the peripheral edges of my eyes, and it had left me feeling a bit disoriented. Perfect timing to just go upstairs with a hot cup of tea, and watch a movie, but I wasn't terribly keen on it, and managed to drift off instead, no doubt doing my eyes a favour anyway. </p>
<p>Chatted with Kelly on Skype IM for a long while, catching up with her for the first time in a while. Caillie had called through to wish Uncle Bryn a happy birthday just as he was cutting the cheesecake, and we could hear her singing away to him. This is the first March break that she and Brynnie have not been here with us, with the exception of the one year they all went to Florida. What amazing weather they would have had for all the trips we usually do... the tide pools, Ocean Beach, Santa Cruz.. They would have loved it as always, and I miss having them here. </p>
<p>Bedtime before midnight, made easier since the clocks were moved forward last night. It is still only 10 P.M. body time, but feels like the 11 o'clock the clock is saying it is! </p>
