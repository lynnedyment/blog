								<h2>Slowwwww Sunday</h2>
								<p>Today was very quiet around here with nary a child in sight. It passed by very slowly as a result; funny how that happens! Doug and I had poached eggs on toast for breakfast, a rare treat, since Doug usually eats much earlier than I do and has a yogurt, some toast, and juice. However, he woke up at 5 A.M. today(!), sat at the computer and was ready to eat when I came down at 8 o'clock. </p>
<p>I had a quiet morning with the Sunday paper, wrote a few emails, had a long leisurely shower, and by 10:30 was ready for some kiddie time; I didn't have long before we had to leave for our afternoon movies, so I suggested a trike ride for Riku around the block, but was turned down. He told me he was watching "Totoro", and was obviously engrossed in it, as he filled me in on the action and told me he wanted to see it, not go for a ride. Boo hoo. Mirei was in her crib, having "quiet time" her mom told me, with the idea that she might drift off to sleep. </p>
<p>Doug and I went off to see two movies up for lead actors in the Academy Awards. Of course they took place last week, and we knew who the winner was, but that didn't stop our enjoyment of the wonderful acting for both... Forrest Whittaker in "The Last King of Scotland", and Peter O'Toole in "Venus." I was happy to see Forrest win as it was obviously much more of a challenge for him to play Idi Amin, than for Peter O'Toole to play a dirty old man lusting after a teenager. All of the acting in both films was just terrific and I enjoyed them both. </p>
<p>We had thoughts about going to the North Bay for a book reading, but it seemed a shame to have to put in two and a half hours, especially since we couldn't even fill it with an early dinner. Two tubs of popcorn with engevita yeast took care of our calories for the day! </p>
<p>Home for a fruit plate, and after a couple of hours of emailing and some reading for me with my tea, we watched the taped Academy Award show. It was long, even with the commercials cut out, and it was after 11 P.M. when we finished. Bed time followed almost immediately... </p>
