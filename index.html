								<p>Those were the first words Riku spoke as he got off the bus that brought him back from his first swim class here in Kyoto. Swimming, or rather not swimming, has been a worry for Riku for a long time. When he first moved here in the spring of 2009 and found out he was going to have to swim at school, he fretted about it, and I know it has been in the back of his mind ever since. He did not enjoy the lessons he had at school, that year or this year.</p>
<p>He took private lessons in San Francisco that first summer, and was doing very well at overcoming his fear of putting his face in the water (and of being convinced that he just couldn't do it.). His cousin Bryn was like this as well, even after a number of years of lessons. Both of them didn't/don't want to attempt to do some things if they are not positive they will succeed. They somehow feel that it came easily to everyone but them.  </p>
<p>Those lessons ended with Riku being able to swim a bit, making him feel much better about himself. However, his last lesson was taken with a gal who broke his trust in her, promising she would not let go of him in the middle of the pool and then doing so. Arggggh! </p>
<p>Once more he was dreading the classes at his school, even months before they were going to happen. Soooooo ... </p>
<p>... today was the big day! His parents signed him up for lessons with a proper swimming school, so he would be in with children at his level ... not able to swim. Makes sense, as this puts him on an even keel, something that is so important to him. </p>
<p>He had brought up the upcoming lessons a number of times this past week or so, didn't seem terribly worried, but nonetheless they were obviously on his mind. We have chatted about them briefly over the week on the way to school. </p>
<p>This morning he told me he was a "still a little worried ". I reassured him that he would be in with other children who could not swim yet, that I was a teenager before I learned to swim, that even champion swimmers, such as his cousin, didn't learn to swim right away.</p>
<p>As we walked to the bus stop to meet the bus that would take him off for this big step, I told Riku that he should not worry about swimming, but just have fun in the water and to relax and enjoy it. </p>
<p>And then I had to wait two hours before walking back to the bus stop to get him... </p>
<p>What a big smile I saw when he stepped off that bus. He came out with that "You were right!" ... and all the way home I heard every detail of the session. </p>
<p>The male teacher is very nice, there are four children in his class, they had a warm shower first, then stepped into water that was at their knees, then up to their middles, and then up to their necks.They could hold on to the sides and stand on their tiptoes.</p>
<p>Early on, the teacher said he was going to pour water over their heads to get them used to water on their faces. Riku told me he kept his eyes closed the first time, forgetting that he had goggles on, but then he opened them and it was fun to see the water coming down over them. </p>
<p>They went under water at different levels with objects varying in size, and Riku was so proud that he put not just his face in the water, but even bent way down and  picked a marble up off the floor of the pool! </p>
<p>The only part Riku didn't like was when he opened his mouth a bit under the water and swallowed, but he is sure he won't do that again. </p>
<p>He is looking forward to next Saturday and I am one very happy Nana! He liked it, he really liked it! </p>
<p>p.s. His teacher called Akane in the evening to say that Riku had done very well, had had a great time, and wondered what Riku's reaction had been.  </p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/12/in_one_of_my_rooms_in_heaven.html">"In One of My Rooms in Heaven ..."</a></h2>
								<p>This phrase begins one of Riku and Mirei's favourite things to do right now. I'm not sure how it got started, but we first played it during the summer in San Francisco. We each take turns pretending we have a <strong>huge</strong> house in heaven (Mirei's is actually a castle), and we can choose whatever we like to fill one of them. </p>
<p>Riku's house (he calls it "our house" as we live together, along with lots of family members too) is four stories high. Good thing with all those people in it! Some samples from Riku: a game room filled with video games, a huge kitchen that always has all his favourite foods at the ready, a room with every drink you could ever want to have, mostly hot chocolate with marshmallows, and lots of juice, and tea for the grown-ups too. There will be a movie-watching room, with every movie one would ever want to see, and snacks at the back too, as much popcorn as we like. There will be a game room as well, with Lego, puzzles, and building toys. The list goes on and on ... </p>
<p>Mirei's rooms are very different; they contain one just for ribbons and bows for all the presents there, for her and for her friends too. They are mostly pink and purple bows and ribbons, but no yellow. Mirei is not a fan of yellow. There is a room filled with dolls, and doll clothes, and strollers, and cribs, and lots of pretend animals too. Mirei hasn't mentioned food or drinks yet, but I'm sure that will come in time. Mirei would like a big kitchen where she can make real pizza and snacks, just like the kitchen at the San Jose Discovery Museum but with real food and real ovens. </p>
<p>Mirei likes to talk about her plans on the bus, but occasionally when we are sitting at the table too. Then she and Riku and I take turns stating our wishes. Riku's descriptions are always very elaborate, though, and Mirei often gets impatient waiting for her turn to come around again. </p>
<p>Riku and I have a lot of time alone, so his plans are not just for the house, but for the grounds and surrounding area as well. I will have him draw a picture of it soon, before it gets busy and he forgets the details. </p>
<p>We will live in the country; he likes to live in this area he is in now, so there will be fields with vegetables and fruit, mountains behind the house, with a big city hidden behind them. There will be a river and a lake too, so we can "relax" by the water when it is hot, but it will never be too hot, because it is heaven. </p>
<p>Animals, even wild animals, will wander about, but no one will ever get hurt by one, and they won't hurt each other either. There will be cats and dogs too, with no claws or sharp teeth, so that Mirei is not afraid of them. I will not be allergic to cats. </p>
<p>There is so much more to tell ... we will have wings, of course, so that we can fly wherever we like and never get tired. </p>
<p>There will be no money in heaven except for smokers who will pay a fine if they smoke, but after twenty times they will go in between heaven and hell. (Riku doesn't want smoke to make heaven not smell good or make the air dirty.)</p>
<p>There are no bad guys or good guys; everyone is nice because that is why they are in heaven. Oh, and beautiful music always playing, but softly, so it doesn't bother anyone. Grandpa will have a big library with music and some tools too. </p>
<p>One of Riku's first suggestions was that in heaven we will see everyone we always loved. What a guy! </p>
<p>I shall make a list of more rooms as I think about them. It has been such fun having this continue on when we have those quiet moments to really think about what would make us happiest.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2010/12/bbxxxthe_best_nana.html">The Best Nana</a></h2>
								<p>Mirei went off to a birthday party today, from 2â€“5, at a classmate's home. Akane had called near the end of that time, saying that they would be home soon but she had no plans for dinner. Riku was watching the end of a movie he had started in the morning, so I got busy making the creamy stove-top mac' and cheese both children enjoy so much, along with some veggies on the side. </p>
<p>Riku was hungry, so he and I had our dinners over with by the time Mirei and her mom arrived home, just after 6 o'clock. </p>
<p>I sat with Mirei while she ate her dinner, and she was such a cuddly girl. She would lean over and give me a big hug, and then a kiss, and take another bite. At one point, after another big hug, she said to me "Nana, you are my best Nana. I love you. I like how you love me."  The feeling is certainly mutual!</p>
