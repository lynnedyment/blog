								<h2>A Taste of Italy!</h2>
								<p>Riku awoke at 6 a.m. today, after going to sleep at 8 p.m. Not bad, but better still was that 7:30 awakening last week! I awoke when he did, but decided to give him some time with his mom while I read and thought about going back to sleep. I gave up at 6:45 and joined them in the dining room. Riku was already busy playing; Akane had made him a boiled egg, some tomato, and toast and he had eaten only half the egg. I'm not surprised; that tummy must still have been pretty darned full after last night! </p>
<p>The plan today was to have lunch with Ayako, and go on to a new museum in Osaka, I believe. I played "kitchen" with Riku after checking my emails, and learning that Don has a job which begins on Tuesday; it's in the investment field, which skills he has picked up on his own over the years. What a good day for him! I know he will enjoy being back out in the work force again, outside the home for a nice change of pace. </p>
<p>Akane sat and played with Riku while I showered, as I know Riku will need his morning nap if we are going to be out for most of the day. At 8:45 a.m. we were in the park, having first stopped to look at a huge "cherry picker" outside the building cleaning windows. I bought Riku a cherry picker as part of his mini vehicles, and he knew they were for fixing wires and cutting trees. I hadn't thought about window cleaning! Later in the day we saw another one with the fellow working on wires overhead so that was perfect timing... two examples in one day. </p>
<p>Riku was very active and busy at the park. There was a group of seniors playing croquet again; I think they are a fairly regular early morning group. Of eight people, only one was a woman, and she was over eighty by the looks of her, very bent over and fragile looking, but also very competent at the game! Riku watched for a bit, but then decided today was the day he was going to go down the slide many many times. I think I mentioned that he had stopped sliding down after my first day or two here, and then went down once last week. Well, he more than made up for it today; down he would go, run around to the ladder, climb up, go immediately down and on and on it went. He wanted me to go down too; I told him to catch me at the bottom, and I wish I could have taken a photo of that little boy at the bottom of the slide holding open his arms! </p>
<p>On one of the last trips down Riku spotted an ant; he does chat to little creatures, and was asking if it wanted to go down the slide. I told him I thought the ant would be frightened, and he bent over and asked "Are you frightened?" He watched it wander around on the little stoop, and a couple of times it started to go down the side where I was watching from. Up it clambered again and Riku's nose was practically on top of it! I told Riku we would put him down in the sand so he could find some food and managed to flick it gently over the side. Riku slid down quickly to see it crawling along a leaf and so we spent a few more minutes watching this busy ant. </p>
<p>I put Riku in the stroller at 9:45, at which point he always, without fail, wants a "snack?" Today it was a container with a few slices of his uneaten banana from breakfast, and four sliced strawberries, then his half slice of toast from breakfast, and a tiny cookie, and the last of the cheddar bunnies, and finally a good portion of dried apricots, cranberries, and dried blueberries. After a big drink of water, he was asleep very quickly... 10:15. It had been a bit cool when we set out, but I took Riku's cotton jacket off before he settled in; the sun was out and hot already! </p>
<p>I do try to find shady streets to walk on, as my arms and hands are getting too brown and I keep forgetting to put sunblock on before I leave the house. Today Riku should have had it on his arms and lower legs too; the house was coolish when we left, so I hadn't thought about it. </p>
<p>I walked all the way to a busy shopping area, as it is an interesting walk along small lanes and then has lots of busy stuff going on once I arrive there. Unfortunately today, I once again ran into the area just as a van with a very loud amplified message (perhaps an election vehicle) drove by; the voice is irritating to start with and the volume is just horrible. Riku was forty minutes into his nap and that was that! He was still tired and despite my getting away from the van as quickly as possible, and into a side street, it was too late; he was awake and obviously not rested. </p>
<p>We got home just after 11 a.m. and Akane told us Ayako would be picking us all up before noon. I automatically went to make Riku something to eat to take with us, but Akane said he would eat pasta and pizza and so I needn't  bother. Yes, we were going out for an Italian lunch; perfect! I was ready for it, after eating only two small pieces of toast this morning with peanut butter, and then a good long walk.</p>
<p>It was 1 p.m. before we were served, Riku immediately ate two small pieces of white bread with herbs, and a stickly sweet fried ball of dough (delicious though!) so he ate only three small bites of pizza and no pasta. This boy needs to eat when he is first hungry; next time we will take along a yogurt (he hadn't had any today) just to make certain there is good food in that tummy before the free appetizers arrive. </p>
<p>Akane had suggested a creamy tomato pasta with mushrooms to me, and it was so very good! We each ordered a different main dish and then shared a margherita pizza, Italian-style, with thin almost cracker-like dough and really tasty tomato sauce with fresh tomatoes and basil. Lunch dishes were served with a small green salad and tea. I enjoyed every bite of mine, as did Akane and Ayako. </p>
<p>We were in a mall with a really wonderfull store called "Moji"; we were at one a few days ago as well... very reasonably priced items, clothing, furniture, paper products, etc., and Akane wanted to stop in for a few things to take home. I bought a small plastic zipped container of thin markers to keep in the car at home for Riku when we go out for a meal, along with a medium sized pad of plain paper to keep with it. I also thought I could use it for the plane trip home, and perhaps with the children in the playground here too. I found a plastic-covered date book, with just the days of the week in it on one side, lined paper opposite and blank pages in the back. Perfect for logging in my doula weeks, as they are not marked with the months or days. </p>
<p>By this time it was evident that Riku needed sleep... soon! He was tearing around the store with Auntie Ayako trying to keep up with him; I thought it was time for me to just wander and let them have the time together. It was fun to hear her calling to him, and really moving with the stroller trying to find him! Just as she caught up with him, he would shriek and set off again. </p>
<p>The next part of the day was to have been the museum, but I personally did not want to even think about trying to keep him not only quiet but happy in that setting. He would have been fine if he could be walked first, as he would have slept through the exhibits, but there wasn't time for that. I suggested that Akane and Ayako go on their own, after dropping me off with Riku somewhere I could walk home from. </p>
<p>Hmm, an Italian lunch; seemed like an Italian dessert would be just the thing, and the ideal spot for me to walk home with Riku afterwards. Akane, Ayako, and Riku all seemed to think that was a good idea too! It was their first time there (the sisters, that is; Riku and I are regulars by now) and the gelato maker himself came out of the glass back room, right over to me, and said something to me in Japanese. He recognized me (Akane said it would be difficult for him not to have!) and wanted me to try his new chocolate gelato; he went behind the counter and gave me a nice big tasting spoon of it, and everyone else too. How could I not get it after that nice gesture? Riku had an all-strawberry one this time although felt quite free to dip into my cup of chocolate more than a few times! Akane had the strawberry as well (it tasted just like crushed strawberries bound with a little cream... soooo good!), and Ayako had a big cone with two flavours... mango and a very yellowy vanilla... French vanilla, no doubt. I had told Akane I really wanted to try the coconut and the custard before I leave... and perhaps I should try the caramel too. Akane kindly told the gal behind the counter about the coconut and custard (I hadn't told her of the caramel), and told her I was leaving soon. She said she was sure the owner would do them up for me, so I must stop in every day before I leave. It really is so very good! I am going to miss it for sure once my walks here are over. </p>
<p>Riku sits so nicely with his cup in hand eating happily away at his treat; he said a very enthusiastic "arigato!" when he left, and we set off for our walk, waving goodbye to his mommy and aunt. Fifteen minutes later he was sound asleep, feet up on the bar in front of him, looking very relaxed. He slept for almost two hours, while I walked and walked and walked some more, up and down every shady side street I could find, and trying very hard to avoid the motorscooter guy delivering papers by stopping his noisy machine every single house down the block! I would turn in another direction to avoid him and five minutes later there he was on that block! </p>
<p>I took Riku right upstairs for an early dinner (it was 5 p.m. by now), and promised him we would go to the playground as soon as he ate. I decided the fastest and healthiest meal for him would be oatmeal with a little four-grain cereal cooked in with it ; I also added those fresh strawberries he is so wild about, one dried apricot in tiny pieces, and four almonds chopped up very finely, as well as the wheat germ and flax seed that always goes into it. Once again I ended up with a huge bowl, put about 2/3 of it in his bowl, and it disappeared, along with the rest of it! I know adults who couldn't eat that much at one sitting! I didn't even offer anything more after that amazing feat. </p>
<p>We got his sand toys, left a note for Akane to join us if she liked, and were in the playground at 5:45. Except for a young couple sitting on a bench, no one was there but us. They left very soon after we arrived but waved and said goodbye to Riku first. I was so happy to see Yui come and play; she had her two-year-old brother with her, and made him bow his head and shoulders at us, by pushing on the top of his head. She was very motherly with him, putting him on the bouncing toys and then carefully lifting him off. Soon Aya joined us too, and they all sat playing in the sandbox. Aya ran upstairs and came running down with her paper and pen, and I too had my new pens and notebook with me. We wrote our names again, and when the older brother joined us, he too wrote his name in English, but with some diffiuculty. I wonder if only the younger children learn English as he seemed to struggle to remember how to do it. </p>
<p>Their dad was home tonight and just before 7 p.m. called them home; Riku and I left soon after that. I didn't expect him to eat much dinner, but knew he needed some veggies; I heated up some new grainy rice that Akane had frozen, added half the package to the leftover Chinese veggie dish from two days ago, and watched in amazement as Riku ate all but two bites of this generous portion of food!... eggplant, sweet potato, tofu, onions, green peppers, and the tomatoes left over from his breakfast. He didn't refuse dessest either... ate six little balls of sorbet Akane buys for him and maybe a quarter of a banana. </p>
<p>Akane arrived home just as he was finishing up his dinner. They had had trouble finding the museum, then couldn't find parking easily, so by the time they got there Ayako had decided to sit in the car and read while Akane dashed in for the thirty-five minutes they were still open. </p>
<p>Riku knows it's bathtime after dinner, so in he went, playing happily for just fifteen minutes tonight; he brushed his teeth (I told him about going to the dentist tomorrow... how he would sit in a big chair, and the dentist would look in his mouth and touch his teeth... Rike repeated at the end of it all... "it's okay" to reassure himself that it would indeed be okay.), got his own pyjama bottoms on and up, and told his mommy it was "bedtime Mommy!" Off he goes wth a kiss on each cheek for his Nana and a big squeeze. Akane said he took about fifteen to twenty minutes to fall asleep... 8:50 tonight... a little later than would be ideal. Akane is enjoying her long quiet evenings in front of the TV these days; I am on her computer of course, but she says she is enjoying it and, from the occasionaly bursts of laughter I hear, I have no reason to doubt her! </p>
<p>One sweet story to tell you tonight... while Riku was sitting in the rocking horse in the playground tonight, he noticed the clouds. I pointed out that there was a huge one, two very long ones, and lots of tiny ones. He pays such attention to this kind of thing... always looks up to see the moon, and has a big smile when he spots it.. Tonight he was looking thoughtful about the clouds and he said to me "Clouds in there.", and I asked, of course, "Clouds in where?". He answered "Clouds in book." Hmmm, so the next obvious question was "Which book?" He thought for a minute and said "Big cloud in Frog and Toad book.", and there is; we've discussed it several times. Frog and Toad are sitting on a rock and there is a big cloud behind them. How he loves being read to!</p>
<p>p.s. for those of you wondering... Riku agreed to sit on the toilet only twice today and not a thing happened! I think the thought of all of this leading to actually having a BM disappear in there was enough to slow down the enthusiasm of a few days ago. We shall just keep asking and not making any fuss about it; he will be ready at some point. </p>
<p>p.s. One last note: Riku now weighs 12.8 on the scale!!! </p>
<p>Night night... 10:20 and I'm off to read and sleep...</p>
