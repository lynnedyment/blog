								<h2>A Red-Banner Day!</h2>
								<p>I awoke this morning at 5:45 after hearing Riku, but it was after a wonderful seven hour sleep! Riku went back to bed for an hour but I didn't. It was a great chance to catch up on some emails, sorely neglected since working on my blog entries. </p>
<p>I promised Riku while he was eating his breakfast that we would go out for a walk; I knew he would need a nap, and have learned that the earlier the morning nap is, the better, so the afternoon nap isn't so late. Akane had prepared a cup of hot chocolate for me; I had some seeded bread, toasted, with peanut butter for my breakfast and we were out the door at 8:30 a.m. Riku told me "something in shoe" (which was sand, it turned out) but it gave me the perfect opportunity to put him in his stroller; he was asleep at 9 a.m. </p>
<p>I had quite the adventure as I walked for over two and a half hours! I walked to Diamond City (Akane was quite impressed when I told her this) and was doing well, until I headed back and decided to take a quiet laneway instead of staying on the main roads. The two towers that make up our "home base" are very visable for a huge distance, but it turns out not from some of the more crowded areas of the city. I walked down tiny laneways that had no exit, went through a complex that was surrounded by walls, but that looked promising from each end, and lost sight of the towers several times! However, it was fine; Riku napped for only forty minutes and was awakened by a very loud "talking" truck parked at a busy intersection. We had to wait there too long to avoid his hearing it, but he did doze, relax, and snack the rest of the journey. </p>
<p>Twice I stopped and asked "Sakai-chi?" and was told the right direction but that was still before the towers were always visible. What fun the directionally handicapped have! Finally, we were headed  in the right direction, with the towers where I couldn't miss them, and we arrived safe and sound, if with tired feet, at the park. </p>
<p>Riku was very happy to get out and run around, go up the hill collecting rocks (of course!), chatting at some length with a woman about her dog. At least that is what I assume they were talking about. It was all in Japanese and involved lots of kneeling down, patting, and smiling. At one point Riku pointed at me and said "Nana" so she may have been asking who I was. Oh, one thing that Riku did with total confidence today, with no hesitation, was to go over to a parallel bar, hang on tightly and swing his legs way up. He tried this a few times yesterday but today obviously decided he was an old hand at it. He demonstrated for me, and then went on to other more important activities. Just as we were leaving the park, Riku walked between two large supports, as he always does. One would have to be that small to do this, but today I was ahead of him and he called out "Nana, watch this!". I turned to see him with his body pressed between the two supports, basically wedging him in, with his feet up off the ground so he was supported by just his shoulders! It was hilarious and he stayed there, obviously quite comfortably while I stopped to get my camera out to take his photo. What fun this was to see; I can't wait to get the photos up online. </p>
<p>On our way to the park, just as we approached it, we passed a young woman from the park yesterday. She was there with her one-year-old daughter, who was just learning to walk. The little girl was smiling away at me and I was cheering her on with her practicing. So, when we met up today, the mom bowed to me and I bowed back. How lovely to be running into familiar faces! And to top it off, when we were walking through the building on our way upstairs, we passed the first mom we met in the playground here; we stopped to say "ohayo" to one another and to say hello to the children. </p>
<p>After an hour and a half of being very busy and on the go at the park, I knew that Riku would be hungry, despite his snack of half a banana, a package of new cookies Akane bought for him yesterday (brown rice biscuits that taste and smell very healthy; he liked them), and a little container of dried apricots and blueberries. His mommy had his lunch all ready for him when we walked in the door... a nice-sized bowl of rice (he and I had chatted about his having some rice for lunch today, so that was perfect), with fine strips of carrot, some spinach (we are making good use of the veggie box from Akane's aunts), little cubes of leftover tempura sweet potato, and fresh tomato. He ate all but two bites of it. </p>
<p>I so enjoy our little conversations about meals: me, after Riku pushes away his bowl, "All done or do you want more"  Riku: "all done" or "I okay". Me: "Ready for dessert?" Riku: "OK" Me: "Would you like strawberries?" Riku, big smile: "OK" Me: ... or an orange?" Riku pondering... and then: "an orange".  He will often make the big "ummmm" sound as he thinks about his choices. </p>
<p>Immediately after lunch I asked Riku if he knew what time it was, and his prompt answer was "bedtime". I told Akane yesterday about Kelly and Bryn just heading up the stairs automatically after lunch for their nap, singing "Up the stairs and into bed, Kelly Lynne. Up the stairs and into bed, Johnny Bryn (this made Akane laugh), up the stairs and into bed, you'll never get up you sleepy heads (not very reassuring, is it?), up the stairs and into bed" . I should really start singing this to Riku as Johnny Riku would work and is correct. Perhaps his dad and Auntie Kelly could come up with a verse that doesn't involve the going upstairs part, as he never goes up to bed! </p>
<p>So, diaper change, sit on the toilet for a minute, and into bed with his mommy for almost two hours. Akane appeared after an hour and had some time on the computer while I ate my boiled potato and hard-boiled-egg hot lunch, a favourite of mine and Gail's... with butter and pepper of course! I also made a nice big bowl of lightly sauteed spinach with butter and pepper to eat while the potatoes cooked. Delicious! </p>
<p>I chatted with Bryn on IM for a bit after answering a couple of emails; Riku and his mom were building some blocks, and then Riku and I got ready for his daily trek to the playground. I'm sure by now you all are very familiar with our routine! Ah, forgot the snack time... four sticks of Ontario cheddar that I brought here with me, a few nice big grapes, quartered, and a few thin sections of apple slices. </p>
<p>Riku has the sniffles, so Akane put an extra shirt on him before we left; good thing too, as it was much cooler and I put on his light jacket as well. The usual crew were down in the playground; Riku found a ball and was like a puppy, wanting anyone at all to play with him. At one point a fellow about twenty years old came out of one of the buildings with his mother. Riku waited until he was just past him and then threw the ball in that direction. Of course the man saw it, picked it up, and rolled it back to Riku. Well, wasn't Riku just so pleased with this! He got another two throws in before I rescued the man, by now almost at the end of the area. I often kick the ball around with him, but he really prefers to interact with the other children, or at least a new fan.</p>
<p>Akane joined us about 4:45 after she had been to the store for eggs and water: we get one free container a day, and usually go through it. The children all left early today, and since it was a bit chilly we decided to leave too; Akane wanted some Kentucky Fried Chicken; Riku wasn't ready to go home yet... as we turned the corner he said "no go home yet?" and when I told him we were going to the restaurant he said "OK, we go home later, we go to 'tore now". He and I sat and chatted at a round table with a square in the middle... one topic of conversation, after which we piled our hands on top of each other and pulled out the bottom one, something we haven't done in a while. </p>
<p>Home for dinner. Riku had some tomatoes, a bite of his mom's chicken, and some toast and butter; he wasn't terribly hungry right then, so he drew for a bit, played for a while, rode his bike around, and then asked if he could watch TV. He is probably feeling a little under the weather as his nose is slightly runny and he is sneezing. He didn't watch any yesterday or today, so Akane put on a children's tape of one of his favourite Japanese characters. I made him some oatmeal and sat beside him watching with him while I fed him. We watched two fifteen minute segments and then it was time for a hair wash at the kitchen sink. </p>
<p>Riku is getting better and better at taking off his own clothes and did so again tonight, tugging away at his pants, figuring out how to hook his fingers at the back to pull them down, and then his diaper, which went right into the garbage can in the kitchen. And then it was time to sit on the toilet... and he URINATED IN THE TOILET! He was ever so pleased with himself! I called to Akane to come and see and it lasted long enough that she too got to stand and clap and make a big fuss. Riku was just beaming away at us: I told him tomorrow we are going to go downstairs and buy him a present. I plan to buy several little cars/trains/planes to reward this behaviour, just as I did for his daddy all those many years ago. We did our usual wash/bath routine, although tonight the little duck was going to the bathroom, having BMs, and "duck sitting on toilet"... a little pail he has in the tub. </p>
<p>Oh yes, we are at a new phase indeed. He is determined to take off his own socks, really struggling to get the socks over his heels on his own, and he must be the one who turns the light on in the bathroom, opens the door, and does the reverse when he leaves. He also got to flush the toilet tonight, which he doesn't do if he doesn't "produce".</p>
<p>Akane tucked him in at 8:30 and he was asleep by 8:50. Hope he sleeps well, and that the stuffy nose is gone by tomorrow. </p>
<p>Meant to mention last night that I saw an interesting slogan on a six-year-old girl's t-shirt at the park yesterday "wee aged saucy girl"... whatever that means! and was quite taken aback by one worn by a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old on our walk this morning; it made me glad that Riku couldn't read... fill in the blanks, although I didn't have to... **** you, you ****ing ****er  ****!  Quite the statement, and I'm sure her parents have been told it means something quite different!</p>
<p>Took some interesting photos today... some of the narrow lanes I found myself in, more futons hanging on balconies, and a couple of vending machine contents. Fun to be walking along and having all these new experiences.</p>
<p>I'm off to bed... twenty minutes late, so let's hope that Riku sleeps in until 5:45 a.m. tomorrow! I can deal with my long busy days quite nicely with seven hours sleep but not any less!</p>
