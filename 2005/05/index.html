								<h2><a href="/2005/05/sunday_in_sakai_city.html">Sunday in Sakai City</a></h2>
								<p>This day started early, very early! I awoke at 3 a.m. but thanks to my little flashlight, I read for fifteen minutes and managed to get back to sleep, though only until 5:30 when Riku awoke! While Akane went to the bathroom, Riku decided to join me in my room. He was all ready for a story. "Small Pig" was his first choice and he looked at every single page so very carefully. At 6 a.m. he fell asleep holding the book, and slept for an extra half hour... not quite long enough for me, nor for him as he was fretful and not quite knowing what to do with himself. I held him, rocked him, told him about his room at our house with all his animals, books, the picture of the dreaming boy, etc. which was enough to distract him and make him grin up at me, ready to get on with his day. </p>
<p>6:50 found us in the kitchen, Riku sitting at the table "drawing?" while I made him oatmeal with flax seed, wheat germ, and blueberries. He ate every bite of it, in between drawings... starting with the yellow pencil and then when finished carefully putting each pencil back in its slot. Riku likes them all pointing the same way after using them, and none of them rolled over on top of another. It amazes me to see how meticulous he is. </p>
<p>Akane woke about 7:20 and joined us at the table to eat her BLC... cucumber instead of tomato today. While I hung up my clothes, Riku sat on my futon and looked at the rest of the books I brought, and discovered my flashlight which kept him very busy for at least twenty minutes. We even went into a couple of dark closets to really check it out; he loved it! </p>
<p>I went in to shower, and was very impressed with the service... Riku knocked at the door and had brought me my slippers! By the time I had finished showering and drying my hair, I realized that all was quiet.... Riku and Akane in bed for a nap. It was 8:40 and I knew there was no way my body was going to fall asleep. I sat and read quietly in the dining room, drinking hot water and relaxing. Akane came out an hour later; Riku slept for two and a half hours! </p>
<p>After a snack of raisin toast and orange juice, Riku and I left the apartment for some outdoor play time, but it was drizzling too hard and we ended up walking around the mall downstairs instead. He's completely fascinated with flora and fauna and inspected all the plants thoroughly, catching the attention of a couple of clerks who came over to say hello. </p>
<p>We were gone from noon until 1 a.m. and walked in to the smell of something very delicious cooking; Akane had a hot lunch almost ready for us... a wonderful tofu dish (my very favourite food of all!), with cabbage and Japanese bell pepper, another dish of Japanese cucumber and mekabu, an okra-like vegetable, rice, and a dish of scrambled eggs. Riku ate lots of egg, some tofu, and a little rice.</p>
<p>We played in the apartment after lunch (still raining), keeping busy building towers, drawing, and looking at all the animals on the memory cards I brought with me. At 3 p.m. "Buba", Riku's other grandmother stopped in for an unexpected visit, bringing for Riku a set of sand toys, a small red Elmo, and a beautifully cloth-wrapped dish for us for dinner!  </p>
<p>Riku was showing signs of being a tired boy, so at 4 p.m. I took him off to my room for a nap. He settled in quickly and was soon fast asleep, waking after an hour, fussing just a bit before rolling over and falling asleep again for a full hour and a half nap. Akane was sure it must have been the dreary, heavy weather, as we were both surprised. </p>
<p>After a snack of "more raisin toast?" and a few cashews we all left to do a little grocery shopping together downstairs... a huge grocery store and very handy. Riku is quite the little shopper, wanting to touch and admire all the little bottles and cans, but being very careful to put them back where they were. He also puts his hands behind his back like his Grandpa when told he can't touch the more fragile items. </p>
<p>While Akane came back with the groceries, Riku and I set out for our delayed walk, both in rain jackets, to find that the weather had cleared and that it was very pleasant, dry, and mild outside. We walked along a long and quite narrow road (I remember walking along this road while Akane was having labour pains and stopping long enough to breathe through it and continue on with Bryn and me) called "Shopping Road". It's often busy with cars and bikes but not so tonight. Riku was so happy to walk along and stop to splash in every single puddle he came across; there were dozens of them! He did take some time out to throw some rocks into an empty lot but the puddles were the main attraction. Before heading home, we walked to and through the big park again, with Riku finding enough puddles there to keep him happy too.</p>
<p>Lovely to have dinner all cooked up for us. Akane and I thoroughly enjoyed her mom's dish of mixed grains, bamboo, scrambled egg, shitake mushrooms and finely shredded carrot. Riku didn't eat much of it but ate some leftover tempura squash, a bit of egg, then a small container of yogurt, followed by a fruit plate with strawberries, grapes, and thinly sliced apples... a hit! </p>
<p>I did the dishes up, stood Riku in the bathroom sink to freshen him up a bit, put him on the toilet for the second time (forgot to mention this yesterday), and brushed his teeth. Akane went in to bed with him at 10:15 but Riku had a hard time settling down; he was still awake at 11:30(!), due it turned out, to a rare late-night BM... all that food today, no doubt! Akane had no idea what was going on with him; he would start to settle and then rouse himself again. I was in bed trying to sleep but not having much luck either; light finally out at midnight.</p>
<p>p.s. Riku counted to eight today; this is new to me, but he likes to count now and puts his fingers on the right objects as he moves along counting them. Wow!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/a_little_outing_today.html">A Little Outing Today</a></h2>
								<p>Ah, today I woke up at 4 a.m., an hour later than yesterday! Thanks to my little flashlight I read for fifteen minutes and went back to sleep. Riku and Akane were awake at 6 a.m.; I heard Riku playing happily, running around, so stayed tucked into bed reading for forty-five minutes. Riku was eating his yogurt, cnnamon toast, and orange juice, so I joined him at the table and read the two Franklin books to him.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Riku got busy in his kitchen, making his Nana tea and a bowl of porridge, stirring it vigourously after adding all four of his seasonings.... curry, salt, pepper, and paprika! </p>
<p>Akane was busy moving the computer from her bedroom into the tatami room, so we could use it while Riku naps. As soon as that was done, I checked my emails for the first time and spent quite a few minutes deleting too many junk mails! I watched a bit of Riku's favourite children's TV show with him; the most adorable small children were dressed up in costumes, whirling and swirling about to the music. </p>
<p>Off to shower and then we all sat at the table for breakfast. Akane had her BLC, Riku asked for "ebi"... shrimp, but only ate a few of the noodles in the dish. He was a tired boy... no kidding! after that late to bed night, so I tucked a reluctant little fellow into bed for a morning nap. He was asleep in less than seven minutes ("hold me, hold me") and woke at that forty minute point, not willing to go back to sleep and scratching at his neck. It almost looked as though he had an allergic reaction to somethiing so I cooled him off in the sink, and put some lotion on him.</p>
<p>While Riku ate some hot cereal, Akane was instant messaging with Bryn, and then he called and we spoke for a few minutes. And then it was a dash for the 12:02 train to Akane's doctor appointment. We made it and did a transfer to the area where the clinic is located. Riku enjoyed playing in the small toy room, mostly building very tall towers and playing "house" with the dishes and pots and pans. Nice, an engineer who likes to cook!</p>
<p>Akane saw the doctor; we have a new due date... December the 15th, not looking good for Bryn's wish for a late November birth! Akane had a second ultrasound done; the fetus looks much bigger than last week, but the angle is quite different too.</p>
<p>Akane was hungry and I remembered a nice little bakery where, two and a half years ago, Bryn and I used to buy an occasional egg sandwich; I remembered how good they were and after walking up the wrong road first, I mananged to find the right place. Akane bought Riku a round white roll and an egg custard, which he ate with gusto; she chose two tasty sandwiches for herself, sharing the egg half of an egg and ham sandwich with me. Yum!</p>
<p>We caught the train to the next station past ours, Sakainigashi, to try to find some new sandals for Riku; the ones I brought from home are too narrow for him. There is a smaller branch of the wonderful department store Takashimi, which I liked so very much on my last visit. Riku was as happy as could be in the toy department, mostly playing with a steering wheel with key, engine sounds, a horn, gear shifts, blinkers, etc, while Akane found a pair of casual and waterproof sandals for him. They look so big on his feet but he is a growing boy! </p>
<p>Before heading home we stopped down on the food floor, a wondrous place, and picked up some yogurt for Riku, bananas for me, and sushi for Akane for dinner. We walked home, about a forty minute walk, with Riku napping immediately. One the way back, just a couple of blocks from home, we spotted a very small stall selling fresh produce; Akane hadn't noticed it before and bought some sweet oranges. The prices were very good, so we will go back there again if the oranges really are sweet. Akane went right up to the apartment with the groceries while I continued on a long walk with Riku; he napped from 3:30 until 4:30, and we stopped for an hour's playtime in the little playground downstairs. There were two very friendly moms there with their children and Riku was a happy boy. </p>
<p>He was still fussy at home with not quite enough sleep under his belt, but ate a good sized dinner of scrambled egg, boiled carrot circles, 3/4 piece of whole wheat toast, a little squash, some cherry tomatoes (which he loves), strawberries, apple slices, and a cookie! While I gave Riku another sink bath to cool him off again, Akane went down for milk, eating her dinner when she returned. Riku sat right down and wanted some of her rice and ate quite a few bites of each of her crab dishes, plus two more tiny cookies. His daddy would have been amazed to see all that he tucked into! We certainly were. I just had to weigh him after this and sans diaper he was 12.5 kilos... 27 pounds, I believe. </p>
<p>After all this fuel, Riku played on his own, howling around the house, running at top speed, shouting!, laughing out loud, making <strong>us</strong> laugh out loud at his antics. What a character he is! Finally slowing down, he was ready for some drawing time and a story, and then tuck-in at 8:45. He wasn't asleep until 9:20, but was a happy boy... chattering away about his day I suppose.</p>
<p>Akane and I were tired as well, so she went off at 10:25 p.m. and I wrote one or two short emails, heading to bed at 10:45, tired and well exercised!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/a_perfectly_lovely_day.html">A Perfectly Lovely Day!</a></h2>
								<p>Once again I shall start off my blog by talking about my sleeping patterns!... waking at 3:30 a.m. and realizing that I am not making progress here at all! I think I am too warm and last night there were lots of sirens going off, and making a racket for a long time.  ,I did read and doze however, until I heard Riku being restless, starting at 5:30 a.m. He did go back to sleep though until 7 a.m. which is when I got up as well, </p>
<p>Riku is ready for his "yougurtttt!, as soon as he wakens so he had his usual breakfast and then played happily for a long time on his own with his blocks. Often he wants company (but don't try to help.... he just wants your presence, not your ideas!) but today was happy just to come and visit while I deleted those never-ending junk mails and wrote to Doug. Riku has a little riding car here and was carting along the five little rocks he brought home from the park last night., chatting with me as I wrote.</p>
<p>Breakfast time for me... Akane had made me a cup of hot chocolate, a treat, since I haven't had any since arriving, and I decided to have a bigger breakfast today of egg, toast, and "bacon". I thought Rike was engrossed in his children's tv program but no, he discovered I was eating and decided he really liked my sandwich! He ate a third of my first half and all of the second half!... grinning away as I protested. </p>
<p>Ayako, Akane's sister called to say she had the day off and suggested that she and Akane meet for lunch. I suggested they spend the day together, as there are lots of things here to keep Riku and I busy. Akane was delighted; Riku and I left at 10:15, leaving Akane time on her own to get ready, and walked over to the big playground. It was very hot and there is no protection, and the sandbox smelled of cat litter (to put it nicely). I scooped up as much as I could find (look for the flies hovering!) as Riku is far more interested in the sandbox than the single slide there. Other children joined us and Riku shared his toys, even though he always protests when it is suggested. Once the children are there he is Mr. Generosity.After building a few mountains with the others, we headed home at 11:30. too hot to be out there any longer. We did, however, walk through the gorgeous and huge rose garden, which will be in full bloom in a week or two with this heat. The paths are made of tiny stones, and paved, with uphills and paths heading down, so Riku was happy to just meander about on his own, checking once in a while to make sure I was watching him. </p>
<p>Home at noon hour and lunch was a big bowl of oatmeal with sliced, and very sweet, strawberries, some of which he ate while waiting for the cereal to cook. When Riku is hungry he always asks for yogurt! so I am now trying to have something else ready he can snack on immediately. He was down for his nap at 12:50, awake a half hour later!, and rocked into the second phase, sleeping until 3 p.m. </p>
<p>My lunch time, and I finished off the bit of leftover tofu/cabbge dish of Akane's, edaname beans, cold, and delicious!, the rest of the seaweed and mekabu salad, finishing off with tea and some quiet time for reading. </p>
<p>Snack time for Riku when he awoke... the rest of his toast, 1/2 of a banana, then the other half!, and dried cranberries and blueberries. This boy is happiest with a full tummy and I do my best to keep him happy.  While snacking, Riku often draws and today wanted me to draw along with him. He asked for a very specific thing though this time... his Daddy in a boat. We also talked about lightning and thunder, and he made lots of facial gestures to demonstrate that he knew just what I meant... hands over ears for "loud crashing" and  squinting for the lightning... very amusing for his Nana. </p>
<p>At 4 p.m. we left for our second outing of the day, but today Riku wanted to go "other way" when we left the building. What a good thing that I listened to him, as we discovered a lovely little playground between our building and the next... a small sandbox, a few spring riding toys, a little "woods" in behind (really the landscarping but with enough room for little ones to explore and still be easily seen), all in a vast protected area with no cars. Perfect! There were four other children there with their two moms, one of whom was particularly friendly with me and with Riku. Riku shared his shovels and pails so nicely, and theyin  turn let him play with their toys too. One of the moms handed out little packets of cookies, which won Riku's affection immediately! Riku loves to look at and admire growing things, so he went off collecting sticks and rocks in amongst the tiny bushes and small trees, and soon he had a whole crew helping him out. It was adorable and of course I took photos. </p>
<p>Riku was not happy to leave the area, so I told him he could use the key to open the door. You just hold the key in front of a sensor and was that a hit! Two big sliding doors opened up at his command, and he just beamed at his prowess! Of course he also always pushed the buttons for the "up" and "down" and the floor numbers as well. We just let others go ahead of us each time so they don't spoil his fun by pushing the buttons for him. </p>
<p>While waiting for his dinner, Riku had 1/2 slice of ww toast and five cherry tomatoes cut in half. Meanwhile, I cooked up ww "soupy" pasta for his dinner, with finely chopped spinach, mushrooms, tin<br />
bites of squash ; it was a huge hit with him. After two bites, he said "this is yummy". I thanked him and five bites later he told me again; this happened about five times throughout the meal! It was just so cute but he obviously enjoyed it very much, eating another half a bowl of it! </p>
<p>Tonight I bathed him in the sink, washing him down with soap and rinsing it off before standing him in the tall tub of cool water. I wasn't sure how to turn on the heat for the tub, but he was happy to slip in and then stand playing with his watering can and the two tub basins.</p>
<p>A very funny thing happened that deserves its own paragraph. As I put Riku in the tub, I told him that he had to tell me if he wanted to have a BM. This is a soaking tub  only, and filled high with water, so a BM floating around in there would not have been a good thing! At one point during play time, he said "uh oh!" and I asked him what was wrong. He said it again and I quickly picked him where he immediately let go of his bowels and left a large deposit on the covering of the tub! Whew! Good for him! He was very pleased with himself and it bodes well for toilet training as he obviously knew what was going to happen. A quick trip to the bathroom, another wash in the sink and back in the tub for a few more minutes of play time. Riku had quite the evening retelling me the story over and over! </p>
<p>It was humid so I left him in his diaper (after first putting him on the toilet) and he played with his dishes and blocks until Akane came home at 8:30. She and Ayako had a wonderful day out together and Akane came home bearing a wonderful gift for Riku.... a set of plastic food, stuck together with velcro, which can then be "cut" with a plastic knife. Riku had such a great time; he served us cake, cut into fours (with some effort!), oranges, melon,   hamburger, with and without a bun.... such fun! </p>
<p>It was hard to convince him it was bedtime but he was a tired boy and more than ready for it. after a promise of a bedtime story. He tucked in at 8:50 and was asleep at 9:15.I ate too late.... a bit of this and a bit of that, and then headed off to bed to read at 10:15.</p>
<p>p.s.</p>
<p>two cute extras:<br />
overheard Riku saying "Good job!" to one of his animals today and when I asked him, as he sat playing after lunch if he knew what time it was he looked up with his eyebrows raised and said "naptime?". Guess he is getting used to his Nana's routine! .</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/wednesday_here_tuesday_at_home.html">Wednesday Here, Tuesday at Home</a></h2>
								<p>I had a very early start to my day today, with Riku awake before 5:30 a.m.! I had slept from 10:30 to 4:30, then read and dozed for the next forty-five minutes, and that was that for the day. Yawn!!!! ... but then Riku keeps me going for the rest of the day, with not much time to think whether I am tired or not. He has enough energy for all the wondrous things out there for both of us. He walked into my room at 5:45, with his big smile, just so happy to begin a new day. Who could resist?</p>
<p>I quickly put together his berries/yogurt/toast daily special, and once he had polished that off, Akane came in with a five minute boiled egg, sprinkled with a generous amount of freshly ground pepper and he polished that off too! </p>
<p>I came into the tatami room to delete my junk emails and just as he did yesterday, Riku went into his whirling dervish mode, spinning, swirling, and really being loud, enjoying every minute of it, just as he did yesterday. Today, however, he stood with his legs spread way out, put his head on the floor making a bridge, and peeked at me with the biggest grin on his face. He howled when I got down on my fours to do the same for him. He spent five minutes crawling under my bridge, as I turned from one end to another so he could see my face between my legs first. Good thing I don't have high blood pressure! </p>
<p>After showering I went to have a light breakfast, starting with a banana. The other day Akane and I had a discussion where she told me that my Bryn and Riku don't care for bananas and she had stopped buying them. I need them for the potassium and of course they are high in fibre, so I commented that it was a shame that Riku didn't like them as they are so good for him. Well, I think he was listening as I had shared a banana with Akane, which Riku spotted, wanted it and then ate the other half of my second one! Now he is a daily banana guy, just like his Grandpa! </p>
<p>This boy needed his nap, so I decided to take him out in the stroller for a change; it would be cooler and I could use the long walk. We left the apartment at 9:15 a.m. He had asked Akane for "pain".... the Japanese use the French word for bread, and Akane told me Riku's favourite.... a long sweet dough bun with a glaze of sugar on top.... called a Danish roll here. There is, too handily, a wonderful bakery just downstairs, with very friendly staff, and which I am trying hard to ignore this trip! Riku sat happily in his stroller eating it and five minutes later was sound asleep. So much for the theory of sugar hyping up children! </p>
<p>I walked steadily for two hours! Why I don't weigh 100 pounds, I would like to know! There was a nice cool breeze and so was perfect for his nap and for my walking him. Riku napped for eighty minutes of our time out; it wasn't quite long enough as he just lay there on the final few blocks home, not sitting up and being chatty as usual. I walked a good long way along a road that ran beside a train track. It was an interesting walk and I took several photos... duvets and comforters hung up to air, not five feet from the train tracks(!), very old dilapidated buildings standing right next to quite lovely and large modern homes, with beautiful gates, old tile roofs, and beautiful landscaping. So many folks ride bikes here, and I am amazed at how many of them appear to be in their seventies and eighties. I was also very surprised to see an elderly man urinating in an empty clay flower container (but no flowers) right in public with no obvious sense of being uncomfortable as I walked by. Akane told me later that this is very common. At home only a homeless person would do this, or a drunk, and not so openly either but here the feeling is that if nature calls then you answer the call. Sounds fine to me; he wasn't being obvious, just doing what needed doing. </p>
<p>Back at home, Akane was preparing <em>pad thai</em> for our lunch, a lovely treat indeed. Much better than the peanut butter on toast I had planned; I was hungry too, as I had forgotten to eat some almonds after my not-half banana(!), and so the lunch was especially welcome. Riku and I played with his blocks while Akane finished cooking, and preparing a slightly pickled carrot and cucumber dish, which was delicious as well. I also snuck in a little msn chat with Bryn before lunch as well.</p>
<p>Riku didn't eat much of his lunch, but a half hour later he finished every bite of the pasta dish from last night (one and a half servings of it) and a half dish of leftover oatmeal with strawberries. He was soon drooping with tiredness, not having napped quite long enough this morning to make up for that much-too-early awakening.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the bedroom was too warm and Riku slept only forty minutes, but I held him and he immediately went back to sleep. Akane came in and turned on the air-conditioning and he slept another hour. Whew! </p>
<p>Akane did not feel great today; she napped in the morning with Riku and again in the afternoon, so when Riku and I went to the little playground downstairs, I suggested that she bathe and come and meet us  there. Akane enjoys her bath time and so far I have managed to be out with Riku during that time so that she can bathe at her leisure in a quiet house. </p>
<p>The very friendly mom was there again with her two children; I thought the younger one, three months younger than Riku, was a girl, but later in the evening Akane told me that she was sure the woman was referring to the child as a "him"... another pretty boy in our midst! Riku was so delighted to have company again, and today he played with a pushcar and a tricycle as well as wandering in his "woods". I fed him snacks as he played and he also shared some candy from the other mom. </p>
<p>Akane did join us, and had a chat with the mom; we mostly smile at each other although she does speak a bit of English... could ask where I was from... Canada, and San Francisco... and we managed to communicate with gestures. However, it was very nice for Akane to meet her; this family lives in the  buidling opposite ours, and so far she has been in the playground each day around 4 or 4:30 for an hour or so. After twenty minutes we all gathered up our sand toys, and off we went to the grocery store for water (we get one free jug a day), butter, and bananas! </p>
<p>Riku and I strolled on ahead to the condo building, and he delighted two women with his door opening skills! They smiled and chortled away at him, and he smiled back. of course, waving and saying "buh bye! as we dashed to push the buttons on the elevator before they could! We started playing an elevator game the other day... as we wait for one of the four to appear, I say... "I wonder which elevator is going to come first? I think <strong>this</strong> one!", and point to one. Riku then looks around, chooses one and says "I think <strong>this</strong> one!" and then we wait to see who won. I call out "I won!" or Riku calls out "I won!" and sometimes of course I have to say "no one won" which Riku repeats after me. </p>
<p>Dinner time... whole wheat "'mac' and cheese" as they say in the States. I brought some Trader Joe's ww with organic white cheddar "Kraft dinner" equivalent with me, and it was a hit with our little man. I added finely chopped spinach to it, as well as sautéed mushrooms; Riku ate two really good-sized helpings of it, and then ate lots of cherry tomatoes, apple slices, and another whole banana! Akane was really amazed at how much he is eating and we laugh about the banana business every time he asks for one. </p>
<p>After dinner, Riku got busy in his little kitchen again, asking if we "Want dinner?" Sure... and I told him I would like mushroom soup. He stirred and added several shakes of all possible shakes, brought it over to me, "ate" some himself, but when Akane asked for a taste he told her no. Riku does not always like to share his food and we are working on it. He did serve both of us several pieces of the little cake from his new set, though, and had a thorough discussion with Akane in Japanese about "what is this?" while pointing to the icing, the little green decoration, and the strawberries on the top of each slice. I think he knew about the strawberries but was double checking just in case. </p>
<p>The evening ended with story time, as usual, after some more building time. We read "Franklin" and "Are You my Mother?"... but before heading to bed, he sliced up more fruit and veggies with his knife and "clean up, clean up" leaving his kitchen in perfect order. His mom tucked him in at 9:15 and ended up staying there herself. I turned in at 11:15... too late again, but at least I managed to send off an email to Doug and get my first blog written... good thing I have been keeping a detailed journal or the past few days would have been a blur! ... busy, busy days here... and such fun to have this big block of time here with Riku and Akane.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/a_visit_with_buba_and_gigi.html">A Visit with Buba and Gigi</a></h2>
								<p>Happy birthday Gram! I thought of her as soon as I woke up this morning, which was at 5:30 when I heard Riku. However, I went back to sleep for another hour; Gram didn't sleep late, so it is only fitting that I am awake at the crack of dawn on her day. </p>
<p>Later, Akane told me that Riku had had a bad dream; he called out asking for cookies! Life is tough when you're just two. At 6:30 Riku opened my door, greeting me with that big "good morning" grin of his. I sent him out for a diaper; his drawers were definitely drooping! Akane had gone back to bed so after a diaper change up we got for breakfast, with his... yes!... yogurt and berries and orange juice. Just a half a slice of toast today; guess his tummy is full from all that pasta yesterday! </p>
<p>We have been invited to the Goda's today at 11:30, to have a look at the new house and for lunch out at a noodle restaurant. We are going to walk there, about an hour's walk, and knowing Riku might need just a little more nap time than that came up with this plan. Riku and I left the house at 9 a.m. for some time in the playground on the 2nd floor (outside), leaving Akane alone to have her bath. This worked well; Riku was delighted to be there, even with no other children today, and we built a big "mountain", placing tiny sticks and leaves in the top of it. Before leaving forty-five minutes later, Riku asked me to make a C, W, S, T, and B in the sand, so we left it all there for the next lot of children. </p>
<p>We stopped in the apartment just long enough to change Riku's clothes, and then headed off for a walk around the big blocks surrounding these two huge complexes. Riku fell asleep almost immediately, thank goodness, and we met Akane as planned at 10:30 at the door. It was only a forty minute walk and Riku awoke just as we approached the corner of their street. He knew where we were going and was happy to have arrived. </p>
<p>I had seen the house two and a half years ago when it was first built, but it was not furnished or landscaped. Now there are flowers and greenery in the front yard, and the tatami room, where we sat, is painted a lovely soft sage green. I remembered the beautiful expanse of light coloured wooden floors and the large American-style kitchen, although was only in the tatami room and the upstairs bathroom this visit. I really would have liked to have taken photos but was not sure that it would be polite to ask; later I checked with Akane and she said she is sure her mom would have been just fine with that. Perhaps I will get over there again. </p>
<p>Mrs. Goda, Riku, and I sat in the tatami room, at the long and wide wooden table, seated on very comfortable low wooden chairs with padding and backs. It was perfect for me as one can stretch out and yet still be close to the table. We admired Mrs. Goda's soft watercolours of the fish she has painted; she is taking painting classes and the fish were lovely. </p>
<p>Akane was upstairs with her sister Ayako, who now lives there, and Mrs. Goda served Riku and me delicious cold drinks made from vegetables and fruit, and put out a plate of soft and tender cookies to nibble on. Riku was very content sitting there until he had eaten his cookie, and then went dashing off to find his Auntie Ayako. </p>
<p>She, Akane, and Riku all joined us there a few minutes later. It was so nice to see Ayako again, with her big smile. She managed to tell me that my face was much slimmer and that I had lost weight since the last time; this is true and it was nice that she thought to tell me so. I worked out later that I have actually lost about 6 kilos since then. </p>
<p>Ayako came downstairs carrying her old doll house, complete with furniture. It is a simple wooden structure open on one full side, and Riku was intrigued. He put out the tiny table and two chairs, checked out the bed and the dressers, but mostly liked the three-inch teddy bear mommy and daddy, spending most of his time propping them up and talking to them. The most wonderful thing about it to my eyes were several of Mrs. Goda's pieces of furniture from when she was a child... beautifully made, tiny sofa and chairs with backs that lean back, a vanity with three sided mirrors, although the middle one was missing. Akane said it was there when she played with it many years ago, so Ayako must have damaged it! </p>
<p>Mr. Goda arrived home from his shop around the corner and after admiring a newly-discovered pair of photos of him when he was a much younger man, we set off for lunch, a "Denny's" just a few blocks away. I'm not sure what happened to the noodle restaurant plan, but perhaps it was because there was a local festival going on which they wanted us to go to; we passed it on the way to "Denny's". </p>
<p>The restaurant is obviously popular as we had to wait to be seated. There were a few possible items on the menu for me... one a pasta and tomato dish but served cold, which wasn't appealing at the moment, a gratin with asparagus, and a lasagna, but both of these had meat in them. Akane also asked about the egg salad sandwich at the same time, and the waitress came back saying they could make it without meat. It was delicious with lots of romaine lettuce in it, and fries along with it, a bonus for me! However, the servings here tend to be more modest so I didn't feel guilty about the dozen fries I ate. </p>
<p>Riku had French toast; he ate only about a dozen pieces of it, but pouring the maple syrup over each piece very carefully, so that he didn't run out before the end of them, and then tipping the tiny container right upside down at the end of the it, making sure he didn't miss a drop. While eating it he carefully picked up each piece with the long yellow plastic sword that had held my sandwich together, dipping each piece into the syrup on the plate. This kept him busy for quite a while but then he was restless and wanted to move. A couple of children's books in the entrance way saved the day... "Thomas the Train" in Japanese. </p>
<p>Off we all went, walking very slowly as Riku explored this new area. Auntie Ayako had a few little races with him, which helped a bit, and finally she, Riku, and I ended up walking along a narrow yellow line in the middle of the sidewalk; this was enough action for Riku to keep him out of the way of the cyclists who ride on the sidewalks, often at great speed. </p>
<p>The festival was very small, but Riku and Ayako had fun at the little "fishing" booth, a tub filled with small balls. He was supposed to use a flat and very small net but found that just reaching in and taking the balls was so much more efficient! A young man decked out in full motorcycle regalia captured his attention too; Riku thought he was a robot and was delighted when the man bent down to talk to him. </p>
<p>After wandering around a bit more we headed home, stopping at the shop so that Mr. Goda could oil the squeaky wheels on the stroller. While we were standing outside on our way back to the house, just around the corner, a couple of neighbours stopped by to say hello. They were a mother and pregnant daughter, who pointed out to Riku that there was a baby "in there" pointing to her stomach. Riku said "I see it?"  Another woman from across the way was there too, and all of them made quite a fuss over our boy. Of course Riku is just so open and friendly with everyone so his big smile and sweet face won them over. The last gal said goodbye, returning a couple of minutes later with a little stuffed zebra for him; it is adorable, and Riku held it until he fell asleep in the stroller on the walk home. </p>
<p>We left Mrs. Goda at her place at 3 p.m. Riku held off sleeping for a half hour and then slept until 5:30, with me walking him around a new area the entire time. We did stop first at a new market Akane hadn't noticed before; she bought quite a few big oranges the gal assured her were very sweet; the prices were quite low so it may be a good place to know about. </p>
<p>I knew that Riku would be very hungry after his not very large lunch (he did eat some banana and toast in the stroller) so I made him the new and improved version of Kraft dinner... Trader Joe's whole wheat macaroni with organic white cheddar cheese. I added spinach to it, and while he was waiting to eat, I gave him a plate with the sweetest little cherry tomatoes ever; Riku eats them like they are candy! He ate a very generous portion of the mac' and cheese, and then ate the rest I had already put in the fridge for tomorrow. He topped that off with a cookie Mrs. Goda had sent home with us, and some orange sections. Riku sits at the table so nicely while he eats and I make sure that one of us is sitting with him for company. Akane had curry and rice for her dinner and I made some ginger "chicken" I had brought from home, along with freshly cooked rice and spinach with orange sections... delicious! </p>
<p>After dinner, I cleaned up the kitchen and then washed Riku's hair in the kitchen sink, lying him on a towel on the counter. This worked well and he enjoyed it. I have been encouraging Riku to help undress himself and it's often funny to see the twists and turns he makes trying to get his pants or overalls down, or his shirt over his head. He took his diaper off too, and once again he sat on the toilet before his bath. He doesn't want to sit there too long but at this point it's just a matter of having him comfortable and with an idea of what is supposed to happen. </p>
<p>I had asked Akane to turn the water temperature down on the deep tub for Riku, and at ten degrees lower than is comfortable for Akane, Riku was a happy boy. I first stand him up on the counter of the bathroom sink and soap/wash him down. The tub is not for getting clean but for soaking and relaxing in after washing. The water is much too deep for Riku to sit in; it comes up to his armpits when standing so stand he does. He really enjoys it. I sit on one of the panels on one side and there is another panel on the right; Riku stands between the two, and plays with his watering can, and two bathing plastic containers. What fun he had, splashing about and the water was just right for cooling him off a bit. Akane said it was at body temperature which seemed perfect for Riku... not too chilly getting in, and still warm at the end of the tub time, but not too hot, which Riku does not like at all. He splashed about and I sang him a song about a duck swimming. I think I have two of Kelly's songs mixed in together but Riku was fine with that! </p>
<p>With a clean little fellow all ready for bed, Riku had time for drawing (we have been making coloured dots this past couple of days; he likes me to name the colours as I make them), then he had time with Akane building blocks. I was checking my email during this time and of course he wandered over to see what I was doing; he ended up sitting on my lap while we looked at Tracy and Brad's photos of a trip to Bermuda. At one point he said "there Nana in water" and when I told him it was Tracy he quickly changed the sentence to "there Tracy in water". Riku so enjoys looking at photos, even when they are not of him. Perhaps he will be a Creative Memories consultant when he grows up! </p>
<p>At the end of his day we read his choice of books, "Small Pig", and he flipped back several times to the JUNK YARD page, checking out all the things broken and saying "uh oh!" with such fervor. We named all the letters in JUNK YARD and now when he comes to that page he says 'junk yard", pointing to the words. </p>
<p>He wanted his mommy to tuck him in (I don't lie down with him!) and so off they went, Akane (it turned out) for the evening too, at 9:30. I managed to get one and three-quarters of a blog done and then lost half of the latter! I was so frustrated and went to bed too late, at 12:05 a.m</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/quiet_day_in_sakai.html">Quiet Day in Sakai</a></h2>
								<p>Woke up at 6:45 after a great sleep, with a little boy knocking at my door, peeking in, shutting the door, and repeating it, giggling all the while. We got right up and had breakfast; Riku not quite so hungry this morning but ate his yogurt and a few banana bites. He entertained himself very nicely for a good half hour or more this morning; I am finding that the more running around time he has outdoors that the less attention he needs inside. I think he's pretty tired after all the stimuation and so is happy playing on his own. </p>
<p>I got started at my blog again and then it was time for his little tv show. I watched for a few minutes with him before going off to shower. When I finished up, Akane and Riku were in bed for naps so I sat and enjoyed the hot chocolate Akane had prepared for me and a dozen almonds. The phone rang during this time, waking both Akane and Riku, but he was quite willing to go back into the bedroom with Akane. </p>
<p>A few minutes later there was a knock on the door, and there was a flower delivery... for me! from Akane and Bryn. A lovely bouquet of soft colours... pale pink roses, some very pale lilac delicate flowers, new to me, gorgeous peach coloured roses, a few deeper pink, and two pale yellow mums, all smaller versions that is typical... beautiful. Akane had arranged for them on the day she was out with Ayako. </p>
<p>Riku slept only an hour in total but happily sat at the table drawing. We also read both Franklin books before he was ready to get down and play with his cars. As soon as I finished a blog, Riku and I went over to the big park for some fresh air and exercise. This was just the best part of the day for me, as it is a large and today, mostly empty, space. Riku was oh-so-happy just wandering about... up the small hill (he is practicing running down these days), and then up the longer and less steep hill, stopping now and again on this rock and pebble strewn area to stoop down and pick up a rock. "Oh, a rock!" says Riku as though  they are a rare commodity. I guess that particular rock is, in Riku's mind! He struggles to keep all these rocks in his hands, and sometimes passes them on to me if a particular stick catches his eye. </p>
<p>He did wander over to the playground but the slide was very wet from the rain yesterday and he changed his mind. There is a cemetery right next door though; I had noticed stone statuary a few days ago but had not realized it was a cemetery until Riku and I climbed up the hill. So, we meandered around there, noticing several people coming to light incense, fold their hands together and bow in front of the statues, all with a red apron-like cloth tied around their middles or a band on their heads. The statues surround one edge of the cemetery so we walked around the inner area as well; it's not very well maintained, with long grass and lots of weeds around many of the individual gravestones and the big family blocks of several monuments. Riku discovered quite a well-kept one, one of the larger ones there, surrounded by the most beautiful red and yellow stones. He had to be convinced to leave them behind! A young man came in while we were there, and I noticed on our way out that he had poured buckets of water over one stone of several on that site, and then stood bowing for a few minutes, before dashing off on his motor scooter. </p>
<p>Riku was obviously flagging by the end of this adventure so I put him in his stroller for snacks (the rest of his banana, a few pretzels and a dozen or so cheddar cheese bunnies from Auntie Susan). I thought we would walk for a bit but it started to rain so home we went. Akane prepared ww pasta with spinach and tomatoes for him, after asking for pasta!, but he wasn't eating much. Meanwhile, I prepared a "bacon" and egg sandwich for myself... and you can guess what happened. He wanted some "bacon" so I bribed him... one bite of pasta and a tiny bite of "bacon"; this worked very well until he decided he wanted some egg too. I ended up with only a half sandwich for lunch today. </p>
<p>He and Akane went to bed after a little playtime but it was a short nap again. He ate blueberries and apricots for his snack along with a few bites of his mom's rice. Time to get playing again and once again he wrapped up his dog and zebra and walked around being such a good "daddy" to them. </p>
<p>Akane didn't feel well from about 3:30 on. She was worried about the pregnancy, as there had been signs she hadn't experienced before. Bryn was on IM and they chatted about it before Bryn got me online to see what I thought about it; the best thing would have been for Akane to see her doctor but he is not available after 1 p.m. Bryn contacted their on-call doctor who assured him that all was probably well and told us what signs to look for if a problem did exist... shivering, cramping, high fever, etc. Thank goodness none of these are an issue but it was a worrisome time. </p>
<p>Feeling somewhat assured, and after reading a bit to Riku, Akane dressed and we all went out to the library on the third floor of this building. Riku and I settled in on the mat of the children's area, after taking off our shoes, while Akane continued on to the grocery store. </p>
<p>Riku had such a good time, pulling out all the train and truck books he could find, which included a dozen "Thomas the Train" books in Japanese.  A little girl, about eleven months old, came in with her mom. She was the sweetest little thing, smiling away at me and trying to get over to Riku's stack of books. He was very attentive to her; he cooed at her and said "hi baby", touched her cheek gently with his finger, lay down on the floor near her and showed her books... her mother was delighted with him and I was very proud of him. We were there about forty-five minutes, then went outside intending to take a little stroll. However, it was raining and blowing so back to the mall we went and up to the 29th floor. Riku walked in calling for his mom, but she wasn't there; a few minutes later there she was, with the water jug and some groceries. I felt quite reassured knowing she was feeling well enough to have stayed out so long. </p>
<p>Riku was hungry; the minute he asks for yogurt it is time to get some solid food in him. Once a day is the rule for yogurt, so I put out a plate of cherry tomatoes, half a slice of buttered ww toast (brought from SF... it's really hard to find full whole wheat bread here), and after eating that he ate a full serving of four grain cereal and most of a container of ice cream. It was really frozen solid but Riku scraped away patiently at it with the edge of his spoon and did a great job of working his way through three quarters of it. At one point Akane asked if she could have a bite; it was a very tiny bite and so she asked again. Once more she got a mere scraping of ice cream even though his own bites seem to be much larger! However, once he had had enough he was more than happy to give the container to Akane. </p>
<p>After dinner, Riku rode his "car" around, making very loud noises and wheeling around the furniture at breakneck speed, slowed down long enough to make a meal for us in his kitchen, calling out "dinner's ready!" when he was finished, and then looking at a magazine with his mom for a bit. </p>
<p>Once again I gave him a sink wash and then a standing play time in the soaking tub; he is such a relaxed little fellow after this routine that I am reluctant to give it up. He really loves making big splashing wave action and asked for the duck song again. Riku really relaxes while having lotion applied to his legs, arms, tummy and back. Akane sets up the diaper and shirt and then sits with us while I do his little routine with the massage. </p>
<p>Before tuck in time, Riku had another half slice of toast and half a banana which he ate while having his story of choice... "Small Pig" read to him. Once again he went back time and time again to the junk yard page to name all of the things on the page. </p>
<p>Akane tucked him in at 9 p.m. and stayed in with him for the night; I blogged and emailed until 12:10 but was asleep by 12:30.</p>
<p>Today would have been Mrs. Dyment's birthday; I thought several times today of how much she would have enjoyed getting to know this little fellow of Bryn's and Akane's. I know she would have been as smitten as the rest of us.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/my_big_helper.html">My Big Helper!</a></h2>
								<p>A banner day today; I was the first one awake, at 6:45 a.m.! All was quiet and, unwilling to be the one to disturb anyone (I know I should have gone in and wakened Riku with my big "good morning" smile but Akane wouldn't have appreciated it!), I sat in bed finishing up my journal for last night. I had been too tired to write in those few last details after finishing up on the computer so late. </p>
<p>I did get up and shower at 7:30 and Akane and Riku were in the kitchen; they woke up just as I was getting into the shower. What a good sleep they both had! Akane said she was awake a few times in the night, but she had such a nice early start to the night that it must have felt great. </p>
<p>Two yogurts for Riku today, one with blueberries and one with fresh strawberries. Yum! Akane often buys vanilla yogurt for him and this tastes like dessert. Once again Riku played happily on his own, down on the floor with his blocks and cars, chatting away to himself, and keeping busy. At one point he watched a short Saturday tv show for children, and then put on "A Bug's Life". Riku watched it quite intently for a bit, then I sat beside him on a chair and we talked about "what is this?" and "what is happening" and "uh oh!", retelling the story for his and my sake, I suppose. Once I went to get my breakfast Riku went back to just looking up now and then, the way his daddy watched TV at this age.</p>
<p>Akane was obviously feeling much better today, as after eating no dinner last night, she was up to a small piece of pizza and a small bowl of leftover spaghetti for breakfast. I am now trying to save the whole wheat bread for Riku, so instead of toast with peanut butter, I had a bowl of oatmeal with dried apricots and blueberries, flax seed, and wheat germ. Yum! </p>
<p>It's another gray overcast day, but we need to get out nonetheless. I asked Riku if he wanted to go to the big park or the playground and he chose the big park. I know he loves having the freedom to wander so far on his own and yet still have me in sight. We climbed the big hill again, picked up lots of rocks, threw some of them into a huge puddle. I was the stone-picker-upper and Riku said "thank you" each time I handed him one, and "Oh, big one! Thank you." for the favourite large ones. They do make a much more impressive splash after all. We looked at the statues again today but headed off into the rose garden with its diverging pathways; Riku chooses whether to take the ramps or the steps and then I go "other way" and we meet up. We were gone from 11-12:30 and I had a hungry boy on my hands when we walked in the door.</p>
<p>Riku ate yet another big helping of the cherry tomatoes we reserve for him, while waiting for his own "bacon" and egg half-sandwich and a few bites of Akane's rice. She also had some prepared potato salad, which is a very popular dish in Japan and available in small individual containers in almost every small store and in all of the supermarkets. </p>
<p>Akane's two aunts (her father's sisters) had sent her a big box filled to the brim with produce. Akane can't imagine how they thought she could possibly eat all of this food but she will share some with her mom's household. In the box were: a huge but not fresh head of broccoli, 3 eggplants, a bag of six good-sized onions, 5 potatoes, a big bag of not very fresh green peas (Akane loathes green peas and I ate a few of them raw before deciding I had better cook them), a big bag of fava beans, four lovely tomatoes, a huge cabbage, a stick of sticky yam, the biggest kabocha squash I have ever seen, 2 bunches of lovely spinach, two big carrots (they are usually sold two to a bag!), and five slender Japanese cucumbers! We now have more than enough produce to see us through to the end of my visit. </p>
<p>After lunch, I got busy shelling the peas. Riku was in the tatami room, playing with his cars, and I thought he might like to see the fresh peas in the pods. He did indeed. I started opening them and Riku would rub his finger down the middle of them to slide them into a bowl. Then I decided to have him try to open the pods. It was a bit of a challenge but he really worked away at it, until finally he was opening all of the pods, with some effort, taking out each pea, and then pulling the pods in two to pile up on the table.. I have no idea why they needed separating and Riku wasn't saying. It was the cutest thing; he stood solemnly beside my chair, working away very seriously at it, and showing much delight in the growing pile of peas in the bowl. He did try one but didn't like it; too bad they weren't young and really fresh as he  may have liked them then. I cooked them up and will use them over the next couple of days. </p>
<p>Riku spent quite a bit of time playing with his two stuffed pets on my bed, chatting away to them, covering them up, walking around with them... quite a busy little guy today. He went on to play cars and airport and I joined him after writing a huge blog and somehow deleting it, despite having "saved" after each paragraph! Argggh, it was so very frustrating, but playing parking lot at the airport really puts things in perspective. </p>
<p>At 4 p.m. we went down to our little playground. Not one child was in view when we arrived, but within minutes there were at least eight children there, ranging in age from about 2 to 10. Today was the first weekend day we have been there so it was fun to see some older children. How this changed the dynamics of the playground for Riku! Within minutes he had his own "posse"! I'm not sure why but he just became the leader and four children just ran after him, chasing the ball he threw everywhere... into the "woods", through a fence, and into the garden area. It really was funny to see. He was being very vocal, meaning that he was whooping it up and shrieking out loud; I have never heard him be so loud before. The other very amusing thing was that Riku would run deliberately into a not-huge puddle there (I had rolled up his pants when we first arrived) and it was obvious that not one of the children would do such a thing. Every time that Riku did it, they would all laugh a little nervously, which of course made Riku run through again and again. </p>
<p>For part of the early time there, I was reading on the bench. Two little girls came up and said "hi", and spoke a little Japanese to me. It became obvious to them that I didn't understand them, but they came in a little closer, standing within a couple of inches from me, obviously interested in what I was reading. I pointed out the word "I' to them, said it and then pointed to myself. They did the same. Very good! I found the work "you" next and did the same in reverse... and so did they. </p>
<p>At one point, they were with Riku alone in another area, and I was standing nearby just watching them. Somehow it was obvious they wanted me to talk to them, so I sang "head and shoulders, knees and toes" and that was a hit! I sang it about six times, and Riku was saying "more" each time, which meant that they too were saying "more" when it finished. They were very pleased with themselves, as well they should  have been! </p>
<p>A couple of the boys were near the bench as well and we all sang "ABC" together. They had a skipping rope with them and were showing me how well they skipped. I took a turn too, which they thought was very funny, and managed to get up to twenty after a couple of bad starts... cluncky sandals and close to fifty years without practice is my excuse. They clapped for me, as I did for them. One boy, about seven or eight, was a master skipper! He could twist the ropes as he jumped, and he jumped really well and high. Akane told me later that they jump rope in exercise class; what a great idea. I don't know if children jump rope at home anymore. </p>
<p>One sad thing happened to Riku there today though; a young boy kicked Riku very hard and made him cry. The child had already poured sand over one boy, and hit another and made both of them cry. I think he thought Riku was going to take the tricycle away from him so he hit him really hard in the knee area. Tears just poured from Riku; he was shuddering, and upset that anyone could do such a thing. The child's mother gave him a good scolding but of course she should have just taken him out of the playground after the second, if not the first, incident. The time there ended happily though, with time in the sandbox, playing with the bigger girls. </p>
<p>Akane thought she might join us at 5:30 to go to the grocery store; we waited until 5:45 but it was getting cold and we left. Riku did his usual swell job with the front door key, and just as he had pushed the number 29 on the elevator, Akane stepped out. We all went to the store together, Riku retelling the "boy hit Riku, Riku cry, boy mommy angry, boy cry" story many times. He was pretty restless in the store, not staying with me, and losing his baggie of beloved rocks, so we left Akane to buy the tomatoes and bananas, and came upstairs to start dinner. Riku's... tomatoes for a starter, the rest of his French toast, carefully eaten with the saved pick from my sandwich yesterday, and big bites of Akane's sushi roll... "What is this?" when biting into the large long piece of squid in the center of it and then "scary" when Akane told him; he was having none of it, spit it into his bib holder, and wanted it out of there fast! Didn't blame him a bit actually; it did look quite disgusting! He had more tomatoes, a few apple slices and a banana. </p>
<p>Tired boy by this time so into the sink/tub routine we went. He was so relaxed and so ready for bed at the end of it all; he always wants his mom to tuck him in, but Akane was not feeling well at all, shivery and ill; she said Riku could sleep with me. I was expecting a fuss from Riku, as it's the first time I have ever slept with him, but he accepted his fate very nicely, allowed me to read "Small Pig" to him, and was asleep in minutes, at 8:45. </p>
<p>I wrote in my blog, did the dishes, tidied the table, admired my flowers, and went to sleep at 11:30, moving Riku over to his own side of the bed!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/happy_mothers_day.html">Happy Mother's Day</a></h2>
								<p>... and it started off just perfectly with a little fellow snuggled in bedside me, fast asleep, until 7:28 a.m.!  I had a few minutes lying awake beside him, just enjoying that little boy sleeping so peacefully. And then he was awake! and up! and ready to start his day. </p>
<p>Bryn had sent an envelope with me for Akane for Mother's Day but when she opened it there were two other envelopes inside; one for me and one for Riku, asking us to take care of each other. I didn't see Akane's but Bryn told me later that the three fit together to form a little puzzle so I will see that later on. He also sent three tiny boxes, each holding two chocolates; neither Akane nor I were quite sure what they were for, or for whom, but they are for us!!! Riku is delighted but we two haven't eaten ours yet. We must give them to Riku earlier in the day in case he is caffeine sensitive; we don' t need this child staying awake any longer at night! </p>
<p>We had our very typical morning routine.... breakfast immediately, a couple of stories at the table, "kitchen" time for Riku, and today, getting ready to leave the house at 10 a.m. for a Mother's Day treat from Akane and Bryn... a pedicure for me at Takishimaya! Mrs. Goda is going to have her first manicure at the same time. I had understood yesterday that Mrs. Goda had a school reunion meeting to go to so we would not be seeing her. However, Akane had spoken with her mom last night while I was bathing Riku; she was feeling so rotten when I went in to ask her about sleeping arrangements for Riku that she forgot to tell me about the pedicure. What a nice surprise! </p>
<p>The plan was to leave at 10 a.m. and catch a bus; I preparedd snacks for Riku, as well as some lunch to take with us and Akane got involved with laundry, lost track of the time, and was late bathing. Instead of taking the bus we took a cab at 10:35. Riku was very excited by this prospect; we walked over to the taxi stand and he climbed happily into the back, saying "hi man" to the driver, who obviously had no idea he was being spoken to.  Riku could see buses, buildings, and cranes from the back seat, and the ride was over too soon for him. I told Riku he could say goodbye to the man; he did, the man smiled and said "bye bye" back to him, leaving our boy smiling. </p>
<p>We met Mr. and Mrs. Goda at the door of the store, said a quick hello goodbye to him, and off we went to the nail salon on the fourth floor. Akane was planning to walk with Riku in the stroller for his nap and meet us in an hour. After Akane filled out my form, I was shown into a private little room for my pedicure while finger nails were done in the front space of the "salon".</p>
<p>Well, to say this manicure was bliss would be an understatement. I was almost asleep during the soaking/masssage part of the treatment. The young woman doing my treatment was very sweet and very good at what she does; she spoke a bit of English, having taken a three month course following a trip to Australia two years ago. I was in the room for an hour and a quarter, getting scrubbed, soaked, massaged, pumiced, moisturized, polished and relaxing. It was heavenly and such a perfect gift for me. I had done my own toenails just before leaving home but after all the walking and the poor job I did myself, it was a treat to have them looking so good again. </p>
<p>Akane's mom had pale pink polish on her nails and a tiny flower on one of them, a Mother's Day promotion. She was very pleased with them; they looked very nice, and my guess is she will be doing this again. She and Akane were chatting, waiting for me, and Riku had fallen asleep in his stroller just ten minutes earlier, after a stop at a fruit booth for fresh fruit and drinks. </p>
<p>Mrs. Goda had made arrangements not to go to the reunion meeting, so planned so spend some time with us. Off we went for lunch, at a little spot that specializes in tempura. It looked very familiar to me, and I told Akane I was sure we had been there last trip and sat at a corner table. She assured me I was correct; Bryn and Ayako had been with us too, before Riku was born, </p>
<p>I had the luncheon special, along with her mom and herself, but they substituted broccoli for the shrimp for me. Riku lay sleeping beside me in his stroller, needing to be soothed just twice over the next two busy hours. </p>
<p>We caught a train to Namba, a very popular and busy shopping area in Osaka. Akane and her mom are shoppers and like to browse. This was fine with me as I wanted Riku to be moving and sleeping as long as possible. At one point they were admiring, as was I, some small and lovely leather handbags with the extra attraction of being made in such a way that they go from being a shoulder bag to fastening around the waist... a high class version of a fanny pack. They were discussing colours and I was soothing Riku as he stirred a bit; Mrs. Goda showed me a turquoise blue bag, and I agreed that it was lovely. Akane told me that she was meaning for me to have one! and did I like this colour! They were quite expensive and I tried to say it wasn't at all necessary for her to buy one for me, but we all three ended up with one.... Akane and I both have black ones and Mrs. Goda a beige one. I felt quite guilty about it, as I had also tried to buy our lunch and Akane told me it was fine, that her mother was happy to pay for it. I am now the proud owner of a very gorgeous little bag that I would have loved but would never have bought for myself! Lucky me! </p>
<p>Riku woke up and needed to be fed, so we went off to a tea shop, set in the middle of one of the floors of this elegant store. Akane ordered Assam tea for us, Mrs. Goda had green tea, and we all chose a dessert. Mine was a plain cheesecake, Akane's a mocha cake I believe, and Mrs. Goda had a cake with cherries baked into it. While we were waiting for it, I fed Riku a good sized portion of oatmeal and strawberries I had brought with me. Apparently my cheesecake was very good as he ate all but two tiny bites of it, and many bites of his baa-baa's (as Bryn has told me it should be spelled). </p>
<p>Mrs. Goda left us after tea, to catch a bus to visit her mom in another area of Osaka. Akane wanted to look for some comfortable skirts with elastic waistbands at their favourite clothing store, Muji. The minute we stepped inside Riku asked "Where the blocks?" Akane was amazed as he was there just once with Bryn a while back and obviously remembered just from stepping in the store that this was the place with blocks! We went downstairs immediately to that area (well, I stopped for a few moments to see if I could find a pair of cotton pj's for myself... no luck) and while Akane poked around and took her time looking for some clothes, Riku and I sat on the mat while he built to his heart's content. There were two trays of letters and plain blocks.... Japanese and English and also some wooden "food" with velcro along with a wooden knife. That was being used constantly by other children but as soon as he could Riku got his hands on that.   </p>
<p>Little note here: while changing Riku in the large and very efficient children's changing room (padded and separated changing sections, a sink for washing hands and one for cleaning bottoms, waste baskets, and diapers and juice for sale... really wonderfully thought out) Riku noticed a bruise on his knee. "What's this?" he asked. It was where the child had kicked him yesterday, a three sectioned bruise just to the side of his knee. No wonder he cried so hard; it wasn't just hurt feelings. It is still being discussed a day later. </p>
<p>Another note: in most public bathrooms in the bigger stores there are choices of "western style" toilets and "Japanese style", Since a always wear pants it is much more efficient to use the western style, but the other day I didn't want to wait and used the Japanese toilet. It is a bit of a challenge to stoop while holding aside the fabric of the pants but I thought at the time that it wasn't very efficient to have the paper behind one! I thought to take the paper first, smart girl that I am. Today I also didn't want to wait for the one western style stall, so went in to the other... and realized that I had sat on the other backwards the other day! The raised "back" of it was really the front and there was the paper, just where it should be! Akane laughed when I told her! Ah well, one lives and one learns. I did think though Gail that if you ever used one you might never get up again! It's very low and not easy but I guess in time I would have great leg muscles. I do wonder how some of these very frail, thin, and elderly women manage though.</p>
<p>Akane lucked out with the clothes, finding a nice skirt, extra tights, and some cute three-quarter length pants for Riku, in a navy and white stripe.  It was time to head for home, but after walking to the underground found out there had been an accident so had a long walk back to the train station. Along the way, we passed three huge aquariums with darting goldfish, blue and red fish and some black and white ones. Riku was of course very interested in them; I stopped often, showing him things that would interest him, as he did have to stay in the stroller and had been in it for a long time already. He had some meandering time in the stores though, and a couple of salesclerks, who stopped him to chat, exclaimed how much like me he looked! Akane and I agreed later that it isn't that he looks so much like me but that he doesn't look fully Japanese, so the Causacian features are mine. He does attract lots of attention here though although I think a good part of it is that he is so open and friendly to everyone. Most younger children here are quite shy and so he stands out from the crowd. And of course he is gorgeous... there is that! </p>
<p>Riku had snacks on the train, and once home he gobbled up those cherry tomatoes again while his dinner was being put on the table. He ate one piece of "ebi", the tempura shrimp Akane brought home, I made him scrambled eggs with cheese melted in it, he had some walnut and raisin bread that Akane had picked up for me (delicious and I think not white flour... we did look for some whole grain bread while we were out and found one short loaf of half-grain for 50 cents a slice), and then ate strawberries, apple slices, and a banana for dessert. </p>
<p>It was too late to go out to the park, as had been my intention. Riku didn't have any outside time today for the first time since I arrived. He was outside of course, during our walking around, but he didn't have any running time. He was a busy but tired fellow after dinner; I decided to give him a sink bath as I had forgotten to press the button to heat the tub water and twenty minutes was too late to wait. However, Akane, who went to rescue a plastic duck from the tub for us, assured me that the tub water had maintained its temperature (it has three heavy duty covers over it) and so in he went. I took some photos of this happy boy; he really enjoys the water and it obviously relaxes him before bedtime. </p>
<p>I read him "Small Pig", of course! and also "Franklin's Pet Problem" before bedtime tonight; at one point in the book Franklin is trying to decide what pet he should get. One of his friends suggests a goldfish; I pointed to the fish and (thinking of the aqarium today) asked if he remembered what this fish was called. He wrinkled up his forehead, thought about it and said solemnly "goldfish... yum, yum!" I guess those fish tanks just made him think of dinner! </p>
<p>He was tucked in by his mom at 8:30 p.m., back out fifteen minutes later with what Akane thought was a BM,,,, but a false alarm it was, and back they went to her room. I blogged and blogged, answered a few emails while Akane watched tv, giving over her computer to me for as long as I needed it. At some point though Bryn came in to chat on IM, I went back to the blogs, and both Akane and me ended up going to bed far too late... 12:15 a.m.! Akane has mostly been going to bed with Riku or at 10:30 or so, so this was a late night for both of us. I think I read for three minutes and was sound asleep. </p>
<p>This was a wonderful day; we were all outside during a sunny day, the three moms here celebrated together, and just before I turned off the computer there was a lovely email from Kelly, wishing me a Happy Mother's day, thanking me for helping make her the mom she is. There is nothing she could have said that could have made me happier.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/early_edition_extra_extra_read.html">Early Edition... Extra, Extra, Read All About It!</a></h2>
								<p>Okay, my blogs are already too long and yet there are often extra little things I would like to say; I make notes during the day of fun things that Riku is doing and so have decided that I will just add this little blog in between days... </p>
<p>...Riku and Akane were playing on the bed the other day; they were rolling about, or rather Riku was rolling about Akane, and she trapped him up by her neck. I was busy in the kitchen and heard a loud voice calling out "Nana, come look!"... and look I did, several times over the next ten minutes, at his command! </p>
<p>...Riku was busy in his kitchen making us food, and when it was ready he called out "lunch time!"</p>
<p>... A few days ago, after his lunch and some play time, I asked him if he knew what time it was. He answered with that head lowered, but those eyes looking up at me "Tuck in time?" He has also said "Nap time?" and "Bedtime?". Nice that he knows the routine! </p>
<p>... a first time for this too... "I'm hungry!" ... just before lunch was served. </p>
<p>... after we got home from the Goda's yesterday, Riku wrapped both the zebra and his dog (from my house) up in separate blankets, carrying them around lovingly, giving them kisses, talking to them with a little lilt in his voice... so very sweet. </p>
<p>... Riku is repeating every single thing he hears now; he says "good heavens", "oh my goodness!", "this is delicious!", and so many other things that I can't remember. I really must start writing them down, as he says them so clearly and accurately.  </p>
<p>... He also retells stories very well. Today, while Riku and I were in the lobby, I heard a child crying quite loudly; since he sounded so upset, I thought I would check it out. Turned out that he had somehow gotten locked behind an exit door, so of course I pushed open the door to find a sobbing seven-year-old boy. Riku related the story to me while waiting for the elevator and while in the elevator, and to his mom when we got upstairs. "Boy crying. Nana open door. Door locked. Boy crying. Boy get out"... all said with a worried look on his face. </p>
<p>... and one last one for tonight. Riku does not like it if he thinks I am not pleased with him. Tonight he threw an apple slice on the floor and I told him I was not happy with him. He called to me (I was in the kitchen) and when I looked at him he said "Nana happy?", with a big grin on his face so that I would smile back at him... and when I do, he says "Nana happy." The other day I told him I was cross with him, as he threw a stone into a fountain he had been told not to... and he said "Nana not cross; Nana happy!"</p>
<p>I really am off to bed, it's 11:10, but I just remembered this as well... </p>
<p>... last night before Riku's bedtime we heard a lot of sirens; they were constant for more than ten minutes and I decided I would take Riku outside on the balcony, to see if we could see them. Well, that was just the best thing to do as he was amazed at all the lights, the signs, the flashing neon lights, the traffic headlights, the train going under the road, all the trucks... all of it... and yes, we saw several fire trucks and police cars too, for a long stretch along the highway. I took him outside this morning today; we both reached our hands out to feel the rain, but once again Riku was delighted with the sight of... cranes, men unloading wood in a new "bulding" across the highway, smoke on the left of us, and "dirty smoke" to the right, mountains to the side and across from us, cars, garages, and the sounds of "men working"... "what is that?". Really, it was like a Richard Scarry book come to life... trains going under bridges, big buses, huge trucks, lots of action and movement. We spent quite a few minutes out there checking it all out; it's quite a view from up here on the 29th floor!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/a_very_long_day.html">A Very Long Day</a></h2>
								<p>... started at 5:15 a.m. today! Not sure what woke Riku up but he burst into my room at this ungodly hour and I am on my way to bed for 10 p.m. tonight. At 6:15 it was obvious he really needed to nap; he had his usual breakfast, played a bit and then I took him into my room to lie down. He wasn't happy about it, but was sound asleep in just ten minutes, tucked into my bed with the air conditioner going, just to block out street noise. </p>
<p>I went in to shower, fulling intending to be on the listen for his sensitive forty-minute disturbance time, but missed it by ten minutes. However, Akane said, after she emerged from her room a half hour later, that he had come out of my room, said he wanted to go to bed, and off they went! He only slept an hour and a half, but it was long enough to get him through the rest of the morning and lunchtime. During his nap, I managed to get that last unwritten blog done too, so that will make my nights less long. </p>
<p>No drawing at the table for him during the day today... unusual, but we did read stories, and he kept busy with his cars and buses and trains instead. Snack time after his nap: blueberries, a banana half, and a half slice of raisin toast. We're almost out of the whole wheat raisin bread, which is too bad as it is not available here. </p>
<p>Riku and I went off to the park at 11 a.m. (after sitting on the toilet for a few minutes first), and were out until 12:30. It was a lovely day, bright and sunny, although with a bit of a wind in the morning. He ran up the hills, collected a brand new crop of rocks, but today there were a few children in the park and he had such a good time with them. One of the children had stickers that he shared, so there were four children with stickers on their arms and cheeks and, in Riku's case, his neck too. He and a little girl played among the few trees, collecting sticks and stones and putting them in a pile. Riku found a circular disc somewhat above ground and decided to try to balance on one foot, which he did! ... and with his foot quite high in the air. Two little girls and a boy were hanging on to a rod and lifting their legs off the ground, and even though I didn't manage to get a photo of him doing this, he was successful at it too, much to my surprise. Once the other children left it was easy to convince Riku it was time to go home for lunch. </p>
<p>Akane had almost finished preparing him whole wheat pasta, fresh tomatoes with some tomato sauce, finely chopped carrots, spinach, and mushrooms. He was really hungry when he walked in, despite his good morning snack; this boy is packing in the food and gaining weight! I washed a few cherry tomatoes for him, and by the time he was asking for more his lunch was ready. He now blows on his food in little puffs and then eats it even when it is still quite hot. He ate all but one bite of a good-sized bowl of it, then had some strawberries, and white raisin roll from the bakery yesterday. </p>
<p>At 1:30 he was sound asleep with his mom. She came out about forty five minutes later, and Riku slept over two and a half hours! He was still white and listless when he came out of the room, and snuggled up on my lap while we discussed going to the playground and what his snack would be. I made up a little plate of two tiny filled Japanese children's cookies, a few sliced strawberries, two big grapes in sections, and four small sticks of gouda cheese. </p>
<p>We were at the playground downstairs at 4:45, the latest ever, and the two "regular" moms were there, plus a few other older children on their own. Riku was a little quieter today (that short night took its toll), but he had a good time, rode a little push car around for a bit, collected small sticks with some of the older girls helping him, and finally got his hands on the bat and ball, much to his delight. A dad came out to play catch with his son, and Riku went over with the ball, handed it to the dad, who threw it to Riku. He had the bat extended and it looked for a moment as though he really knew what he was doing! </p>
<p>A funny thing happened with me while there. The first woman I ever met there has a daughter about six years old, and a son just two years old. I was sitting on the bench watching the children, and the little guy came over to me, extended his hands and put them on either side of my face, grinning at me. It made the other moms there, and his too, laugh, but he must have done it about twenty times! I started doing it to him too but he just wanted to touch my face and squeeze it a little. His mom finally came over and distracted him but it took a few tries. Have no idea what was going on there but it was amusing. </p>
<p>I know the older children are quite intrigued by me; they often come over and try to talk to me, or stand a little bit away just staring until another child chats me up, and then they too come closer. They are very sweet and repeat words that I say to Riku... 'ball', or "come back", or "careful" and do so very well. Tonight, two girls about six years old, possibly twins, came over to show us a small plastic box with flowers and a butterfly in it, while the second child gave Riku a good sized chunk of white bun with raisins, which he was happy to accept. </p>
<p>I had asked Akane to bathe and join us in the playground, as she hadn't been out today, and at 5:45 she did so, wearing her new white skirt. We went to the bakery and bought a few goodies: a rectangle of hash brown potato for me, some nice black sesame, maybe oats, and whole grain bread as well, and Akane picked up a few of her and Riku's favourites too. Akane asked, on my behalf, if the baker (a young fellow who was there when I visited two and a half years ago) would do a whole wheat loaf. She wasn't sure if it is going to be all whole wheat, but he said it would be ready after 10 a.m. tomorrow. </p>
<p>Akane had a hankering for a Mos (a local burger chain) shrimp burger so we walked across the bridge near the train station for her take out order. Poor Riku was not happy to learn we weren't going on a train. He burst into tears when he found out we were going home; he was also ready to cry when he thought we were heading right home after the playground (Oh! To bakery? Not home. Okay!). This is a sure sign that he is a very tired fellow. </p>
<p>He and I came right up to the apartment so he could have dinner asap. Tonight was the second time he has said "I'm hungry", and I'm so glad he is now able to say this. I told Akane tonight at the table that he used to say "yogurt" with a whine in his voice when he was hungry before, and although he still says that, he can also be more clear about his needs. </p>
<p>And a hungry boy he was! I quickly made him a very spinach-y omelette with cheese. I was sure he was going to balk at the bright green bits sticking out all over, but he ate all but one bite on his own, using his fork so well. I also made a small bowl of four-grain hot cereal for him; he ate all of the berries and all but a few spoonfuls of the cereal, then asked for a banana. That is quite a round tummy on this boy right now!</p>
<p>I popped him into the sink for a quick wash, and then into the soaking tub for some relaxing water playtime. I noticed tonight that the water comes up to only his belly button, not to his arm pits. The water was cooler tonight and I asked him if it was too cold or if it was alright. He thought about it while dangling his feet in the water and then said seriously, "It's alright". I do this a lot with him now... "Would you like something else to eat or are you alright?" or "Okay". He always lets me know after thinking about it for a few seconds... "I'm okay" or "I hungry". "Would you like more dinner or are you ready for dessert?" Hmm, he's "ready for dessert" almost always.</p>
<p>I told him he could draw a little bit after his tub, so he did that but said when he sat down, "I'm hungry"! I asked if he wanted cereal or toast and he decided on toast, so a half slice of toasted whole wheat toast with butter was consumed during his drawing session. Tonight I had to draw his daddy, his mommy, his friend Alex, and his Grandpa.</p>
<p>On the way into the building tonight this tired little boy said, "Where's Daddy?" I hope it's not too long before they are together again. I know he must miss him. He often rolls his eyes around at me, pretending not to notice me, and then says, "Daddy do that to Riku". His daddy is going to see huge changes in him! </p>
<p>At 10 p.m., after being in the bedroom for almost an hour, Riku was out here with a dirty diaper. Akane said he was almost asleep but with all that food in him today, I'm not surprised that he needed some relief! I hope that Akane is tucked in for the night, as I am heading off to bed myself. Five and a half hours sleep is absolutely not enough for me! </p>
<p>p.s. I am trying in many different ways to make Riku more independent. He is becoming more and more comfortable at sitting on the toilet, and for a longer period of time. One day soon we hope for more than just a chat session but for now we are very pleased that he is willing to sit there. He is struggling to take off most of his clothes now, although tiny buttons are far beyond him just yet. However, he now takes off his own pants, gets most of his shirts off, takes down his own diaper and throws the wet ones in the garbage, knows how to do up the velcro straps on his sandals and figured out, with just a little help from his Nana, that he can use the edge of a ledge to pull against to take them off. Yesterday I taught him which two pieces of his shoelaces to pull to undo them... and how to loosen them up to take them off... he's working hard on these things, and doesn't want anyone else to do them for him. What a guy! </p>
<p>Good night... I'm washed out and ready to tuck in at 10:20... I'll be asleep at 10:30, no doubt!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/a_redbanner_day.html">A Red-Banner Day!</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke this morning at 5:45 after hearing Riku, but it was after a wonderful seven hour sleep! Riku went back to bed for an hour but I didn't. It was a great chance to catch up on some emails, sorely neglected since working on my blog entries. </p>
<p>I promised Riku while he was eating his breakfast that we would go out for a walk; I knew he would need a nap, and have learned that the earlier the morning nap is, the better, so the afternoon nap isn't so late. Akane had prepared a cup of hot chocolate for me; I had some seeded bread, toasted, with peanut butter for my breakfast and we were out the door at 8:30 a.m. Riku told me "something in shoe" (which was sand, it turned out) but it gave me the perfect opportunity to put him in his stroller; he was asleep at 9 a.m. </p>
<p>I had quite the adventure as I walked for over two and a half hours! I walked to Diamond City (Akane was quite impressed when I told her this) and was doing well, until I headed back and decided to take a quiet laneway instead of staying on the main roads. The two towers that make up our "home base" are very visable for a huge distance, but it turns out not from some of the more crowded areas of the city. I walked down tiny laneways that had no exit, went through a complex that was surrounded by walls, but that looked promising from each end, and lost sight of the towers several times! However, it was fine; Riku napped for only forty minutes and was awakened by a very loud "talking" truck parked at a busy intersection. We had to wait there too long to avoid his hearing it, but he did doze, relax, and snack the rest of the journey. </p>
<p>Twice I stopped and asked "Sakai-chi?" and was told the right direction but that was still before the towers were always visible. What fun the directionally handicapped have! Finally, we were headed  in the right direction, with the towers where I couldn't miss them, and we arrived safe and sound, if with tired feet, at the park. </p>
<p>Riku was very happy to get out and run around, go up the hill collecting rocks (of course!), chatting at some length with a woman about her dog. At least that is what I assume they were talking about. It was all in Japanese and involved lots of kneeling down, patting, and smiling. At one point Riku pointed at me and said "Nana" so she may have been asking who I was. Oh, one thing that Riku did with total confidence today, with no hesitation, was to go over to a parallel bar, hang on tightly and swing his legs way up. He tried this a few times yesterday but today obviously decided he was an old hand at it. He demonstrated for me, and then went on to other more important activities. Just as we were leaving the park, Riku walked between two large supports, as he always does. One would have to be that small to do this, but today I was ahead of him and he called out "Nana, watch this!". I turned to see him with his body pressed between the two supports, basically wedging him in, with his feet up off the ground so he was supported by just his shoulders! It was hilarious and he stayed there, obviously quite comfortably while I stopped to get my camera out to take his photo. What fun this was to see; I can't wait to get the photos up online. </p>
<p>On our way to the park, just as we approached it, we passed a young woman from the park yesterday. She was there with her one-year-old daughter, who was just learning to walk. The little girl was smiling away at me and I was cheering her on with her practicing. So, when we met up today, the mom bowed to me and I bowed back. How lovely to be running into familiar faces! And to top it off, when we were walking through the building on our way upstairs, we passed the first mom we met in the playground here; we stopped to say "ohayo" to one another and to say hello to the children. </p>
<p>After an hour and a half of being very busy and on the go at the park, I knew that Riku would be hungry, despite his snack of half a banana, a package of new cookies Akane bought for him yesterday (brown rice biscuits that taste and smell very healthy; he liked them), and a little container of dried apricots and blueberries. His mommy had his lunch all ready for him when we walked in the door... a nice-sized bowl of rice (he and I had chatted about his having some rice for lunch today, so that was perfect), with fine strips of carrot, some spinach (we are making good use of the veggie box from Akane's aunts), little cubes of leftover tempura sweet potato, and fresh tomato. He ate all but two bites of it. </p>
<p>I so enjoy our little conversations about meals: me, after Riku pushes away his bowl, "All done or do you want more"  Riku: "all done" or "I okay". Me: "Ready for dessert?" Riku: "OK" Me: "Would you like strawberries?" Riku, big smile: "OK" Me: ... or an orange?" Riku pondering... and then: "an orange".  He will often make the big "ummmm" sound as he thinks about his choices. </p>
<p>Immediately after lunch I asked Riku if he knew what time it was, and his prompt answer was "bedtime". I told Akane yesterday about Kelly and Bryn just heading up the stairs automatically after lunch for their nap, singing "Up the stairs and into bed, Kelly Lynne. Up the stairs and into bed, Johnny Bryn (this made Akane laugh), up the stairs and into bed, you'll never get up you sleepy heads (not very reassuring, is it?), up the stairs and into bed" . I should really start singing this to Riku as Johnny Riku would work and is correct. Perhaps his dad and Auntie Kelly could come up with a verse that doesn't involve the going upstairs part, as he never goes up to bed! </p>
<p>So, diaper change, sit on the toilet for a minute, and into bed with his mommy for almost two hours. Akane appeared after an hour and had some time on the computer while I ate my boiled potato and hard-boiled-egg hot lunch, a favourite of mine and Gail's... with butter and pepper of course! I also made a nice big bowl of lightly sauteed spinach with butter and pepper to eat while the potatoes cooked. Delicious! </p>
<p>I chatted with Bryn on IM for a bit after answering a couple of emails; Riku and his mom were building some blocks, and then Riku and I got ready for his daily trek to the playground. I'm sure by now you all are very familiar with our routine! Ah, forgot the snack time... four sticks of Ontario cheddar that I brought here with me, a few nice big grapes, quartered, and a few thin sections of apple slices. </p>
<p>Riku has the sniffles, so Akane put an extra shirt on him before we left; good thing too, as it was much cooler and I put on his light jacket as well. The usual crew were down in the playground; Riku found a ball and was like a puppy, wanting anyone at all to play with him. At one point a fellow about twenty years old came out of one of the buildings with his mother. Riku waited until he was just past him and then threw the ball in that direction. Of course the man saw it, picked it up, and rolled it back to Riku. Well, wasn't Riku just so pleased with this! He got another two throws in before I rescued the man, by now almost at the end of the area. I often kick the ball around with him, but he really prefers to interact with the other children, or at least a new fan.</p>
<p>Akane joined us about 4:45 after she had been to the store for eggs and water: we get one free container a day, and usually go through it. The children all left early today, and since it was a bit chilly we decided to leave too; Akane wanted some Kentucky Fried Chicken; Riku wasn't ready to go home yet... as we turned the corner he said "no go home yet?" and when I told him we were going to the restaurant he said "OK, we go home later, we go to 'tore now". He and I sat and chatted at a round table with a square in the middle... one topic of conversation, after which we piled our hands on top of each other and pulled out the bottom one, something we haven't done in a while. </p>
<p>Home for dinner. Riku had some tomatoes, a bite of his mom's chicken, and some toast and butter; he wasn't terribly hungry right then, so he drew for a bit, played for a while, rode his bike around, and then asked if he could watch TV. He is probably feeling a little under the weather as his nose is slightly runny and he is sneezing. He didn't watch any yesterday or today, so Akane put on a children's tape of one of his favourite Japanese characters. I made him some oatmeal and sat beside him watching with him while I fed him. We watched two fifteen minute segments and then it was time for a hair wash at the kitchen sink. </p>
<p>Riku is getting better and better at taking off his own clothes and did so again tonight, tugging away at his pants, figuring out how to hook his fingers at the back to pull them down, and then his diaper, which went right into the garbage can in the kitchen. And then it was time to sit on the toilet... and he URINATED IN THE TOILET! He was ever so pleased with himself! I called to Akane to come and see and it lasted long enough that she too got to stand and clap and make a big fuss. Riku was just beaming away at us: I told him tomorrow we are going to go downstairs and buy him a present. I plan to buy several little cars/trains/planes to reward this behaviour, just as I did for his daddy all those many years ago. We did our usual wash/bath routine, although tonight the little duck was going to the bathroom, having BMs, and "duck sitting on toilet"... a little pail he has in the tub. </p>
<p>Oh yes, we are at a new phase indeed. He is determined to take off his own socks, really struggling to get the socks over his heels on his own, and he must be the one who turns the light on in the bathroom, opens the door, and does the reverse when he leaves. He also got to flush the toilet tonight, which he doesn't do if he doesn't "produce".</p>
<p>Akane tucked him in at 8:30 and he was asleep by 8:50. Hope he sleeps well, and that the stuffy nose is gone by tomorrow. </p>
<p>Meant to mention last night that I saw an interesting slogan on a six-year-old girl's t-shirt at the park yesterday "wee aged saucy girl"... whatever that means! and was quite taken aback by one worn by a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old on our walk this morning; it made me glad that Riku couldn't read... fill in the blanks, although I didn't have to... **** you, you ****ing ****er  ****!  Quite the statement, and I'm sure her parents have been told it means something quite different!</p>
<p>Took some interesting photos today... some of the narrow lanes I found myself in, more futons hanging on balconies, and a couple of vending machine contents. Fun to be walking along and having all these new experiences.</p>
<p>I'm off to bed... twenty minutes late, so let's hope that Riku sleeps in until 5:45 a.m. tomorrow! I can deal with my long busy days quite nicely with seven hours sleep but not any less!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/such_a_pretty_boy.html">Such a Pretty Boy</a></h2>
								<p>Riku awoke at 5:30 this morning, too early at any time but especially when his cold is worse and he could have used the sleep. So could his mom; Akane said he was awake several times in the night with his stuffy nose; poor wee guy, which meant that she was awake too. Now she has his cold and is feeling tough herself. </p>
<p>I must have dozed off for another half hour after hearing him and then got up to see how he was doing. He still wanted his yogurt, but didn't finish it all at one sitting as usual, though he did finish it and a banana a little later on. </p>
<p>He and I were out the door at 9:20 a.m. for what I hoped would be a long nap. Riku wanted to walk first, though, and so he did, for half an hour. We had only just crossed the road from the apartment building and started walking, when three Japanese people, a man in his mid-forties and two young women in their twenties, walked right up to Riku and started chatting to him, and to me. They thought he was the cutest child they had seen... no, they thought he was the prettiest child they had seen! They got right down to his level, asked him his name, wanted to know how old he was, where we were from, and were just so sweet with both of us. What a lovely encounter! They were still waving goodbye half way down the street with Riku waving back assuring them "see you later!"</p>
<p>We just strolled on our way down a quiet side street, with Riku finding the odd not-to-be-passed-by rock, and sticking his head into doorways in case there was something to see. A half hour later he raised his arms up, into the stroller he went, and in less than five minutes he was asleep. </p>
<p>I had decided to walk back to where we were yesterday, as Akane had told me about a wonderful German toy department, with toys out for the children to play with as well. It was in this very same place we passed yesterday; Akane had said we would go there by bus one day so this worked out well. We had a destination in mind for today then, unusual for me as I generally just walk, trying to keep those twin towers within sight. </p>
<p>However, before going to the store (and with Riku still sleeping) I got side-tracked by a hair salon I had noticed yesterday. My hair has been terrible since arriving; it wasn't cut well or short enough on my last cut in SF, and with the heat and high humidity here, no matter how I dry it or which products I use, it has been frizzy and not easy to deal with. This particular place seemed to have fairly young stylists which I thought was good as they may have been more recently trained and possibly would have worked on Caucasion hair too. Akane had suggested last week that I ask a Caucasion woman where she went, but I have only seen two this whole trip and they were both in Osaka. </p>
<p>Riku slept off in a quiet corner for another forty minutes and I had my hair washed and my haircut almost finished when he woke. At this point I was quite happy with my hair; he had cut it the length I wanted but then kept working away at it with various types of scissors. At this point it was too late to holler "enough!" as he obviously had to finish what he had started.... but it did seem to go on and on. I was afraid I was going to end up with some of those long thin strands hanging on my neck, but that didn't happen, thank goodness. Bottom line is my hair is much shorter than I wanted it to be. This length does not suit me, but I know I shall be grateful while I'm here that at least it is a good cut and was well done. I would rather it not have been this short for Taryn's wedding but it will grow a bit in the next two weeks and two days! </p>
<p>The best part of it all (aside from the little back massage I received at the end of the cut), was the attention that Riku received from the one female staff member, and one male to a lesser extent as well. I got up to give Riku his water, and then this very friendly gal spent the rest of my hair hair cut time down on her haunches playing with Riku, and with the cars and some plastic people figures. He was in his glory, chatting away in Japanese to her and smiling that Riku smile at her. The fellow who cut my hair spoke a bit of English and said to me "He is very pretty". I agreed and said that he was a boy, just in case he thought Riku was a girl, but he nodded yes, and said that girls were pretty, but this boy was also very pretty and had beautiful eyes. It's hard to disagree! </p>
<p>The toy department in one of the big stores in this complex (I'm going back one day!) was a child's wonderland! They had so many toys out for the children to play with... a huge wooden climbing structure, with a slide, and lots of peekholes, a big table of water toys with bridges and boats (but no water), a big wooden structure filled with wooden balls (not as much fun as plastic ones though, I bet, as they would hurt if anyone got rambunctious!), a table with a wooden spiral and marbles to spin on down from the top (Riku really liked this one), a wooden doll house that also caught his attention, and a table at the back with building units... blocks, pieces that snapped together, etc. Riku was a happy boy wandering around and I had to promise that we would go back another day. We had to be back in time for his lunch at 12:30 as he had eaten such an early breakfast. Snacks are fine and he nibbled on some toast and the rice biscuits, but I knew he would be ready for his proper lunch. </p>
<p>It was only a thirty minute walk, with an extra five minutes thrown in to find my way around the train tracks. Akane wasn't feeling well, so hadn't prepared his lunch yet; he immediately asked for yogurt! ... his way of saying he wants food <strong>now</strong>. I put out some cherry tomatoes, and in less than five minutes Akane had an egg and spinach dish ready for him. He ate all but one bite, had a big bowl of strawberries, some of the vegetable drink, and all was well with his world. </p>
<p>Nap time with his mommy followed immediately; he does try to play a bit but it was already 1:30 and time for that nap. They both slept for two hours which was great; I had time for a quiet lunch (pepper "chicken" pieces I had brought from home, some rice mixed with whole grains (which Akane's dad is now using to help control his diabetes; Akane bought some to try here and we all like it), and a nice big serving of quickly cooked spinach thrown on top of it all. Yum! Fast and delicious, and good for me too. A cup of nice hot milky tea followed, while I read yet another of the New Yorker fiction pieces I had pulled out to read "one day" and now those days are here. It's very handy as I brought fewer books with me on this trip, and can leave the best of the fiction here for Bryn to read later. Akane has read a couple of them as well. </p>
<p>By this time I was feeling mighty dozy, and if I had been a napper I would have been asleep in minutes; it was awfully tempting, and was yesterday too, but I know if Riku had awakened in ten minutes I would have felt worse for the bit of sleep; I also know, from the few times I have tried napping, that I never feel better. Give me seven or eight hours... not one! </p>
<p>I just had to move and managed to get a few emails read and written before a little boy peeked in to see what I was doing. The nose was dripping and he was pretty warm too; not a high fever but not normal either... the ears weren't red, and the cheeks weren't either but his forehead was warm as were his chest and legs. I asked if he wanted to go to the park (no playground with all the other children with this nose running) and much to my surprise he said "no", in a wan little voice. "TV?" Sure... he just needs some quiet sit down time, with his mom on one chair and me on the other side of him, exclaiming over the antics of the characters of the show we saw yesterday. This fifteen-minute piece was followed by another show with very charming young twenty-something hosts... very cute, very talented, and with lots of fun animation, skits, and songs involving very young children... two and up. We all enjoyed this time and Riku snacked on fresh oranges, some cashews, and toast while he watched it.</p>
<p>As soon as that show was over, I asked again if he wanted to go to the park for some fresh air... Akane too. She hasn't felt well all day but I thought getting out couldn't make her feel any worse. So off we all went, just strolling around the park, with Riku collecting... rocks! and finding interesting places to put them. Today he discovered a little hole and that took up twenty minutes of finding rocks the right size to put in it. Life is busy when you're two! </p>
<p>I meant to mention this the other day, but Riku for some reason will not go down the slide here. He did the first three days, I believe, and then just refused. He climbs up, stands in the middle part for a few minutes and then starts the climb down. There isn't a lot of room up there, and it's quite steep so I make sure I am very close by... right at the bottom of the slide with one foot up and braced! He has a little trouble turning around in that space and so is tempted to come down face front, but that would just be too dangerous. He has it down pat now; it takes some maneuvering but he does it, and then climbs down saying this mantra, over and over "It's okay, don't worry"... another step, finding new places for his hands and "It's okay, don't worry" once again. It is the funniest thing to hear and I'm sure it is exactly what I said to him the first few times he climbed down. </p>
<p>Akane hasn't been over here with Riku, and so he got to demonstrate how he can lift his feet off the ground while hanging from the parallel bar. He really hung on tonight and swung back and forth three times, his best effort yet! He realized today that he could do a mini version of this just outside the apartment door while waiting for us, but it's really such a short little bar that he doesn't get much lift. </p>
<p>Akane's tummy was upset, so she went off to the store to buy a rice bowl, and when she came back got to see Riku climbing up the slide faster than he ever has! Two children were playing on it and really moving and I guess he figured if that was how it was done then he had better get moving, and move he did... it was almost scary, although he is a cautious boy, thank goodness, for my sake! </p>
<p>Riku spotted his mom's food and helped her out with it; it was rice wrapped around salmon bits, and then wrapped in seaweed. He polished off the rest of it while we admired the roses; nice to see that his appetite is still healthy! </p>
<p>Home at 6:30 after stopping at the bakery; Akane bought some pizza for herself, a white bun with Camembert cheese baked in it for me, and a Danish roll for Riku. We knew he was hungry when he went back for the fourth free sample of bread cubes! At home he ate a bowl of porridge with cranberries, blueberries, flax, and wheat germ. Finished every bite of it, and said "yes, please", he would like some "ice cream" but it was really sorbet... two helpings of that! And all the while his nose was running and his eyes look tired... poor little baboo. </p>
<p>Tub time, and lots of fun there, as we had a little frog hand cloth gobbling up hair bands and having BMs in the pails and in the water. Oh my! He really loves his bath, and he needed to relax and be ready for sleep, which he was at 8:30 tonight. I know his mommy would have liked me to tuck him in tonight, but Riku will have nothing of this at all. "Mommy tuck in, okay?" and when I assure him that yes, his mommy will tuck him in, he says "okay, mommy tuck in... night night, see you in the morning!" and off they went. </p>
<p>And I'm off to bed too... I really love being in bed by 10 p.m. reading and it's not going to happen tonight. I am, however, washed with teeth brushed so that is a bonus. I just have to do up the dinner dishes... yuck! Have never left them so late. Oh, that reminds me... Riku was playing in his kitchen for a bit tonight and brought over my "dinner" on a plate with a fork. When I told him I was finished and that it had been delicious, he took it away and said "Now I have to wash dishes in sink" and he did... put the plate and fork in his own little sink, pretended to turn on the water tap making the whooshing sound, and washed away. It was the first time I have seen him do that... very cute. </p>
<p>Must remember to tell you tomorrow about a group of four young children we met on our way to the park tonight... as I really am too tired to write another paragraph! I think the lack of hair has done something to my brain... it's short! Night night... </p>
<p>Hey! I just had a whole conversation in English with Ayako and she understood every word. I told her Akane was sleeping (snore), that she and Riku had colds (snort, sniff), and that yes, she and Akane were going out tomorrow... and she told me in the morning... I told her to call Akane then... not bad! It took a lot more explaining to tell Ayako that Akane was in labour! and that was in person! My Japanese hasn't improved, so it shows you how well Ayako's English has...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/one_dog_and_another_dog_two_do.html">One Dog and Another Dog... Two Dogs!</a></h2>
								<p>I was awakened this morning by a knock on my door, and a big greeting from Riku... "Lunch time, lunch time!"  It wasn't really quite that late; in fact, it was 7 a.m.! He had wakened at 6 a.m. after a very good sleep, said Akane, and I guess he was in the mood for cooking. I had "cake". on one plate, with a fork, "melon" on another, with a spoon, and then a "hot cuppa tea". It was all delicious, of course, and just what I needed to start my day.  My bed looked like a buffet table by the time Riku finsished with all his preparations. </p>
<p>Akane is spending the day with Ayako today; they are meeting here at 11:30, so I decided that Riku and I would head out early so he could nap in his stroller and not with his mom. Not only would it give her some time alone to shower and get ready, but she was doing a load of laundry for me too. It was gray and overcast, so we came back for our raincoats. Good thing, too, as it did strart to sprinkle later on and I used Riku's raincoat as a blanket for his legs and body. </p>
<p>As always, Riku wanted to walk for a while, and so we strolled along, stopping every once in a while for Riku to explore something that had caught his eye. Today I was sitting on a low wall separating a little garden area from the sidewalk. Riku was very intent on watching the top of the wall. I went over to find three tiny ants walking along, being busy. Riku was entranced and pointed to the garden area saying "big one in there!" Not sure what that big something was, but it was gone when I got there. Riku reached out to touch one ant, spinning it around and making it head off in the opposite direction, a second one was sent on to its next life, and the third one happily survived intact! </p>
<p>About ten minutes further along, Riku was ready for another snack, so into the stroller he went, happy with his container of brown rice biscuits, two tiny pretzels, and a few cheddar bunnies. Ten minutes later he was fast asleep. I walked quickly on to Diamond City, the big mall we went to a couple of days ago. I wanted to walk around and check out all the stores and the timing was perfect, as Riku would be asleep for at least an hour. </p>
<p>I headed first for the huge food floor as they are one of the places I most like to wander around in. Usually the entire bottom floor of a department store is a beehive of food activity... food vendors calling out their products, lots of free samples, food being prepared and served up to eat there or take out (before I leave here I will buy some of the most wonderful-looking baked and glazed sweet potatoes), and movies of products being prepared as you move along each section (which means it can be pretty darned loud in there!). </p>
<p>I wanted to buy a rice bowl for Riku and asked a young woman if she could help me; she said she had "no English" but would call her husband who did; he was at the end of a very long aisle and she called him on her cell phone! He was ever so helpful and found the salmon rice bowl for Riku's lunch that I wanted. Normally I would have taken food along with me, but hadn't planned to be there over the lunch hour. Riku was still sleeping so on I went. I was looking for an egg salad sandwich on whole wheat bread, but could only see white at this particular place. I decided to look elsewhere. </p>
<p>On the way out of the store, though, right in the corner, was their French bakery, very common in both Sakai City and Osaka as well... and maybe throughout Japan. I really should have waited to look until after lunch, but instead gave in to my curiousity about various and luscious-looking goodies. I bought a French pastry coronet filled with custard, two mochi balls (they look just like Tim Horton's tidbits) but are filled with various goodies... I bought one custard cream and one cream cheese. And a small "butter bun" had my name on it, and then I felt I should have something a little healthier and bought a walnut and raisin bun made with grainier bread. </p>
<p>Riku woke up in the mall, sat up, pointed upstairs and said "toys up there!" and he was right! "Riku go there?" I told him we would as soon as we ate and being the reasonable child that he is, he said "ok" and we sat to eat. His mom and dad would not have been proud of the way I wrapped the nori sheet around his sticky salmon-filled rice triangle, but it worked and Riku enjoyed it anyway. He ate all of it before we got home but not all in one sitting. Of course I was very hungry by this time, and so started to nibble away at my little bag of goodies. First the custard coronet (Riku helped me with the custard), and then the two mochi balls (I would only buy the custard ones in the future), and then the butter bun. I did have the will power to save the walnut/raisin bun for the trip home! </p>
<p>Riku had a grand time in the playroom. It wasn't busy, and so he had immediate access to all of his favourite things there... the dollhouse and furniture, the board with the marbles spinning down, but mostly the waterworks set, with no water, but endless possibilities with slides, gates, ramps, and a water pump. He wasn't too thrilled when anyone else wanted in on the action. At one point he walked over to the musical instruments next to it and handed one child the drum sticks! </p>
<p>The heavy rain had stopped by the time we left, and much to my surprise Riku did not nap on the way home. I was tired and ready for me tea, so asked Riku if he would like to nap in the stroller or at home. He chose a nap at home. He had dozed a little but still needs more sleep to get him through to the end of his day. I am trying to give Riku lots of choices right now... "Would you like strawberries or grapes?", "Would you like to go down the ramp or the stairs?" (this is particularly helpful when he doesn't want to go back home at all right then!), "Would you like to sleep in Nana's bed or Mommy's bed?", which I asked when we got home. He chose my bed, and I told him that I did not want him to cry, that he was to have a little nap and when he woke up we would go to the park. "OK", he said. And much to my surprise he settled down, with just a bit of head stroking on my part, and was asleep within ten minutes easily. </p>
<p>I so enjoyed my tea... even without a bickie!, and then got to work anwering emails; I am so far behind and don't really expect to catch up. Riku slept for an hour and fifteen minutes, which was perfect, as it was a later than usual afternoon nap. As soon as he woke we sat side by side and watched a little of the "ABC" children's show he likes so much; it is really cute and well done. I prepared dinner for both of us... leftover half a potato for me, cooked up in a scramble with an egg and the spinach we are trying to use up, from Akane's aunts. I also finished up a small bowl of edamame beans, and a few pickled carrots and cucumber from the other night. Riku ate a very good dinner of leftover pasta with veggies, the other half of his banana, and some toast. </p>
<p>We left the house at 6 p.m. to go to the park. At the corner, across from the park, Riku always pushes the button for the walk signal and it plays "When a body meets a body, coming through the rye". I wish I could remember the rest of the words, as Mom used to sing that song! Riku likes me to sing it too, and always says "Oh, singing!" when the music starts. As we reached the middle of the road I noticed a huge full and gorgeous sun just hanging there! I pointed it out to Riku and we stopped on the other side to get a really good look at it. It was beautiful indeed and I hope the photo I took of it turns out. </p>
<p>We were the only ones there, which was perfect; because of his snifflies I didn't want to take him to the playground, where there were bound to be other children running around. He collected rocks and added them to his collection that he keeps there, and at one point a man walked by with his dog. "Oh, a dog!" piped up Riku and then spotted another one on the other side of us, "Oh, and another dog! Two dogs!" </p>
<p>We stayed until it was dark enough that some of the neon lights were coming on, and then went to the grocery store for milk and tofu squares. Much to our surprise, Akane was home! She and Riku were delighted to see each other; Riku did sit down immediately, though, to take off his own shoes and socks and stuff the socks in his shoes the way that Akane tells me Bryn does with Riku's socks! The other night Akane took off one of Riku's shoes without thinking and he was not pleased. She also put away some of his toys last night while he was bathing and he told her, "No put away Riku's toys!" in quite the little tone... she apologized and said he could put away his kitchen things insted. "OK", says Riku, and was pacified. </p>
<p>Ayako had plans to see Masu, so we all sat down at the table together, while Riku drew and had another snack. Seem all he does is eat? Well, he does eat a lot... and stops when he has had enough. He had a few bites of his mom's rice bowl, a bowl of "ice cream"... the cutest little balls of sorbet I have seen, which Akane cuts in halves and puts in a lovely little glass meant for sake. A few strawberries on a side dish and we had a happy boy. He drew for half an hour as well, now telling us what he is drawing as he goes. I spotted a great little drawing which looked just like a perfect fish to me, and asked Riku "What is this?". His answer... "Oh, that is a fish!" and he was as pleased as punch that he had drawn it! </p>
<p>Continuing along with this independent phase, Riku took all of his clothes off by himself, with just a little help with the snug shirt. He would like to undo buttons too, but most of his are pretty tiny, so we will have to find some big buttoned clothing for him! Off came the overalls, then the diaper, and then onto the toilet... and yes, he was once again successful at urinating in the toilet! I just wish the whole process lasted longer as I would love to have a photo of that face all lit up with his pride! It is just adorable, and his mom and I were so happy for him. </p>
<p>Bath time... our usual fun time as Riku loves to find out all the different sounds he can make with his various tub containers. Because he is standing up, he has lots of pushing power, and can get the big basins and the little watering cans filled with water and push them to the bottom. He knows the plastic glass stays down and he then tries to catch it with his foot, and that the watering can will go all the way down and then float up to the top on its own. The big thrill last night was making a big blub blub sound with the glass turned upside down. We were both laughing out loud as each time he did it it was like it was the first time ever. </p>
<p>Riku is always so relaxed and ready for bed after he gets his lotion rubbed on and changed into a diaper and t-shirt for bedtime. I read him "Small Pig" and his mommy took him off to bed at 8:35 p.m., hoping he would be sound asleep by 9 p.m. There was a TV show she wanted to watch then, a competition between the cities of Osaka and Hiroshima, with chefs competing as to who made the best okonomiyaki, a thick pancake-looking dish consisting of egg, green onion, flour, sticky yam, cabbage, kombu, and bonito flakes, with meat or seafood added as well. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Riku didn't sleep, as he had a BM, and was up getting changed at 9 p.m. Akane tried hard to get him to sleep but gave up; I knew how much she wanted to watch the show so I took over and settled him. He was more than ready, and knows that his Nana does not fool around! </p>
<p>I came out and worked on my blog for an hour and a half, only to lose all but the first and last paragraphs of it at 11 p.m.! </p>
<p>Ah yes, the competition... Hiroshima won, much to Akane's chagrin, but it was due to their having access to some very special fish (eel perhaps) that is not available anywhere else. Her cousin had called mid-program, so Akane chatted with her for a while after the show. We both went to bed too late... 11:30 p.m</p>
<p>Some last notes:</p>
<p>...Today Riku stepped into the dining room area, looked at his play area, and announced "These are Riku's toys". </p>
<p>... when I called Riku for his snack yesterday he said "I'm busy working."</p>
<p>... when Akane sneezes, Riku is right there saying "Bless you."</p>
<p>... and yesterday, for the first time, I heard Riku call Akane "Okasa"... "mommy" in Japanese. I had only heard him use the English term, but Akane says he has said it before... just not often. Very sweet.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/friday_already.html">Friday Already!</a></h2>
								<p>Did this week go by quickly! Somehow in my mind it was Wednesday today... funny how that happens. I was awake at 5:30 this morning and in the tatami room writing last night's blog (again), when Riku walked in to say good morning. He was in great spirits and his nose not running a bit; we had a typical morning: getting dressed after sitting on the toilet, breakfast, play time with both Mommy and Nana, some drawing, and then his TV show at 8:30 a.m. </p>
<p>The plan was for Akane and me to be ready to leave for city hall (Akane has to go there before she leaves) in time for Riku's nap around 9:30. When I went in to shower, I suggested to Akane that she make Riku a five-minute boiled egg, as she did one for him last week and he really enjoyed it... sliced in half and sprinkled liberally with pepper! I thought this would hold him during his nap and perhaps a later than usual lunch. Unfortunately, Akane misunderstood me and somehow thought that I wanted her to make him an egg sramble so when I finished showering, there was Riku enjoying every bite of a scrambled egg with lots of spinach in it, plus some fresh tomato pieces! Now that was quite the mid-morning snack! </p>
<p>Akane had been up twice in the night and decided she was too tired to leave so soon; we changed our plans to leave after she and Riku had napped together. </p>
<p>I got back to my blog entry but could hear Riku fooling around... running around the bedroom and being much louder than a child going to sleep should be! An hour later he came out, leaving Akane trying to sleep. He of course was now very tired, but also wired from the running around, so off we went to the park with a few biscuits on hand. </p>
<p>The morning had seemed warm and sunny, and we had the sliding doors open, but when Riku and I went downstairs we realized it was cool and breezy so up we went for our sweater and jacket. Riku was happy to find his little stash of rocks near the slide still in order and got busy adding to it. He and another little fellow played together in the sand box for quite a while, and when he was left with just the mom, he started playing with her, handing her rocks and bit of long grass, as well as engaging her in conversation. It never fails to astound me at just how social he is; everyone is his friend! </p>
<p>He climbed up the slide several times but for the past week or so he has not once slid down; he always backs carefully down the ladder, saying "It's ok, don't worry". I asked him today why he wouldn't slide down and he said "too hot." Hmm, it must have been too hot one day when I first arrived and without saying anything about it, just decided the slide was not a good thing to do anymore. </p>
<p>Akane stayed home and slept, and when we walked in an hour and a half later, she had cooked us all some vegetarian fried rice; it was delicious and Riku ate a huge bowl of it, with some "ice cream" and strawberries for dessert. </p>
<p>Akane did not feel well after lunch, so our plans changed once again; By this time Riku was really exhausted and coughing a bit (Akane now has a full-blown cold and a cough as well), so into bed they both went. Riku did go right to sleep this time, thank goodness, and Akane woke up when she heard a delivery man at the door. I was still working on my blog, and Akane went back to bed with Riku. </p>
<p>A while later she came out for some tea, and Riku wandered out shortly thereafter, looking dazed and confused. I picked him up, sat in a chair, covered him up and he was sound asleep in my arms in a minute. I sat and read my book for a while like this; Riku shifted in my arms a couple of times but was breathing heavily and in a deep sleep for another half hour. </p>
<p>He awakened slowly and was not interested in going out to the park (obviously not feeling quite up to par), so we had some quiet time at home. He drew again, drove around in his little car and at one point, busy with the car turned on its side and using his kitchen knives as tools, he called over to me "Nana, fix the engine"! I went over and did my best, which was enough to please Riku. He is really into playacting right now, and wants me to talk to his animals, ask them questions, have them answer, and gets involved himself by using different tones of voice when he speaks. </p>
<p>We all three sat together at 4:30 to watch "ABC" again on tv. A lot of it was a repeat from last night but there were a few new segments as well. One was a little scary for Riku; an animated doctor was dressed up as a knight, with a big sword, and was frightening the "children". Riku stood back quite a few feet by the end of the tatami room door, just barely looking at it. I did tell him it was just a man wearing a mask but until he saw that for himself he wasn't any too keen on being closer. </p>
<p>Riku sat with a place mat on his lap eating a bowl of strawberries and orange segments while watching the show. He likes fruit as much as I do; now if we could only get him eating peas, and beans, and broccoli! </p>
<p>Akane hadn't been outside today, Riku was showing signs of being a little difficult and so I suggested we all go off for a walk in the park. We left at 5:30; it was quite cool, and Riku needed another layer on. Akane was bundled up, wearing Riku's scarf too, and I wished I had put on a long-sleeved blouse. The wind was quite cool, but of course the sun felt good, and there were so many people in the park on bikes, walking their dogs, and with their children in the sandbox area. </p>
<p>A woman sitting there while her child ran around a field practicing for a relay event, took quite a shine to our boy. She and Akane exchanged some information about Riku... how old he is, how much Japanese he speaks, and she was trying to convince her daughter to speak English to Riku, so she could practice on him. She and Riku kicked a ball around, he followed a couple of children up the slide and then went down, as though he had never stopped! </p>
<p>A quick trip to the grocery store for some bean sprouts for Akane; she has a yen for them, and some salmon to make up into rice bowls for them, and back we were at home at 7 p.m. Riku is always ready to eat, and must have been extra hungry today, as he asked for yogurt. I bought a bag of chips for myself downstairs, and Riku insisted on carrying the bag all the way up to our place; I had no idea he would know what they were but he cried when I took the bag from him to put away! So, he was <strong>really</strong> hungry! I asked him if he wanted porridge or pasta and he chose porridge. I commented to Akane that no matter how often I intend to make a smaller portion, I always end up with a big bowl! I split it in half, intending to save the rest for tomorrow. However, Riku ate all but one small bite of it; the reason I end up with so much is because I also put a spoonful of four-grain cereal in it, and cranberries and blueberries and flax seed and wheat germ! It's very hearty, and I like him to eat a bowl once a day. He finished, I asked if he would like some toast. "OK" says he, and when that was done he asked for dessert! Out came a bowl of strawberries, followed by some grapes, which he speared with the tiny sword from the luncheon outing the other day, and finally a very small bowl of potato chips which he ate so nicely, one small bite at a time, obviously loving them as much as his Nana does! </p>
<p>Bath time right after dinner tonight, as it was later than usual. Akane had cleaned the tub out today, and emptied it of water. I hadn't noticed and so when we went in the tub was completely empty! In a way this worked well, as Akane started it running and Riku enjoyed a sit down tub for the first time since I arrived. The water goes in so slowly that he had a lovely, relaxing, leisurely tub time tonight, whilst sitting! </p>
<p>We decided it would be a good idea for him to sleep with me tonight, to avoid lying next to Akane while she feels so tough. He was okay with that, as long as his mommy tucked him into my room, which she did. It's now ten o'clock on the nose, and I am off to bed. Had no personal emails today, except for Bryn this morning, so I shall leave catching up for another day. I'm tired, and so glad that I am once again caught up on my blog!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/a_very_busy_saturday.html">A Very Busy Saturday</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke up beside me at 6:30 this morning; we stayed in bed for another fifteen minutes, while I told him about all the people in SF (Daddy, Grandpa, Amelia, Auntie Susan, Kevin, Brent, and Lili), all the things at our homes (his own bed, his own room, all his toys, his red chair at Nana's and Grandpa's house, monkey, big mouse, little mouse, his cars in the basket, upstairs with the big box of blocks) and then some of the places we go to (the playground, the backyard with the hose, Ocean Beach, and the zoo). He just lay there so quietly and you could see how much attention he was paying to each and every thing. </p>
<p>Riku wasn't a hungry boy this morning; he did cough a bit and ate only a few bites of yogurt, and some veggie juice, while drawing. He did play very happily for the longest time with his blocks, though, making a huge tower using most of them. I was at the computer while he was busy, and he brought his "<strong>big</strong> tower!" in to show me. Then we sat together and built a bridge out of the blocks Bryn brought back for him, from Manila I believe. I'm not much of an engineering person, but it looked pretty darned good when we finished it; one could drive a car under it, so Riku was very pleased. He drove around in his car for a bit, and was also playing a bit of the devil... opening and closing the big closet in the tatami room where the extra futons and blankets are stored, shutting it quickly when his mom approached! </p>
<p>I went in to shower after answering a couple of emails; when I came out, Riku and Akane were sitting at the table going through the Golden Book memory cards I brought with me. Kelly had given them to me for Riku last trip home. Akane was giving him all the names in Japanese and he was busy repeating them and stacking the cards together after each one. A couple of days ago, I taught him how to even them up once he had a stack of them, and reminded him about that today. He did a great job; one more skill to chalk up on the ever-increasing list of accomplisments these days! </p>
<p>Riku had finished his yogurt during that time; I gave him some grapes and a half slice of cinnamon raisin toast, which he ate before we left for a walk/nap. I had suggested to Akane this morning that we go out to the big department store so I could buy a couple of birthday gifts; the plan was to have Riku nap in the stroller while Akane showered, give him a little lunch, and then walk to Takishamiya.</p>
<p>We left at 10:15, later than I planned, and of course Riku needed to walk a bit first. He is so much happier about making the decision to go in the stroller on his own, and always does as he gets tired after walking for a while. Despite his early awakening, though, today he was quite happy to stroll along the quiet side streets I chose, stopping to collect a few rocks, pressing his nose against a fence, watching the children play in a school yard, admiring the odd cat or dog passing our way, and just generally being interested in his world. </p>
<p>I quite enjoy this quiet meandering time myself. At one point Riku sat down on the tiniest little curb and said "I tired." I asked if he was ready to sit in his stroller and he said "Not yet, I just tired." First time for that phrase! About forty-five minutes after we left he said he would sit and have a snack, which really meant he was tired. He just held on to the cookie container, drank a little water, and was fast asleep within minutes. </p>
<p>Well, I walked and I walked and I walked! this way and every way, down narrow alleyways with very modest and often very run-down homes, past very large and beautifully maintained homes, taking lots of photos again today of futons airing on balconies and railings (it was a gorgeous day and I guess all the housewives were taking advantage of the sun), of an interesting carport arrangement that is very popular here (and which I think would sell very well back home), and of a few other things I thought would make good reminders of my trip. </p>
<p>Riku was still asleep two hours later! I was ready to stop at any time but just kept walking. In total I was gone for three hours! Akane was sitting here ready to go, and no doubt hungry too, as the plan was for us to have lunch out. I thought that we would be home forty-five minutes earlier but there is no way to predict how long a child will nap. He was still a little groggy when he woke up. </p>
<p>I made him a bowl of porridge with cranberries and blueberries, and he ate a modest portion of it, but his appetite is still not up to par. It was late enough now that we decided to take the bus to the store; Riku had had enough sitting in the stroller by that time anyway. And a bus ride! How exciting for Riku; it was just the thing to perk him up and make him look forward to being dragged away from his "buldings".</p>
<p>On the way down to the bus area, we stopped while Akane chatted to one of the shopkeepers. Riku was running back and forth between them and me, when we both spotted Akane's dad coming along behind Akane. Riku was just thrilled to bits! Gigi got a very big hug and a most enthusiastic greeting! He was there to accompany his old friend from high school, who runs the shop, to visit with a third friend in the hospital. It was such a coincidence to run into him, and as a parting goodbye Riku pulled up his shirt to show his grandfather his belly! We all laughed and then dashed to catch our bus, due to leave at 2:10, just minutes away! </p>
<p>It was a very exciting trip. Riku sat beside me and pointed out all the buses, the bridges, the cars ("There is a red car!") and a taxi... very exciting indeed, with such a great view from his window seat. The trip didn't last long enough for Riku though, and we planned to walk home. </p>
<p>First stop... lunch! We went to the same place that we ate in on Mother's Day last Sunday, specializing in tempura. We had the same meal... tempura vegetables for me with kabocha squash (my favourite), green pepper, broccoli, yam, and shiitake mushroom, all served with rice, a few pickled vegetables, miso soup with a bit of seaweed, and a tiny dish with about a tablespoon of delicious potato salad and corn niblets. I could easily have eaten ten times the amount! It was all so good and I offered to buy lunch but Akane insisted it was her treat. </p>
<p>Riku had developed an appetite and ate about half my rice (Akane ordered more as there is no charge for extra rice and tea), a few bites of my squash (Akane ordered him his own piece), one large ebi (shrimp), and some of my soup too. </p>
<p>We did a little shopping around, with lots of running/exploring time for Riku. He needed it and was so happy dashing about, seeing all the interesting things there are in department stores, especially the toy department. Today he discovered a toy microwave oven, and he was so reluctant to leave it! I'm sure he spent a good fifteen minutes putting a 'carrot ' on a plate, pushing the start button, watching it spin around and around, and then pushing the stop button... and beginning the process all over again. I'm sure he was thinking what a perfect addition this would be to his kitchen! </p>
<p>We set off for our walk home about 4:15; it was a gorgeous afternoon, and I was glad to have Akane out enjoying it too. Riku did not nap, much to my surprise, as he was tired again. He sat up nice and straight in his stroller, taking in all there was to see on the way home, chatting away with us and enjoying himself. We arrived home about 5 p.m., and it was certainly too late for a nap by then. Riku was happy to be home playing with his cars; he made a very long train track completely on his own and went crawling along the floor with that, in all three of the main rooms. He was really loud too!!! Every once in a while he does this; he seems to enjoy hearing that voice of his. Akane tried her best to hush him up a bit, to no avail! All that pent up energy had to go somewhere, I guess, and he wasn't being destructive, just <strong>loud</strong>! Very funny really. </p>
<p>Bryn called to speak to him just after this outburst of noise, and he settled in to have a nice long conversation with his daddy. He had been sitting snacking at the table (cheddar cheese and strawberries) and just leaned his head on my arm, letting me hold the phone to his ear, and chatted away, answering questions and filling his dad in on his life. I am quite sure it was the longest phone conversation they have ever had; Riku had so much to say "Oh, yes!", and "Butterfly in here", and "making tunnel and towers", "eating cheese and strawberries" and oh-so-many other things. It was lovely to hear it all. I noticed that he told his dad that he was going on a train, through a tunnel, to the airport, and on a plane with Mommy and Nana. He also said that Grandpa and Daddy and Auntie Kelly would be at the airport. It's so interesting to hear how often Riku mentions Kelly and often the children too. He did tell Bryn that Uncle Gregg would not be at the airport so he is still obviously holding out for Auntie Kelly... if one wishes long enough... and says it often enough... perhaps... </p>
<p>I got to talk with Bryn too, and hear how amazed he was. It was late for Bryn though, and past time for his bed, so I passed the phone to Akane and then coaxed Riku over to me with a book he had brought out from Akane's room earlier. It was in Japanese, but had a few illustrations so he sat on my lap and we looked at and discussed "what's happening?" </p>
<p>Interestingly enough, after Akane got off the phone, Riku asked if he could watch TV. He hadn't watched any today at all, and he did need to slow down a bit before bedtime so we said sure. Akane said she had a video of the book we had been reading, a Russian story from thirty or forty years ago, animated, and with four or five short parts to it. Well, it was adorable; Riku laughed out loud, real belly laughs several times, and of course he enjoyed seeing the alligator, the "angry" woman, the little girl, and the animals we had just been looking at in the book. I like to pull a chair up beside Riku while he watches a show, and often Akane will as well, so we can discuss with him what is going on. I had a hot cup of tea (I was more than ready for it), and eventually Riku wanted up in my lap. </p>
<p>Since he was a little fussy about his food today, I asked him if he would like pasta for dinner or an egg. An egg was his choice and so Akane made him an almost-hard-boiled egg, still a little creamy, a half slice of whole wheat toast cut in long slim pieces, and some chopped fresh tomatoes. He ate every single bite of it; I asked if he wanted a slice of "bacon" and he said "OK", and then I asked if he wanted some dessert and he said "OK", and when the strawberries had been polished off I asked if he wanted half a banana and he said "OK"! and drank some veggie juice too. I told Akane he might explode at any moment. </p>
<p>I suggested (to him) turning the TV off so he could play and off it went! What an amiable little boy this is! He got straight back to work with his vehicles, and while he was playing I asked if he wanted to have a bath tonight. He said "no bath" and went back to his toys. I was so surprised as he really enjoys his tub time, so I knelt beside him and had him look at me, while I explained that I didn't mean a bath right now but a little later. He thought about it and told me "OK, bath time later". </p>
<p>It takes about twenty minutes to heat the water in the tub up, so the timing was perfect. As soon as I suggested that it was time to get undressed, he was up and pulling down his pants. He has been working away at dressing and undressing for days now, and is getting darned good at it. Tonight when we came in, he managed to get both shoes off on his own (he uses a little ledge in the front hall as a wedge... Bryn, you had better come up with a substitute!), then struggled but got both socks off as well. But tonight he took off his own pants (he has to be reminded to pull at the back too!), holds on to the table to step out of them, then struggles with that shirt!, undoes his diaper, and after I roll it up he takes it to the garbage in the kitchen. That is one cute naked little body walking around; Akane and I shared a big smile at the sight of it tonight. </p>
<p>I told him it was time to sit on the toilet and the routine is always the same... he opens the door first (and heaven forbid that you open it!) , then turns on the light... never, ever, the other way around. I popped him up on the toilet, and... drum roll!!!! ... he urinated again! Much clapping ensued and he gave the traditional manly "shake, shake, shake" before getting off. </p>
<p>Akane is not finding her deep hot soaks in the tub very comfortable lately, so after cleaning the tub the other day decided to just partially fill it. Riku enjoyed standing up in it such deep water, but he is also enjoying sitting in the warm water as he can splash madly! and does! without it going all over, or at least anywhere that matters.</p>
<p>Then followed the usual bedtime routine: Akane lays out his diaper, t-shirt, and creams, and I prep him for bed; I told him that his mommy was still sick (she is feeling better though, and the sore throat from yesterday has gone) so he was going to sleep with me. He told me "mommy tuck in" and I assured him that yes, his mommy would tuck him in my bed. They were in the room at 8:15 and Akane was out brushing her teeth at 8:30! </p>
<p>It's now 10 p.m., my blog is done and I am off to bed too. Akane said goodnight a half hour ago... as Riku says "See you tomorrow!" </p>
<p>my p.s. tonight, rather than going all the way up to the right spot to insert it, is:</p>
<p>When Riku and I were building the tunnel this morning we were trying to use up all the pieces; Riku was digging through the box for them and handing them to me. When passing me one he said "One piece in box!" and sure enough, there was just one piece left!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/what_a_busy_sunday.html">What a Busy Sunday!</a></h2>
								<p>What a lovely beginning to my day today... Riku woke very slowly at 6:30, after going to sleep last night at 8:30...  a full ten hours straight through with not one waking period in the night. He was in the same position at 6:30 a.m. as he was last night when I went to bed... head on his pillow and sleeping on his back. I know he rolled over a couple of times but his head stayed on the pillow all night, quite a different boy from the one who rolls all over in his sleep, including on top of Akane! Hope this is a permanent change for his mommy's sake.</p>
<p>He wakens very quietly, or at least did today. I kept my eyes closed and listened to him talking to himself very quietly, and watching his own fingers moving around in the air. Very sweet. His eyes would be open, then he would shut them, and a few minutes later would open them again. I rolled over and said "good morning" and then that beam was aimed right at me! I asked him if he would like to get up, and he said his first "OK!" of the day. </p>
<p>Riku didn't cough all night and only once or twice this morning, but his appetite was a bit off so I guess he is not feeling quite well yet. He did end up finishing his yogurt and half banana, but it took over an hour. He was a busy boy though, playing with me in his little corner of the world. Akane had gone back to bed after being up a couple of times in the night, a typical situation for her unfortunately, so Riku and I had "cake" and "oranges" and today he was into naming the colours of the plates and utensils. "Oh, you have a blue plate." "Oh, your fork is green!" "Have a blue fork!" and he would switch it for me. "What is this?" is his most often-used phrase, I would say. And his response to an answer tends to be to repeat it back to you "Oh, that is light blue!" </p>
<p>We also played planes, trains, and automobiles, as he knows he is going home soon. He repeats several times a day that Daddy and "Blaunka" will be there to see us. I think he is missing his dad for certain, as he often says out of the blue "Where is Daddy?" ... and then, "Oh, Daddy be at airport." </p>
<p>I decided to take Riku out again today for his long morning nap, as we are going to Namba in Osaka to have lunch with Akane's mom. We were to meet at 1:30, which isn't too far off Riku's nap time, so a good nap this morning would have been ideal... but didn't happen. </p>
<p>We left at 10 a.m. Riku walked happily along, exploring as usual, and today he found a fantastic little bug that I have never seen before... it looked as though someone had taken tiny little fine branches and glued them together to form a not-larger-than one inch bug. Riku managed to spot it climbing up a wall; it was so hard to see it as it blended right into the wood, but he had his nose almost right up to it, looking sideways to see it walk. When I peeked at it, it looked as though it had a siphon for a mouth, filled with tiny eggs. It stopped moving completely while we watched and we finally moved on ourselves. How wonderful to have a little person discovering these things I would surely have missed. </p>
<p>I decided to walk to the shopping centre, which is at the next train station. Akane and I walked home from there yesterday, which is when I discovered that I had made it there on my own the day before, within two blocks of it! I wanted to see if I could find it again, this time deliberately. I did, with no problem at all. Riku had been sleeping about forty minutes at this point and, unfortunately, there was a large group of women and children, all standing in a row with their boxes, shouting out for people to donate. A couple of young girls were particularly loud and it woke Riku up; such a shame as he didn't manage to get back to sleep. </p>
<p>On the way home, I spotted a very new and sparkling clean little shop selling Italian gelato (ice cream). I thought what a nice treat that would be for both Riku and me; he loves ice cream and I haven't had gelato in years. A very friendly young woman allowed me to sample the three flavours I was curious about... vanilla with little pieces of dark chocolate mixed in with it, fresh strawberry, and a plain vanilla. I chose the strawberry, as it was so amazingly good!, but will be back for some of the chocolate bits one soon. The plain vanilla was just too bland, but I noticed they had one with vanilla specks so shall try a sample of that one next. Riku and I sat with our tiny spoons, taking one bite each in turn. I helped Riku load up his spoon a bit, as he was enjoying it as much as I was. There were good sized pieces of fresh strawberry in it too. Soooo good! "This is delicious!", said Riku as he was about to drink the last of the melted dessert. I told Akane about it when we got home and since her eyes lit up at the telling, we shall most certainly be going back! </p>
<p>I had misgivings about going out to a nice restaurant with Riku in need of a good sleep. He had thown his new little fire truck (his going-to-the-toilet-successfully gift from me last night) on the ground coming into the building when I told him he could not bring his stick collection into the house. This is an absolutely a sure sign that he needs to sleep; otherwise, he would have just said "ok" when I suggested leaving them where we could find them later. </p>
<p>Akane seemed reluctant to go on her own for lunch with her mom; Riku had an hour to play a bit at home, but did not want to eat much for lunch either... hmmm. I would have chosen to stay home with him, but off we went for a train ride! and to see Baa-baa, both of which Riku was happy about. Getting him into the stroller was a smart move, as he was tired enough to just lay back a bit and relax. Our train at 1:07 was delayed because of an accident (this happened the other day too), and so we took a later one, and then a subway, meeting Mrs. Goda a half hour later than planned. </p>
<p>Lunch was a real treat for me; Mrs. Goda had decided we should go to a restaurant that specializes in tofu dishes, one of my very favourite foods. They gave me a wonderful selection of non-meat and seafood dishes, and every single one of the perhaps dozen dishes was just a delight... mostly one- or two-bite tastes... tofu cubes, a soup with tofu skin in a wonderful broth, a pasty so-good dab or two of prepared tofu served with a zingy mustard, and others I can't recall right now. Oh, I had a tofu salad... greens... watercress and lettuce, with a delicious dressing and all served on top of a soft and flavoured tofu. We had a nice good sized pot of mixed rices with tiny bits of vegetable in it, and sweet plum wine (I also got to drink Akane's peachy-tasting one), lots of tea, and then finished off with the most amazing tofu dish I have ever had. It honestly, truly, tasted like one of the best crème brûlées I have had... I would never in a million years thought that it was made with tofu. The caramel sauce served on it, was delicious as well... and Mrs. Goda bought us each one to take home! </p>
<p>Riku had a few bites of his grandma's lunch; theirs was served in a very large basket with a top layer of separated areas for the little dishes holding different foods... Mrs. Goda also bought Riku a wooden box with rice in it; he ate a few bites of it too, using the tiny spoon it came with. I must get a photo of it; stay tuned for photos of our lunch dishes! </p>
<p>Riku nursed about halfway through the meal; he was so tired and couldn't be expected to sit still and quiet for much longer. Akane asked if he would like to nurse and he was over on her side of the table in seconds! Such a lucky boy; Akane was still eating but he fell fast asleep nursing and I managed to get him into his stroller successfully after we had finished eating. Whew! He slept for almost two hours, despite the noise of the huge underground walkways leading from one area to another, and in the stores and elevators as well. </p>
<p>Mrs. Goda bought herself two beautiful new outfits at a display of exclusive clothing and craft displays; one of her favourite designers was there, and she introduced Akane and me and showed off Riku sleeping soundly. I was so afraid that one of them would waken him up as a few of the women, in their enthusiasm, would either go too closely or speak too loudly into the stroller! I got him moving asap! </p>
<p>I spotted a nice navy skirt that I pointed out to Akane, and she realized it had an elastic waist. No price on it, so a woman offered to get her someone who ran that booth, to help her. By this time, Mrs. Goda had finished purchasing her second outfit, came over and started to bargain down the asking price considerably. It was funny to see actually, as the two women were kind of batting away at each other with their hands, laughing but both being very serious about their positions!  Mrs. Goda won! Akane has a new skirt and top, courtesy of her mom. </p>
<p>We wandered around Takashimaya for quite a long time; Mrs. Goda is a shopper! I can see where Akane learned to love just poking through stores; she learned from a master! It seemed we were up and down elevators all afternoon, but it was fun as long as I could keep moving Riku along. I bought myself a pair of the slippers I love, just to have a spare on hand at home. Mrs. Goda bought Riku a set of twelve new cars, a "special colour collection of Tomika cars". Before giving it to Riku, we went off to have tea. It was in a small open restaurant/tea room and we ordered tea and two orders of scones. I asked Akane if the tea was really $7 each and she verified that yes, it was. We were each poured one cup of tea and then a pot of very nice Assam tea was put on the table. The scones were delicious but not huge; Riku and I shared an order of two small scones, and Akane and her mom shared the second... freshly whipped cream and blueberry jam. Riku was just delighted with his dessert and I have a photo of him to prove it. I treated for tea; it was the only time I have been allowed to pick up the tab. </p>
<p>Mrs. Goda had to leave, and I suggested to Akane that she give Riku the cars first so she would see his reaction; it was all a grandmother could hope for... the smile and the genuine delight could not have been any better! He carried the big box on his lap all the way to the train station. We did stop first at Muji to pick up a couple of small items, and then headed for home at 6:35! What a long day out for Riku, with much of it spent in his stroller. Tomorrow he is going to spend lots of time running and walking outside. </p>
<p>We did have a short but such a nice evening with him before he went to bed though. Akane went to the grocery store for more strawberries for Riku, his veggie/fruit juice mixture, and Kleenex. Riku and I came right upstairs, with him running the full length of the long outdoor hallway to our building. He wanted to be the one to open the door to the building before the family walking behind us did; I must admit I was coaxing him to run, as I wanted to get those little legs moving a bit. </p>
<p>The minute he had his sandals off (first time entirely on his own!), he asked for his new cars. I opened up the set and he sat at the table lining them all up and then asking me, and pointing at each one separately, twice, "What colour is this one?" Of course he knows most of the colours already, but there was a gray one, a beige, and a burgandy, all new to him and perhaps he didn't want to admit to it! </p>
<p>He asked for a banana, ate about half of the oatmeal with cranberries he told me he didn't want, asked for more banana, and since Akane had had to substitute "American Cherries" for strawberries (they ran out), he also had three cherries cut in two. $1.78 for twelve cherries! Did he love those cherries! They were gone in less than a minute, but since he threw a piece of banana on the floor and didn't eat the rest of it, we are saving those cherries for a boy who is less tired tomorrow. Riku knows when he has done something he shouldn't have and doesn't argue the fact.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/a_long_and_very_successful_day.html">A Long and Very Successful Day!</a></h2>
								<p>I awoke at 7:30 a.m. and tiptoed out of my room to work on my emails. All was quiet, but Riku was watching TV, and playing with his cars. He ate a little yogurt and later some toast and three more of the very expensive cherries. While changing his diaper I put him on the toilet and he was once again successful! I popped in the shower quickly, as Akane was leaving at 8:30 to walk to city hall, then on to her parents' place to meet Ayako, and from there to Akane's doctor appointment. Before she left, however, I once again asked Riku if he wanted to sit on the toilet; he said "OK", Akane put him on, and voila! I think he's got it! </p>
<p>After Akane left, Riku and I read some stories, played with his cars, and I prepared my breakfast... a hash brown potato square from the bakery downstairs, bought by Akane for me last night, and a perfect fried egg. Riku is gaining weight and I am losing it, and it's mostly because he has been eating half of my meals this trip! He ate so much of it that I cooked another egg and heated up the hash browns I had saved for tomorrow.</p>
<p>It was obvious that Riku was ready for a BM after he urinated again, and so I left his diaper off, hoping that would make it more obvious to him that he needed to sit on the toilet. He wasn't keen about this. At one point he asked, "Diaper back on!" and once it was he quietly went into a private spot on his own. Being a Nana with some experience I figured out what was happening and so quickly got that diaper off and Riku on the toilet. Nada! I don't think he is quite ready for this, so the diaper went on again. He held off all day until we got to his Bahbah's! Funny, no matter how many people there are around I seem to be the one who changes diapers; I even stayed in the tatami room so that his aunt or Bahbah could do it, but it was obvious that no one was too keen to get at it. I don't mind a bit; that is one cute little bottom! </p>
<p>I did up the dishes and we set off for the park as soon as I made up the snack containers. Our first object of the day was to see if by some stroke of good luck his sticks from yesterday were still where he left them, not too far from the door of the building; they were, and Riku was just delighted. On to the park I went with a happy little boy carrying his bundle of sticks. It was perfect timing, as there was a day care group there, with seven children accompanied by two women. One woman was having such fun with the children, running around the playground with them  following her, and scraping her heel in the sand making a track for them to follow. Riku joined in without hesitation. At one point the children spotted a butterfly; Riku was standing watching it flit about but the other children started shrieking and trying to chase it, which of course Riku started doing immediately. It was hilarious to see, actually, this group behaviour with him.</p>
<p>One little fellow went off to the furthest corner of the area, with shade, and a big pile of sand as well. Riku joined him and the teacher, sitting happily, chatting away. I went over when she wandered off to the other children, and took a couple of photos. This child obviously knows about digital cameras as each time I took one he came over to have a look, and wanted the camera too! </p>
<p>Sadly, the children left too soon for Riku's liking, so he walked around a bit before he tuckered out and I put him in the stroller. He snacked and slept for an hour and twenty minutes; it was perfect for walking... not too hot and not too cool, but just right. </p>
<p>Home for lunch as soon as he woke up, a little time at home playing, but then off to the little playground downstairs as it is too nice to be in and we hadn't been there for several days. I hadn't bothered taking the sand toys down as I was sure there would be other children there. I suggested to Riku that we go up and get them. He agreed but made sure we were coming back by saying "Not go home yet; get toys and go to playground. Not go home yet.", nodding his head in agreement with me. He was confident that I knew what he meant. Riku was quite happy playing with his sand toys on his own, but soon children arrived from school, wearing their navy and white uniforms and hats. </p>
<p>A few of the girls recognized us from quite a distance and waved enthusiastically, coming right over to say hello. There are twin girls, seven years old, who didn't go upstairs to change their clothes but went right into the sandbox to play with Riku. Of course he was delighted, and they stayed for the hour we were there. They like to try to chat with me and I sing to them. We did ABCD again and "head and shoulders" several times. One of them taught me how to play "paper, rock, scissors" by counting (I think to three) and then showing your hand. They were delighted that I knew how to play that game! </p>
<p>Since the one little girl kept singing ABC, I asked for paper and pencil and wrote out the upper case; we sang along with me pointing to the letters and we practiced saying "Z' which is difficult when your ttop teeth are missing! I told them in Canada we said "zed" and in America they say "zee". They repeated it both ways several times. Then I printed my name, and Riku's and they wrote theirs. By this time a third child joined us; she had gone up to change. They each told me how to spell their names in English although Akane thinks one of them has it wrong. The twins are Aya and Ui... Akane thinks it is Yui for sure, and the third girl is Junne, an unusual name says Akane. Then the twins drew pictures of their faces and had me do mine and Riku's! I did the lower case for them too and once again they broke into ABC with vigour! What enthusiasm! So very cute. I was hoping to keep the paper but it was obvious they wanted it so I took what I hope is a good photo of it. </p>
<p>... a little side story here I meant to write up the other night. The night that Akane, Riku, and I headed over to the park across the street in the evening, so that Akane got out for a bit, we met up with the twins and two younger siblings. The twins, I learned yesterday, are seven, and my guess is that the siblings were five and three. They were alone and about to cross a fairly busy road; it was about 7:30 or 8 p.m. I asked Akane to ask where their parents were as they seemed to be alone. They were; their parents were both at work! Akane told me this is not uncommon here. The children have a key, I suppose their dinners are left out for them, and she said they are very responsible. But of course I wondered what would happen if one of the little ones disappeared, and how they would manage to get help if they ran into trouble. There was an older brother somewhere too, but he wasn't with them, and they didn't seem concerned at all. </p>
<p>Riku and I left our friends at 3 p.m. The grand plan for the afternoon was for Riku to have a later afternoon nap than usual, as we are due at the Goda's at 7 p.m. for a special ceremony. Akane's niece is three months old, and there is a tradition that they get a taste of solid food, which in this case is an octopus. They call it "kissing an octopus". There was to be a big catered dinner of bento boxes brought in, and Akane's mother had worked hard to get everything in order for this evening. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it turned out, we had told Riku he was going to his Bahbah's house later. Big mistake! I think it was on his mind from the time he got into that stroller. He would be drifting off and then sit up and say "Go to Bahbah's house!" I would say "Yes, later we are going to Bahbah's house." Fifteen minutes later, when I was sure he was asleep I would take a peek and he would open those sleepy eyes and say "Play with Auntie Ayako"... and so it went... "See baby", and "Play house". My back was giving out on me, trying to walk quickly to help the sandman along but nothing worked. I walked until almost 5:15 p.m., and finally decided I would try my luck at home, in an air-conditioned room. </p>
<p>Thank goodness Akane walked in just as I had put him on the toilet for the seventh successful time this day!!!... once in the public toilet downstairs! I thought a little nursing time with his mom would do the trick, and sat down to write a couple of emails. A half hour later guess who was out, beaming away, with a frustrated mommy? I knew there was going to be trouble in River City if he didn't get some sleep. I envisioned precious things flying at his Buhbuh's house and a shrieking boy running around madly, while the baby howled! So, off I went with him for another try. It almost worked about five times... drifting off in my arns, head down, and then up would come that head and he would be grinning away. Once he was face down, breathing heavily, and then rolled over, and said "Go to Buhbuh's house now?" Oy vay! </p>
<p>It was too late to do a thing about this by now. I lay him on the kitchen counter, washed his hair, popped him in a warm tub, to at least relax him a bit, and dressed him, while Akane was downstairs doing last-minute shopping before our grocery store downstairs closes for three days. Ayako was downstairs waiting for us, and drove us at last to Bahbah's house! Gigi was there too, and Auntie Ayako, Akane's brother, his wife, and their sweet sweet baby, who made barely a peep all night. She sleeps through the night! and has for ages (Riku too is sleeping through the night and has for about ten days!). I have oodles of photos of her and of everyone else too. </p>
<p>Before sitting down to our very elaborate dinner, Gigi held the baby, who was beautifully dressed in a long pink brocade gown, every bit of her covered up except her darling face. Mrs. Goda handed him a piece of octopus with chop sticks, he took them and put it to the baby's mouth. She grimaced and turned away! Everyone laughed; turns out that no one ate the octopus on their plates. Riku looked at it at one point and asked me "What is this?" I told him it was octopus and he said "Riku not like octopus". Well, neither do his mom or uncle or auntie, so that is fine. I don't think the Goda's Sr. ate any either. Both children had very large settings of food ordered for them as well. They had a whole fish each, complete with head and teeth and tail. Riku didn't touch his; I think it was going to be eaten at the Goda's for lunch today. He did eat battered shrimp, though, and went around trying to entice everyone else out of theirs! The second one he ate he was crunching away at the tail; I told him not to eat the tail (he hadn't with the first one) but Akane said that was fine, that many people do. And I got to change that diaper today! Akane said she was going to throw up! </p>
<p>Back to the party... Mrs. Goda had ordered an all-vegetarian bento box for me and it was all delicious: lots of little dishes filled with assorted shapes and colours of vegetables and tofu, lots of tasty and new to me flavours, and a lovely fruit plate, just small, with fresh pineapple and an orange section. Everyone had these and Riku went around asking for strawberries. I'm glad strawberry season will not be over when we get home. And we must make sure to get him some Olson's cherries in July! </p>
<p>Lots of chatting over dinner, eyes on Riku, who was in such a happy mood, flitting about and not paying a lot of attention to the baby, but some... giving her a rattle several times, touching her cheek twice, but mostly entertaining the crowd. He is a party man; it would have been awfully quiet there without him! </p>
<p>After dinner, Akane, Ayako, and their brother went upstairs to the computer... maybe something to do with their digital cameras... Riku was with them and Mrs. Goda invited me to sit in her massage chair. It's a wonder I am not still there! However, Riku came down the stairs on his own too quickly during that time and fell (he is limping a bit today, told Akane this morning his foot hurt), and so we, along with the baby and her parents, made our exits. It was late enough; home at 10:30 and straight into bed for Riku, after brushing of teeth, and successful toilet trip number eight!! What a guy! </p>
<p>I did sit down to write this blog but was honestly just too tired. I couldn't think of a way to make it shorter as there was so much to share.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/six_days_left.html">Six Days Left...</a></h2>
								<p>I was in bed and asleep by 11 p.m. last night, too tired to write my blog or even think about what to say. I read perhaps three paragraphs (still working my way through the stack of New Yorker fiction I brought with me) before turning off my light. </p>
<p>My inner alarm seems to go off at 5:30 a.m. occasionally, but I read, dozed, read, and dozed, until 7:15. The house was very quiet and once again I thought I would get a head start on that blog, but Akane was at the computer and Riku was busy nursing. He woke at 7 a.m. and was very obviously still tired. It took him a while to come 'round (didn't want his diaper changed) which is not surprising after just eight hours sleep. </p>
<p>Soon though he rallied, and was a busy boy with his new cars, until he was ready for a bowl of yogurt and half of a banana. I knew he would be ready for an early nap today, so I got into the shower immediately, had a few nuts, and sat and drank the hot chocolate that Akane had made for me. </p>
<p>Riku and I were out the door at 9:15 (after three "yay Riku" trips to the bathroom already); we walked to the park but there were no children at the playground, so instead we walked around the cemetery grounds, which has a bounty of apparently very interesting rocks; Riku needed a bag for his treasures and was very busy picking up more than he ever has in one trip. Such booty!</p>
<p>As we were walking along, I decided I would teach Riku two things... how to tell someone his name and what to say when someone asks him how he is. Both these things are asked frequently, as well as how old he is. So, we practiced... "How are you?"... "Fine, kank u"... and we worked on "And how are you?" too. He surprised his mom at lunch time with his answers. And he is doing well with "My name is Riku" too, although it might be easier to start with just "Riku". </p>
<p>Riku is an enthusiastic learner and doesn't seem to mind practicing these things one bit. It's adorable. This morning, as we headed out of the building, we ran into the woman who runs the dress shop downstairs; she and Riku are on familiar terms and she was so happy to see him walking toward her. He is so gracious and gave her a big warm smile, saying "ohayo" in response to her "good morning" and then leaving her with "buh bye; see you later!" Many people say "bye bye" here so that is easy. </p>
<p>At 10 a.m. he was in his stroller, eating his grapes followed by the assorted bread items... a few cheese bunnies, some toast, and two tiny pretzels. Nap time followed quickly, as I knew it would. He slept for an hour and twenty minutes. </p>
<p>We just happened to be in the neighbourhood of the gelato place (how fortunate that this is a nice shady street, as it was very warm out there today!), and even though it was obvious that Riku was still a little tired, I decided that it would be better if he was tired for his afternoon nap as well. Otherwise it makes for a very long day for him, and for his caregivers too! So, it was a strawberry gelato for Riku; he held the cup while I took his photo and ate every last bit of it, drinking the melted remains at the end. Every once in a while he would get too much on his spoon and say "That too big!", and would scrape some off. He also said "I like dessert" and we had a little talk about all the others in his life who like dessert too. </p>
<p>It was such a gorgeous day that I kept walking in the shade until 12:45 when we arrived home. Akane had cooked the two of us a most delicious sweet and sour Chinese vegetable and tofu dish and something else for Riki, with noodles and egg perhaps. Whatever it was, he was only interested in eating <strong>my</strong> tofu cubes, and my sweet potato, and my carrots. What a boy, and he does it all with that gleam in his eyes too! </p>
<p>Akane went out on her own for diapers, and Riku and I tidied up our very messy table. It has been covered with dozens of little cars, fire trucks, planes, buses, and trains for two days now, although it seems much longer than that... as well as all of the dishes from his kitchen set. What a sight! So we got busy. Riku likes cleaning up (last night he managed to get hold of a cloth at Buhbuh's and went around "cleaning", much to everyone's amusement), and we got right to it. All the vehicles are now in three boxes and the table is completely cleared, although I must say that his kitchen area leaves a lot to be desired. For some very odd reason, unbeknown to me, he has refused to put the cutlery in the drawers, the casserole dish in the microwave, or the pots and pans in the oven! </p>
<p>Once that big job was done, I gave Riku one of the tofu puddings his uncle and aunt gave to us last night; they heard through the grapevine that I was very fond of them, and we each have a second one to enjoy. Riku has already had both of his. Once again, he sat and ate every bite of it, this one with the caramel sauce, and reiterated that "I like dessert" and "This is yummy!" </p>
<p>He and his mom went to bed at 2:30 p.m. for a nap; I left the house at 5 p.m.! and meandered around the rose gardens for a bit on my own, found a couple of cute summer dresses for a certain little girl in my life, and dropped into the 100 yen store for toothpaste. I arrived home at 6 p.m. to find that Riku had slept until 5:30. He was sitting in a chair, waiting for his dinner, after telling his mommy he was hungry. He was a little out of sorts with this crazy schedule over the past 24 hours but was soon back to feeling a little better after I read "Small Pig" to him as he ate. He is now doing what his daddy did with this book... finishing up most of the last word on each page; I say "he sat down, and sank down, in the good soft... " and Riku says "mud". I always did this with Kelly and Bryn, and then with Bryn and Caillie too; it's fun to do with their favourite books.</p>
<p>Riku ate well, eating all of the rice and veg' dish and about a third of the egg and spinach dish. Of course he wanted "dessert", and Akane brought in a pretty glass dish with a half banana and some kiwi slices. He lost interest almost immediately but I think he was just full.</p>
<p>Another trip to the bathroom (I lost count today as it happens so often now!), and I suggested that we all head out for a little walk in the park. Akane was reluctant, but Riku said "Mommy come?" and so off we all went. It was a lovely evening, milder than when I was out earlier, as the wind had died down. We ran into the little family of five children today... they came running up as we left through the driveway, not our usual route. There was Aya, and Yui (Akane asked her about the spelling), their five-year-old sister, their two-year-old brother and tonight I met the ten-year-old "big" brother... in charge of all of them on his own. The girls told Akane that they had been to the playground after school so they could practice their English! I felt sorry about this, as I could have gone there instead of to the park; it had crossed my mind when I left, I but didn't go with my instincts. I promised them I would be there tomorrow after school, and had Akane ask them to bring paper and pencils with them. I will try to remember to take a couple of books with me too.... perhaps "Are You My Mother?"</p>
<p>It had just turned dark, Riku spotted a half moon, and we went right over to check that his little stash of rocks and sticks were where we left them yesterday morning. Phew! They were there and he added a few more choice rocks to the site. He sat in the sandbox for a bit, just drawing lines; Akane strolled around some, Riku ran up a couple of little hills ("You're the King of the Castle, I'm the Dirty Rascal", I now sing to him), and Akane suggested that instead of going home right away we go to another supermarket I haven't been to, much smaller than the one we go to downstairs. Their prices are much higher and we checked out a second one as well; Riku was getting tired, sitting down to rest on various perches and in the second store asking me to carry him. He is quite a heavy little weight now, especially when he is tired; I'm going to have to get back to the gym!  </p>
<p>Getting him all the way to the door required some ingenuity on my part... "ready, set, <strong>go</strong>!", and off we all went, practicing our galloping and hiding behind pillars, but he still lay down on the floor a couple of times... pulling faces that made us laugh... eyes rolled up and a funny grimace on his face, that he often pulls when he finds a mirror at his level. </p>
<p>He knows the routine... knew it was bedtime, but said "snack?" and so finished off his banana and kiwi, with a big drink of water. He did ask for a bath but I hadn't heated the water (takes about twenty minutes); it was already late enough and he was a tired boy for certain. So, off came the shoes, "roll, roll, roll" he said as he pulled off his socks and balled them up to stick in his shoes, off came the pants, the diaper, and the shirt with a little help, and yes, another successful bathroom trip. I wonder how long it will take before that look of wonder disappears each time he urinates? It is too cute to see right now! I gave him a nice warmish sink "tubtime" in the bathroom, he asked for the duck to join him and they had a splashy few minutes together, nice big towel, and time for pj's and teeth. He pulls on his undershirt, lays his pj bottoms flat on the floor and sticks his legs in, pulls each one up until his feet show up, and then stands up and struggles to get those bottoms up, even at the back. Bryn, you are going to just love all this! </p>
<p>He was ready to tuck in with his mommy at 8:45 p.m. Akane may be in for the night as well, as she also brushed her teeth before going in to the bedroom with him. Now 9:30 and that's it... the earliest I have finished up a blog this trip! I plan to be in bed in half an hour.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/a_windy_day.html">A Windy Day</a></h2>
								<p>I heard Riku cry out at 5 a.m. today; Akane told me later he had been awake at 2 a.m. with a bad dream. She managed to get him back to sleep but I was unsuccessful; I did read and dozed a bit, but finally gave up at 6 a.m. Riku peeked 'round the corner in the tatami room at me at 6:45, as I was chatting with Bryn on IM. </p>
<p>I got off the computer immediately at Riku's request... "Come play." First a diaper change and getting dressed, although he was in no hurry for either. I don't like him eating in a soggy diaper though, so he had no choice. We played kitchen for a bit, and then he was ready for his breakfast.</p>
<p>While he ate today, I sang him lots of songs. He has started asking me to sing a song about... and then he names something, almost always starting with "a chicken!". The only one that comes to mind is "Old MacDonald Had a Farm", which is just fine with Riku. He adds more animals and sits smiling away while I make animals sounds... usually a dog, cat, and horse. However, we have an action song now, and Riku is just delighted with it. I sing Raffi's "Oh Mr, Sun, Sun, Mister Golden Sun... " and we put our arms and hands up in a big circle above our heads. At "hiding behind a tree" we cover our eyes, and we sway back and forth until we come to "come out and play with you" at which point we are supposed to point to the other person but are still working on that part... and ending with "please shine down on me" by pointing to ourselves. Riku is just loving this! </p>
<p>Another favourite song he asks for is "about nuts"... which is the one Mom taught to wee Bryn one day while sitting in the car while I went in for some groceries with Kelly... "Here we go gathering nuts in May, nuts in May, nuts in May, here we go gahering nuts in May, on a cold and frosty morning!"... Riku sings bit of this with me, so be prepared, Bryn, wth the lyrics in case he asks. We sing "Down at the station, early in the morning", with Riku finishing up by "pull the little handle, chug, chug, toot toot, off we go!", and he almost always ends it by saying "Blaunka say 'All aboard!'", and smiling. I sing "The Big Ship Sails on the alley-alley oh" (or however that is spelled!), and today did lots of nursery rhymes for the first time as well. He liked "Hickory Dickory Dock" and "Three Little Kittens" too. </p>
<p>Back to the kitchen; Riku made me "eggs", using his little plastic flipper to turn it over (Akane has a plastic fried egg for him, but he made me a very delicious imaginery one today), seasoned it with pepper, and then with more when I asked. He did use the whisk on the egg too. I guess he has his own recipe for a fried egg, as he whisked the "egg" in the bowl for quite a while, looking very professional.</p>
<p>Akane took over at 8 a.m. so I could get into the shower. I wanted to get him out fairly early today for a walk/sleep so that we could join Akane in a walk to her mom's. Unfortunately, rain was predicted, but I was willing to take the chance of getting a bit wet. We set off at 10 a.m., after Riku ate a half slice of toast, and a piece of "bacon" for a snack.</p>
<p>We had planned to meet Akane at the door downstairs at 10:30 so that we could walk with her; if Riku were asleep then I planned to just keep walking with him. However, Akane decided it wasn't worth risking getting stuck in the rain halfway to her Mom's, so she went on the bus and I headed off in the same direction. I wanted to see if I could find my way to that area by remembering which way Ayako drove us the other night. Success! I did it... found a new way to Takashamiya! I think it's faster than the way I have walked before, as I was there in just twenty-five minutes. I hung around the bus area for ten minutes hoping to see Akane, but I didn't, and continued on my walk with Riku. He slept for an hour and fifteen minutes, and I discovered a new area today, walking along some streets off the beaten track. </p>
<p>I took lots of photos of various homes this morning, as I find it quite fascinating that on the same block there can be a very old crumbling falling-down house, deserted (I think!), a tiny and badly maintained home with three layers of boards and flowerpots carefully tended to, a gorgeous modern Japanese-style home beautifully landscaped and a very North American looking boring brick apartment building.</p>
<p>I haven't had an egg salad sandwich here yet (Akane did give me half of one the first week I was here, as the second half was ham), I was hungry from having walked two hours, so talked myself into one from a bakery on the old "Shopping Road" not far from here. Riku woke just as I was eating it (of course!) and decided that yes, he would like to try it. He liked it! and ate half of it. Akane said later that he hasn't liked it up to now so his tastes are changing. When offered more though he said very nicely "No kank you."</p>
<p>Oh, while walking to "Shopping Road" we once again ran into three familiar faces... the nice mom from the playground downstairs with her two year old son in the back baby seat of her bike (we stopped and greeted each other... Riku was still napping), and at the bakery ran into the woman who runs the clothing store downstairs whom Riku always greets. I do take such pleasure in these encounters! Last night when I was downstairs on my own for an hour, I stopped in a shop I had never been in and with her grown son's help (he buys the children's clothing for this shop in NYC twice a year), she told me that she thought my grandson was very beautiful. I guess I am not hard to spot! </p>
<p>It started to rain about three minutes from home; we ran very quickly with Riku helping out by pushing himself back and forth very quickly and laughing away! I took him out of the stroller as soon as we were inside the mall so he could stretch those legs before we got home. I quickly put together his lunch for him.... two leftover dishes that Akane had made yesterday... a bowl each of rice with grated and cooked carrot and sweet potato, and a side dish of the most delicious Chinese veg' and tofu dish... eggplant, green pepper, carrots, and sweet potato. Riku ate both dishes and asked for dessert. I made up a little dish of four sliced strawberries and half a kiwi, all eaten in record time. He had eaten the rest of his toast from breakfast on his walk too, and a tiny iced cookie. We are not sure where Riku is putting all this food lately! </p>
<p>Akane arrived home as I was doing up the dishes, bearing gifts... two roses for me from her mom!, and a nice take-out container filled with the glazed sweet potatoes I have been looking forward to trying. She had bought herself a sushi plate as well, and of course Riku was right up there taking big bites of her nori-wrapped rice with salmon. He drank a big cup of veggie juice too. </p>
<p>He started to show signs of needing his nap, but just as I was tucking him in, Doug called. I had left a message for him to call earlier so it was forty-five minutes later... he was delighted to talk to his Grandpa and then to his Daddy too... although for a couple of minutes, as Bryn was saying "Hi Riku" and asking questions, I am sure that Riku thought it was Doug talking. Their voices are very similar and Riku seemed puzzled as to why he was talking to Grandpa when they had said goodbye already! </p>
<p>Unfortunately, all this excitement, and it now being an hour past the time he should have been napping, it was impossible to get him settled. I tried so hard, and several times he was "this" close but he was really resisting. I gave up, and immediatly took him outside for some fresh air and playtime. Akane was napping when we left. Riku knew it and said "Mommy sleeping. Riku not sleeping. Riku woke up!" Ha! </p>
<p>When we arrived at the playground, we were the only ones there. It was a bit damp from the earlier rain, but this made great packing sand for the "cakes" and "ice cream" balls the children made when they joined us. The twins arrived late; I had thought of my promise to meet them today; they had told Akane they would be out of school earlier today, so I thought I had probably missed them. It was already 4 p.m. They are usually out of school and at the playground at 2:15. However, at 5:15 they came bounding into the playground, shouting out "hi" from way back and waving enthusiastically. Riku had been flirting a bit with a darling one-year-old girl, who arrived just shortly after we did. The grandmother was watching Riku intently, no doubt imagining her little granddaughter doing all these things that Riku was doing, in just another year. He touched her cheek gently, said "Hi baby". wanted her to put her feet on the riding toy, and then went off to walk on the narrow ledge, balancing carefully, twisting himself into the lower three branches of a tree and holding the pose long enough for me to get my camera, and just being his generally good-natured little self. </p>
<p>He was so delighted to have Aya and Yui join him in the sandbox though! They were busy as bees making things with the pails and shovels, and Riku was delighted when three bigger boys joined in for a few minutes... really just hanging around and watching Riku. I heard them say "Americanu", and then look surprised when Riku piped up with his Japanese! The girls said "bye bye" at 5:30 but continued to wave and call out to us from their balcony across the way. </p>
<p>We left at 5:50 and Riku was just wired! He ran and laughed and opened the door with the key, raced into the hallway, was really loud! when he spotted two boys about eight and six, and when we got in the same elevator with them he touched both of them on their cheeks! I don't think this is a typical Japanese child! Akane seemed shocked that he would do such a thing, and it is surprising really. He didn't used to touch strangers so readily.</p>
<p>Akane was up when we arrived home and I told her I wanted to give Riku four-grain cereal for dinner tonight. He hasn't had a BM all day, which is very unusual, nor has he used the toilet once, despite being put on many times. It used to be when Riku was hungry he would demand "yogurt!" It hasn't happened much here as I am very aware of how important those snacks are to his general behaviour... when he's hungry he is demanding! He was up to the table the minute we came in the door.. oh, I put him on the toilet first and washed his hands... and then he called for "dessert!" We told him first comes dinner and he said "No! Dessert!" Riku was a hungry boy apparently! </p>
<p>I quickly washed some strawberries and gave him the little pick he likes to eat his fruit with. "<strong>Oh!</strong> Strawberries!" was my reward. I got the cereal cooked, added one dried apricot cut into tiny bits, dried blueberries, and more fresh strawberries, to make it as enticing as possible. This adult-sized portion was polished off; Akane and I were both surprised. I asked if he was still hungry, or if he was okay, and he said "I still hungry". Out came the second half of a kiwi from this morning and a half piece of buttered whole wheat toast. He nibbled away at that until the plate was empty. I asked if he was still hungry and he replied, "Oh, yes, I still hungry!" I suggested pudding as I hadn't eaten my second tofu pudding yet. "This pudding is yummy!" he said, as it too disappeared. While all this eating was going on, I prepared my own dinner... some sauteed spinach over rice and some peppery gluten I had brought from home. I had no longer sat down beside him (a big mistake!) when Riku said "Oh, I like that!"... and ate not only the few bites of my rice with spinach, and two little bits of the gluten, but also ate a small bowl of rice I got for him, along with some of my spinach! Akane and I just kept staring and staring at his stomach and smiling at each other. Really, where is it going?!  The final straw was my bringing in a small plate with two complete stalks of celery, cut into thirds ... for me. I should have known bettter by now! "Oh, Riku like that!" everything starts with an enthusiastic "Oh!". So I pulled off the strings on the first one, and down it went, after which he helped pull off the strings and ate three more. Akane took a photo of his very large tummy! It is round and hard and oh-so-big!</p>
<p>Riku played with his cars in the kitchen, right in the middle of the very small floor space! while I washed the dishes.</p>
<p>Tub time, hoping it would relax him enough that his bowel would empty before bedtime! No such luck; he had a great time in the tub, tried unsuccessfully once again to go to the bathroom, lay down on the nice mat his Bahbah sent home for him with Akane, while he got rubbed down with lotion and pulled on his own pj bottoms. He takes it very seriously, making sure his feet are through the bottoms before standing up. </p>
<p>As soon as he was ready (his teeth were brushed right after the tub), I said "What time is it Riku?" and his ran running to his mom saying "bedtime!" 8 p.m. Nice! Let's just hope there isn't a very big surprise for his mommy during the night! </p>
<p>It's now 10:30 p.m. and I'm off to bed... tomorrow we may be going to a museum with Ayako and out for an Italian lunch (if Riku's nap works out as we hope), and on Friday Riku is going to the dentist for the first time!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/a_taste_of_italy.html">A Taste of Italy!</a></h2>
								<p>Riku awoke at 6 a.m. today, after going to sleep at 8 p.m. Not bad, but better still was that 7:30 awakening last week! I awoke when he did, but decided to give him some time with his mom while I read and thought about going back to sleep. I gave up at 6:45 and joined them in the dining room. Riku was already busy playing; Akane had made him a boiled egg, some tomato, and toast and he had eaten only half the egg. I'm not surprised; that tummy must still have been pretty darned full after last night! </p>
<p>The plan today was to have lunch with Ayako, and go on to a new museum in Osaka, I believe. I played "kitchen" with Riku after checking my emails, and learning that Don has a job which begins on Tuesday; it's in the investment field, which skills he has picked up on his own over the years. What a good day for him! I know he will enjoy being back out in the work force again, outside the home for a nice change of pace. </p>
<p>Akane sat and played with Riku while I showered, as I know Riku will need his morning nap if we are going to be out for most of the day. At 8:45 a.m. we were in the park, having first stopped to look at a huge "cherry picker" outside the building cleaning windows. I bought Riku a cherry picker as part of his mini vehicles, and he knew they were for fixing wires and cutting trees. I hadn't thought about window cleaning! Later in the day we saw another one with the fellow working on wires overhead so that was perfect timing... two examples in one day. </p>
<p>Riku was very active and busy at the park. There was a group of seniors playing croquet again; I think they are a fairly regular early morning group. Of eight people, only one was a woman, and she was over eighty by the looks of her, very bent over and fragile looking, but also very competent at the game! Riku watched for a bit, but then decided today was the day he was going to go down the slide many many times. I think I mentioned that he had stopped sliding down after my first day or two here, and then went down once last week. Well, he more than made up for it today; down he would go, run around to the ladder, climb up, go immediately down and on and on it went. He wanted me to go down too; I told him to catch me at the bottom, and I wish I could have taken a photo of that little boy at the bottom of the slide holding open his arms! </p>
<p>On one of the last trips down Riku spotted an ant; he does chat to little creatures, and was asking if it wanted to go down the slide. I told him I thought the ant would be frightened, and he bent over and asked "Are you frightened?" He watched it wander around on the little stoop, and a couple of times it started to go down the side where I was watching from. Up it clambered again and Riku's nose was practically on top of it! I told Riku we would put him down in the sand so he could find some food and managed to flick it gently over the side. Riku slid down quickly to see it crawling along a leaf and so we spent a few more minutes watching this busy ant. </p>
<p>I put Riku in the stroller at 9:45, at which point he always, without fail, wants a "snack?" Today it was a container with a few slices of his uneaten banana from breakfast, and four sliced strawberries, then his half slice of toast from breakfast, and a tiny cookie, and the last of the cheddar bunnies, and finally a good portion of dried apricots, cranberries, and dried blueberries. After a big drink of water, he was asleep very quickly... 10:15. It had been a bit cool when we set out, but I took Riku's cotton jacket off before he settled in; the sun was out and hot already! </p>
<p>I do try to find shady streets to walk on, as my arms and hands are getting too brown and I keep forgetting to put sunblock on before I leave the house. Today Riku should have had it on his arms and lower legs too; the house was coolish when we left, so I hadn't thought about it. </p>
<p>I walked all the way to a busy shopping area, as it is an interesting walk along small lanes and then has lots of busy stuff going on once I arrive there. Unfortunately today, I once again ran into the area just as a van with a very loud amplified message (perhaps an election vehicle) drove by; the voice is irritating to start with and the volume is just horrible. Riku was forty minutes into his nap and that was that! He was still tired and despite my getting away from the van as quickly as possible, and into a side street, it was too late; he was awake and obviously not rested. </p>
<p>We got home just after 11 a.m. and Akane told us Ayako would be picking us all up before noon. I automatically went to make Riku something to eat to take with us, but Akane said he would eat pasta and pizza and so I needn't  bother. Yes, we were going out for an Italian lunch; perfect! I was ready for it, after eating only two small pieces of toast this morning with peanut butter, and then a good long walk.</p>
<p>It was 1 p.m. before we were served, Riku immediately ate two small pieces of white bread with herbs, and a stickly sweet fried ball of dough (delicious though!) so he ate only three small bites of pizza and no pasta. This boy needs to eat when he is first hungry; next time we will take along a yogurt (he hadn't had any today) just to make certain there is good food in that tummy before the free appetizers arrive. </p>
<p>Akane had suggested a creamy tomato pasta with mushrooms to me, and it was so very good! We each ordered a different main dish and then shared a margherita pizza, Italian-style, with thin almost cracker-like dough and really tasty tomato sauce with fresh tomatoes and basil. Lunch dishes were served with a small green salad and tea. I enjoyed every bite of mine, as did Akane and Ayako. </p>
<p>We were in a mall with a really wonderfull store called "Moji"; we were at one a few days ago as well... very reasonably priced items, clothing, furniture, paper products, etc., and Akane wanted to stop in for a few things to take home. I bought a small plastic zipped container of thin markers to keep in the car at home for Riku when we go out for a meal, along with a medium sized pad of plain paper to keep with it. I also thought I could use it for the plane trip home, and perhaps with the children in the playground here too. I found a plastic-covered date book, with just the days of the week in it on one side, lined paper opposite and blank pages in the back. Perfect for logging in my doula weeks, as they are not marked with the months or days. </p>
<p>By this time it was evident that Riku needed sleep... soon! He was tearing around the store with Auntie Ayako trying to keep up with him; I thought it was time for me to just wander and let them have the time together. It was fun to hear her calling to him, and really moving with the stroller trying to find him! Just as she caught up with him, he would shriek and set off again. </p>
<p>The next part of the day was to have been the museum, but I personally did not want to even think about trying to keep him not only quiet but happy in that setting. He would have been fine if he could be walked first, as he would have slept through the exhibits, but there wasn't time for that. I suggested that Akane and Ayako go on their own, after dropping me off with Riku somewhere I could walk home from. </p>
<p>Hmm, an Italian lunch; seemed like an Italian dessert would be just the thing, and the ideal spot for me to walk home with Riku afterwards. Akane, Ayako, and Riku all seemed to think that was a good idea too! It was their first time there (the sisters, that is; Riku and I are regulars by now) and the gelato maker himself came out of the glass back room, right over to me, and said something to me in Japanese. He recognized me (Akane said it would be difficult for him not to have!) and wanted me to try his new chocolate gelato; he went behind the counter and gave me a nice big tasting spoon of it, and everyone else too. How could I not get it after that nice gesture? Riku had an all-strawberry one this time although felt quite free to dip into my cup of chocolate more than a few times! Akane had the strawberry as well (it tasted just like crushed strawberries bound with a little cream... soooo good!), and Ayako had a big cone with two flavours... mango and a very yellowy vanilla... French vanilla, no doubt. I had told Akane I really wanted to try the coconut and the custard before I leave... and perhaps I should try the caramel too. Akane kindly told the gal behind the counter about the coconut and custard (I hadn't told her of the caramel), and told her I was leaving soon. She said she was sure the owner would do them up for me, so I must stop in every day before I leave. It really is so very good! I am going to miss it for sure once my walks here are over. </p>
<p>Riku sits so nicely with his cup in hand eating happily away at his treat; he said a very enthusiastic "arigato!" when he left, and we set off for our walk, waving goodbye to his mommy and aunt. Fifteen minutes later he was sound asleep, feet up on the bar in front of him, looking very relaxed. He slept for almost two hours, while I walked and walked and walked some more, up and down every shady side street I could find, and trying very hard to avoid the motorscooter guy delivering papers by stopping his noisy machine every single house down the block! I would turn in another direction to avoid him and five minutes later there he was on that block! </p>
<p>I took Riku right upstairs for an early dinner (it was 5 p.m. by now), and promised him we would go to the playground as soon as he ate. I decided the fastest and healthiest meal for him would be oatmeal with a little four-grain cereal cooked in with it ; I also added those fresh strawberries he is so wild about, one dried apricot in tiny pieces, and four almonds chopped up very finely, as well as the wheat germ and flax seed that always goes into it. Once again I ended up with a huge bowl, put about 2/3 of it in his bowl, and it disappeared, along with the rest of it! I know adults who couldn't eat that much at one sitting! I didn't even offer anything more after that amazing feat. </p>
<p>We got his sand toys, left a note for Akane to join us if she liked, and were in the playground at 5:45. Except for a young couple sitting on a bench, no one was there but us. They left very soon after we arrived but waved and said goodbye to Riku first. I was so happy to see Yui come and play; she had her two-year-old brother with her, and made him bow his head and shoulders at us, by pushing on the top of his head. She was very motherly with him, putting him on the bouncing toys and then carefully lifting him off. Soon Aya joined us too, and they all sat playing in the sandbox. Aya ran upstairs and came running down with her paper and pen, and I too had my new pens and notebook with me. We wrote our names again, and when the older brother joined us, he too wrote his name in English, but with some diffiuculty. I wonder if only the younger children learn English as he seemed to struggle to remember how to do it. </p>
<p>Their dad was home tonight and just before 7 p.m. called them home; Riku and I left soon after that. I didn't expect him to eat much dinner, but knew he needed some veggies; I heated up some new grainy rice that Akane had frozen, added half the package to the leftover Chinese veggie dish from two days ago, and watched in amazement as Riku ate all but two bites of this generous portion of food!... eggplant, sweet potato, tofu, onions, green peppers, and the tomatoes left over from his breakfast. He didn't refuse dessest either... ate six little balls of sorbet Akane buys for him and maybe a quarter of a banana. </p>
<p>Akane arrived home just as he was finishing up his dinner. They had had trouble finding the museum, then couldn't find parking easily, so by the time they got there Ayako had decided to sit in the car and read while Akane dashed in for the thirty-five minutes they were still open. </p>
<p>Riku knows it's bathtime after dinner, so in he went, playing happily for just fifteen minutes tonight; he brushed his teeth (I told him about going to the dentist tomorrow... how he would sit in a big chair, and the dentist would look in his mouth and touch his teeth... Rike repeated at the end of it all... "it's okay" to reassure himself that it would indeed be okay.), got his own pyjama bottoms on and up, and told his mommy it was "bedtime Mommy!" Off he goes wth a kiss on each cheek for his Nana and a big squeeze. Akane said he took about fifteen to twenty minutes to fall asleep... 8:50 tonight... a little later than would be ideal. Akane is enjoying her long quiet evenings in front of the TV these days; I am on her computer of course, but she says she is enjoying it and, from the occasionaly bursts of laughter I hear, I have no reason to doubt her! </p>
<p>One sweet story to tell you tonight... while Riku was sitting in the rocking horse in the playground tonight, he noticed the clouds. I pointed out that there was a huge one, two very long ones, and lots of tiny ones. He pays such attention to this kind of thing... always looks up to see the moon, and has a big smile when he spots it.. Tonight he was looking thoughtful about the clouds and he said to me "Clouds in there.", and I asked, of course, "Clouds in where?". He answered "Clouds in book." Hmmm, so the next obvious question was "Which book?" He thought for a minute and said "Big cloud in Frog and Toad book.", and there is; we've discussed it several times. Frog and Toad are sitting on a rock and there is a big cloud behind them. How he loves being read to!</p>
<p>p.s. for those of you wondering... Riku agreed to sit on the toilet only twice today and not a thing happened! I think the thought of all of this leading to actually having a BM disappear in there was enough to slow down the enthusiasm of a few days ago. We shall just keep asking and not making any fuss about it; he will be ready at some point. </p>
<p>p.s. One last note: Riku now weighs 12.8 on the scale!!! </p>
<p>Night night... 10:20 and I'm off to read and sleep...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/friday_already_and_rikus_first.html">Friday Already! ... and Riku's First Visit to the Dentist</a></h2>
								<p>Riku had dreams twice in the night, and I woke for both of them, going to sleep and having one of my own... thought I had lost the digital camera again! I was awake at 2 a.m. and didn't get back to sleep until after 3 and then woke again when Riku did at 4. I was too warm, tried reading, and was very busy scratching away at my heel on one foot and my bit toe! on the other. I am having a reaction to some bug here! Yikes! I got up to get a cold cloth and slept with it wrapped around my toe with the other foot against it. Ater finally drifting off, heard Riku again at 6 a.m. He came right into my room this morning and so up I got. </p>
<p>Before Riku could ask for yogurt today, I made him a scrambled egg, "bacon", and tomatoes, with a side of toast. He ate everything but some of the toast. "I like this bacon!" said Riku; me too! We read "Are You My Mother?" this morning during breakfast; Riku really pays attention to all the little details, and seems to find something new each time to comment on. Today I asked him if he would like a big worm for dinner, and his answer was "No, too dirty". </p>
<p>I popped into the shower early, with grand plans for the day... a walk and a short nap for Riku, which did happen. A cute thing happened when we were leaving, though; he always says goodbye to Akane, gives kisses, and waves both hands goodbye to her at the door. Today he leaned over to where she was sitting, rubbed her forehead and said to her in Japanese... "feeling good?" Akane smiled at him and said yes, she was. </p>
<p>He often points to all of us and names us... "Mommy", "Nana", "Riku". We walked out to Rainbow City, a huge mall complex with many high-end American chain stores... Timberland and Brook Brothers come to mind. I wanted to buy a nice big pad of drawing paper for Riku like he has here, so that I can keep his drawings in one place. Riku walked, as always, when we first set out at 9 a.m., and a half hour later was sitting happily in his stroller eating strawberries, half a banana, two little cookies, and some crackers. Five minutes after finishing those he was fast asleep, and slept for forty-five minutes. Perfect, as I wanted him to have a long afternoon nap today. He was to have his first appointment with the dentist at 4 p.m. </p>
<p>I bought the pads of paper first, and then we headed immediately upstairs to the second floor toy area. How he loves this place, and once again played with the water wheel set, and ended up playing with a little girl in the same kitchen he has here. They were so darling, both mixing things and one of them pouring tea for the other, opening the oven and dishwasher, sorting out the dishes and cutlery. They were so cute together that I took several photos and got the mom's address so I could send her a couple of the photos if they turn out well. </p>
<p>Riku was upset when we left, and not very pleased with me at all. I knew he was still tired, with that reaction, so decided to feed him before leaving the mall, rather than have him wait until we got home. This way, with a full tummy, he might sleep. I bought a container of strawberry yogurt and a fruit bun, and he ate them both. However, he did not fall asleep as planned; there were just too many interesting things out there to look at today... a big hole being dug, lots of contructions vehicles, an ambulance racing by... so I thought that was fine. He could nap at home instead. </p>
<p>Akane had expected us for lunch and had made a nice big bowl of the same Chinese sweet and sour vegetables we liked so much the other day. She left it on the table for us, set with placemats and bowls, along with freshly cooked rice in the cooker. Riku, to my surprise, ate a good-sized portion of it. I know adults whose entire lunch is a yogurt! I tried very hard to get him settled down for his nap, but he was having none of it... was being so silly and strange... sucking the blanket!, lying on his tummy with his knees pulled up making little eating sounds as though he were a squirrel, with both hands in front of his mouth, and playing with the cord for the lamp behind him... all very unusual things for him to do. He was so close to being asleep three times but never quite made it. </p>
<p>I was very worried he would not be in any mood at all for the dentist.  I did give up finally, as it was soon too late to have him nap anyway. He snuggled in my arms for a bit once we were out of the bedroom. Akane was back from running some errands, and checking out the newly renovated grocery store, and could see that he was a tired boy. I thought some running around time might be good, but Riku wanted to stay home and play with his cars, trucks, and planes.</p>
<p>Akane went out to the bank and Riku did the most interesting thing while we were home for those forty-five minutes. He started listing things, just out of the blue... started with cars, boats, planes, tractors, airplanes, trucks, etc. I joined in and then he switched to kitchen items... forks, bowls, spoons, pots, and so we went, on and on until he switched again... it was fascinating as he really was enjoying it and leading it as well. We took turns saying new words and it was most amazing to see how many words he knows! What fun this was! He ended it all with a list of all the people in his world... Mommy, Daddy, Nana, Grandpa, Auntie Kelly, Brent, Mykayla, Caillie, etc. etc., through the whole family, with me adding all the aunts, Uncle Frank, Tessa, Andrea, and the other cousins and uncles too. All very important to him obviously! </p>
<p> I washed his hair and once again went over what was going to happen at the dentist. I did this several times yesterday and today; I did the same with Kelly and Bryn and it seems to help a lot with new experiences. </p>
<p>The visit went without a hitch! He balked at first at sitting in the big chair, but I sat down on it and pulled him onto my lap to show him it was fine. The dentist and his assistant said I could stay there with him on my lap, and so I did; it worked beautifully, as they put a big bib on him, as I had told him, asked him to open his mouth wide, which he did several times for them with no hesitation at all, let the gal brush his teeth, and then chose "orange!" for his floride treatment. He can't spit yet but did lean over the little sink several times, made a good spitting sound, and said "spit!" </p>
<p>Riku was more than ready for some running-around time (this is why I think he had trouble sleeping... too long in the stroller... a half hour each way, and then not enough time at the store or outside), so his mommy, he, and I headed for the park. First however, Akane stopped to buy a couple of dresses for Misa in the same place I went to the other evening; the fellow who owns it and his mother were there and she was so happy to talk to Akane and tell her how cute Riku is... she had had her son tell me that the other day. And while continuing down the shopping centre towards the park, Riku popped in to see the two very friendly women who make such a fuss over him each time they see him. He went right into the store, to say "good afternoon" in Japanese to them and pulled up his shirt to show them his big tummy too! Akane came up at that point, and since they hadn't met her before, they stood and chatted for a bit while Riku and I waited at the park. He was really itching to get there! </p>
<p>We wandered over to the sandbox/slide area, but nothing much was going on there, so we decided to go to the playground instead. Perfect choice, as there were about eight young children playing there. Riku was happy to sit in the sandbox for the longest time, but eventually got up and joined in some of the running around, playing on the spring toy he likes and peddling in one of the children's little push/peddle cars. Akane went up to put her packages away and came down with my water, sitting there with me for a while. The bugs here are terrible right now! We could see hundreds of them in the light, but worse are the quite small mosquitos, which bite without your noticing them. Now I have about eight sites that can easily drive me mad with scratching! And I know I shouldn't touch them but even the blanket or my sandals touching an area can irritate it.. and so it begins! I am red, swollen, and itchy and would happily complain about this for a few paragraphs! Akane said the bugs here in the summer really are terrible and she kindly commiserated with me. Riku was bitten too, but so far hasn't scratched. </p>
<p>Akane left after a while, not feeling great, and I hung out with Riku as long as there were children there. He was really enjoying himself and I knew he needed the time outdoors. I had offered him a "little snack" at the playground (his container of apricot pieces, blueberries, and cranberries), and he sat up on the bench with us to eat all but a dozen tiny blueberries! This is a hungry boy again... </p>
<p>Home at 6:30; I made him another adult-sized bowl of porridge, with fresh strawberries and very finely chopped almonds in it. He ate every single bite of it... always amazes me! And oh yes, he would like a banana, and oh yes, he would like some ice cream too... sorbet actually. At one point, while this was being discussed, he called out to Akane "<strong>Dessert!</strong>" .. she just wasn't bringing on that ice cream fast enough! He topped all of this off with two vegetable 'cookies', both sesame seed... and juice and water. I look at that belly of his and wonder why it doesn't pop! </p>
<p>Bathtime followed with the usual routine... wash in the sink and play time in the tub. Riku sat on the toilet three times today, all successful. Whew! We're back in business. However, just as I was about to get him out of the tub tonight he made it clear that something was about to happen.. a BM. I quickly wrapped a towel around him and dashed off into the toilet room next door; he seemed quite willing to sit there and try, but nothing happened immediately and he wanted off. Off he got. I told him I would get a diaper so he could have a BM in his diaper. "Okay" he said. However, I wasn't quite fast enough... seconds only! ... but he pointed to a small mound on the hallway floor! "BM there." Yes, indeed. Akane cleaned it up and I put the diaper on him. We didn't tuck him in immediately as we knew he had been interrupted from his task, but after almost a half hour nothing more had happened. </p>
<p>Riku was so obviously tired and more than ready for his bed. He has become used to this bath time and then immediately into bed routine that I think that he expects it now... no side trips to play, no stories, just right into bed. Off they went at 8:20, and at 9:30 Akane carried a boy in here with a dirty diaper. He slept through the change, I carried him back to bed, and left the room immediately. </p>
<p>That's it for me... it's 9:45 p.m. and I am heading to bed. Tomorrow is going to be busy... lunch out with Mrs. Goda and our crew here, to a Japanese restaurant with wonderful vegetable tempura, and then a visit to a Japanese garden following lunch. </p>
<p> I do have lots of emails to answer but no energy tonight and it was a light email day today anyway...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/and_saturday_flies_by.html">And Saturday Flies By!</a></h2>
								<p>Our little fellow woke up at 6:30 this morning; I heard him playing in the dining room/living room, so decided to stay in bed and read for a bit. I was awake in the night, scratching once again! Akane told me tonight that one of the first words Bryn learned in Japan was the world for mosquito, and I know why! </p>
<p>I quickly checked my emails, although had nice long ones from Gail and Doug to read this morning, so did that before sitting on the floor to play with Riku. He has been doing a funny thing the last couple of days; he will come to me and say "TV?" I always look at him and say "TV???? Noooo, you are just bored! How about making me some porridge (or tea, or whatever)?", and off he goes. I think he just wants a suggestion of something better to do as he never asks twice! Today he was busy making me an egg (Akane had bought him a very lifelike hard boiled play egg), so he cut it in two and gave us each half.  We also had porridge, toast, and tea, and changed utensils several times. He would give me a blue fork, reach over and take it back, saying "Oh, sorry", and give me a red one! He is quite the little Canadian; someone will bump into him and he automatically says "Oh, sorry!"</p>
<p>I was in the shower very early, as we were out the door at 9 a.m. to the park. Akane did some laundry, and showered while we were out. We did our usual wander over to the quiet park, Riku pushed the walk button in both directions, and we checked out the sandbox for other children. No one there today, so I thought we would go to the "Shopping Road" to buy something to soothe these bites of mine and Riku's. He hasn't started scatching yet, but his are quite large and I imagine they will be itching at some point. </p>
<p>Just as we were leaving, a little girl and her mom showed up; Riku immediately changed directions and went right over to her. Once again, it was so sweet to see; these two little ones playing together so very nicely, with Riku handing over some of his best stones (his little stash of "'tones and 'ticks" are still where he left them a few days ago) while she handed them every so nicely back! I indicated to her mom, after a bit of "chatting", that Riku and I both had bites; she went into her bag and offered up some roll-on cream. I used it on Riku's bites and asked if she would write it down for me; I planned to just show this to the pharmacist. The child will be two in June and despite the language problem we were still able to ask and answer some questions about the children and where we live. Everyone understands "Canada" and "San Francisco". Eventually another girl Riku's age joined them while they sat on a bench and had their drinks. </p>
<p>We were scheduled to meet Akane at 10:20, and I wanted us both to go to the toilet before heading off to Mrs. Goda's. I hadn't planned any stops along the way, but the two women in the clothing store spotted us and came scooting out to say "ohayo" to us. Of course they know we are leaving soon, and the owner wanted to take Riku's photo. She took a couple, one with him pulling one of his new and very funny faces, and another with a smile. I took one of them both with Riku as well. I think it will be fun to remind Riku of these new acquaintances of his. </p>
<p>Now we were really dashing, but it was worth the trip as Riku once again went to the bathroom. He is very willing today and says "OK" each time I ask him. I think a BM is not far off, if this is kept up. Riku sits quite comfortably on the toilet and is willing to sit just a little longer each time. </p>
<p>Akane had lost track of the time, so was ten minutes late coming down. It was already warm out, and we set off at a good pace towards her mom's, arriving just ten minutes late. Riku had fallen asleep after his usual stroller snack. Today's consisted of orange sections, and a few apple slices, then half a slice of buttered toast and one cookie, and he had the dried fruit for later on in the day. We reached the Goda's before Riku woke up, so I found a shady street and walked up and down until Akane and her mom joined us. Riku woke just a minute before this, so the timing was perfect, a fifty minute nap. </p>
<p>We walked quite a good distance to the restaurant, "cutting" through a park, although with Riku with us it took longer to go through the park than if we had gone around it... all those sticks and rocks to collect! Today Riku found a great piece of branch with bark peeling from it and a curved and quite long stick. He is so very willing to find a good place to leave these treasures; I tell him we have to find a good place for them, and he starts looking around. Today it was under a "big tree!" and he left them there happily. Riku is such an easygoing little boy (except when he is overtired or hungry, that is, and I've been working hard to avoid either situation). </p>
<p>The restaurant Mrs. Goda chose was really lovely. We sat at a big table with room underneath for our bare feet, and Riku was sitting beside me on a large cushioned platform. He had a window to look out of, and lots of room to wriggle about in, and then lots of shrimp to eat as well! Mrs. Goda had arranged for me to have a vegetarian plate of tempura, although it did have two battered shrimp on it. Riku was more than happy to eat them (although I did snap off those tails first!) and then ate the tiny shrimp on our appetizer plates too. He ate two tiny baby corn cobs, quite a few of my cold thin noodles, a bit of rice, and a little tofu and veg' that Akane had packed up. I had ordered the yam rice as it sounded intriguing but unfortunately was served with an undercooked egg in the middle of the sauce I was to pour over it. Even though Akane took the egg out, the somewhat slimy tecture of the yams was just a little too close to the uncooked whites I had seen hanging about! I am really sqeamish about undercooked eggs. The tempura was light and delicious; Mrs Goda ordered me extra so I had a wonderful mushroom, a long asparagus stalk, a very generous piece of kabocha squash, and a very mild chunk of onion.... so good! Akane traded her ginger rice with shredded tofu for my untouched rice dish; it was delicious. We had hot tea, and cold water, both of which hit the spot as we sat there enjoying the leisurely pace of our lunch. Riku played with the container of toothpicks and nibbled away until he was ready to move on. </p>
<p>Our after-luncheon tea was served in a very large and comfortable room next door. We sat on leather chairs and had a cup of very good tea. Riku had been served his own iced tea in the restaurant and did he ever enjoy it! He kept repeating "This is <strong>my</strong> tea" and drinking away at it steadily. He also took big sips of his Baba's iced tea in the next room. He and I went off to the toilet, Japanese style this time, and Riku went too. I am so glad he doesn't mind going in public bathrooms as some children do. He went running in to his Baba saying "I went on toilet!" in English, but she understood him well enough; toilet is the same word or at least there are almost always signs that say "TOILET" in English. </p>
<p>The best part of lunch for Riku was the very large and real buffalo head in the lobby! He went running after his Baba when she went to the bathroom first and came running back to us, saying "Big! big "Come see. Big!" and was it ever! He wanted to be picked up to touch it, and of course he could only reach as far as the chest. He really wanted to touch the horns, but that would have required a ladder! The hostess was quite taken with Riku; she said that most children are afraid of it, and was amazed by his interest and enthusiasm. </p>
<p>Mr. Goda had been called to pick us up and go with us to a City Garden Store, which none of them had been to before. They had beautiful flowering bonsai on display and three tanks of fish which Riku would have liked to have visited with all afternoon. He and I hung back and looked at the tiny fish darting back and forth; I think he needs a goldfish at home. </p>
<p>We all wandered around looking at whatever interested us, and for Riku that meant exploring all the different pathways he could find, especially if it meant he could lose track of us! I was kept very busy! However, the nicest part of this day was seeing Riku reaching out to take the hand of a very elderly woman who was walking along with a large group of senior citizens. Many of them were in wheelchairs, and most of the others had canes, but this woman was managing on her own. Another woman had reached out to take Riku's hand, but he didn't see her and took the other woman's. She was so obviously the object of envy as every one of them were watching and oohing and ahhing over Riku. It was the sweetest thing to see. I did get a photo of them from the back. </p>
<p>Oh, important item... I asked Akane to ask her Mom for a suggestion for the bites. She told her the very same name as the gal at the park had recommended. I tried to buy some when I went in to buy another set of batteries, but no luck. Mrs. Goda had her husband stop at a pharmacy and came out with a tube for me and one for Riku, a child's version. Yahoo! Smells like camphor, very familiar. I put it on both of us immediately as Riku had started scratching the large one on his upper arm. </p>
<p>We left there to go to the Japanese Garden; Mr. Goda dropped us off and we walked a bit into the loveliest garden... very traditional Japanese garden, with the requisite waterfalls, beautifully placed rocks and stones, bridges over rushing waters, beautifully landscaped garden areas, and resting areas with benches; we started the walk off with green Japanese tea, the thick foamy traditional tea. I enjoyed it very much although I wasn't sure I was going to. Riku enjoyed the three little cookies served with it! ... and he liked the bit of tea that I gave him at the end of my first cup. Mrs. Goda ordered me a second cup after seeing that I enjoyed it. We were sitting outside on benches, beside a pool filled with koi, being fed by visitors. The woman who served us tea bowed first and gave me the most beautiful of the three bowls of tea; she "presented" it to me, but first turned the bowl around so I could admire its design. It was casual but lovely in this perfect setting. </p>
<p>Riku was off and running as soon as the cookies were gone. What a time he had here! I was expecting him to crash at any moment, but he was obviously so very happy wandering around at his own pace (we were always far behind Akane and her mom). You can't imagine how many wonderful stones there are in a Japanese garden! He loved the stone bridges and rocky pathways and on the narrow or high ones you could hear him say "It's okay, it's okay" and it always was. He is getting very independent about walking down steeper steps now, but is still that cautious "first born" child... unlike Amelia, who has no fear whatsoever! </p>
<p>Just toward the end of our very long time here, Riku did wear down at last. He threw a stone and was ready for the stroller, although he didn't think he was. I gave him his dried fruit snack and a big drink of water, along with my last three little cookies from tea. He was almost asleep as we walked to the train station, but roused as he heard the train come in; he could have used a wee "toes-up" but it didn't happen. </p>
<p>Mrs. Goda said goodbye at the first stop and we got off at home at the second. I had Riku walk as soon as we were in the station; he was quite annoyed that two women were standing by the end of the railing he had been trailing his hand along all along that walk. He stood beside them saying "No woman, no woman" but of course they had no idea what he was implying, which was to get out of his way! Yes, Riku was very tired and it was showing. </p>
<p>I knew he was hungry; he had been so very busy and had been awake too long, which requires more food than usual. I suggested some quiet TV for him, while I made his whole wheat macaroni (that great Kraft dinner substitute) with spinach, mushrooms, and fresh tomatoes, but he had eaten a side dish of cherry tomatoes while he waited. Give him a pick and something to pick up with it, and he is a happy boy for a while. It was just 4:30 at this point, and we had had lunch at noon, but he ate a full bowl of dinner, asked for yogurt, ate all of that, and then ate 98% of my wonderful tofu pudding. </p>
<p>Of course, on my mind all day was how to fit in the gelato visit! The owner had promised to make both custard and coconut and we leave in three days... and they are closed on Monday. I thought that Akane and her mom would be going on to visit Mrs. Goda's mother after the garden, but that has been postponed until tomorrow. It was just too late. So, my plan was to have an early dinner, get Riku into the tub immediately (although I did sit and watch some of "A Bug's Life"  with him on my lap... he likes to talk about "What is happening?"). He wasn't too happy to stop watching until I told him that we were going to go for gelato after the tub. First that ever-important visit to the toilet; another successful visit, and it was obvious he had to have a BM. He really rushed in after his now ritual toilet pattern.... he has to open the door himself first, then turn on the light (nothing cuter than watching that naked little body strettttching up to get that light switch on!), then he <strong>has</strong> to put the lid up... if it's up, then he puts it down and lifts it himself (it's obvious he is not impressed with whomever left it up!... "<strong>Oh</strong>, seat <strong>up</strong>!") and then, and only then can he be lifted up on the toilet. When he is finished "shake, shake, shake!" I get him down, he immediately puts the seat lid down, flushes the toilet, stretches way up to wash his hands in the tiny sink behind and above the toilet, first one and then the other, and dries them on the towel which we moved so he could reach it. Then he leaves, shutting the door first!, and then turning off the light. Quite the procedure here, and it never varies! </p>
<p>I didn't put his diaper on, as he said he had to have a BM, and he sat on the chair, watching a bit more of the movie, Both of us thought he was going to go on the toilet as he seems ready; even being willing to sit without the diaper on was a great sign, but alas nothing happened tonight. I imagine it is going to before morning, but not on the toilet. (Sorry about all this bathroom detail, but it's what is happening in our lives right now!) </p>
<p>So, in he went, with both the cloth frog and the rubber duck having BMs on various tub toys... another good sign. Akane went out to buy a book for her sister, and we agreed to meet downstairs at 6:50. Riku played in the tub until 6:35, and went to the bathroom again; I put on all his various creams and dressed him again. Off for gelato! Riku wanted to walk again but we wouldn't have made it there before closing at the rate we were going; Akane carried him for a bit and then I took over. He is building up my bones for me, this boy!... 12.8kg tonight! We talked about how many stores were closed, how dark it was getting, and how we had to hurry so the man wouldn't lock the store. "No man lock 'tore! Man open door. No close!" </p>
<p>The owner himself was serving the gelato tonight; he greeted us warmly and had made the custard gelato for me, promising the coconut tomorrow. Akane says I am getting special treatment, and I guess I am. He gave me a sample of his black cherry gelato, and it was soooo good, but so was the custard. Akane suggested I have both for only 80 yen (pretty much 80 cents as well) more so I did. However, the double is usually served in a cone and I don't care for cones, so he made an exception and piled up a cup with a very generous amount of both! Riku has his regular strawberry sorbet, with a very generous foray into both of my flavours and so didn't finish his own tonight. He really liked the big black cherry I gave him. So, now I have to get back there tomorrow.... </p>
<p>It was very dark walking home; Riku's eyes were almost closed just as we reached our "big bulding!", and so I lifted him up and gave him the key. Poor wee tyke could hardly manage to keep those eyes open. I wish I had just put him in his pjs before we left; he wasn't thrilled about changing, but did go to the bathroom again, and I brushed his teeth. He ran right into the bedroom and lay down on his pillow, waiting for his mom to brush her teeth and wash. I sang to him a little bit until she arrived. Tucked in at 8:10 ... asleep by 8:30. </p>
<p>A little side note... keep intending to mention a little game that Riku and I play now, and have for several days. I ask as we are leaving the elevator coming upstairs, if he wants to go to the left or the right. He usually chooses right, and off we go in different directions to our front door. He races and races to beat me there and the last corner he turns he is squealing with determination to beat me! It is hilarious. I often make my feet sound as though I am running to make it even more exciting.... </p>
<p>Always while strolling, Riku will ask me to "sing song about farm and a chicken"... and into Old MacDonald I go.... may have mentioned this before... but Bryn, you must remember this so you know what to sing! </p>
<p>... and a last note for tonight. Riku likes to identify people as they come into the elevator; there are times I really hope they don't speak English. Last week a teenager with long hair got in and Riku pipes up "woman in there" and an older man got on next, with a bad wig I think, and again "woman in there". Sometimes he says "that a man" or "that a big boy" ... but he's not always right. It is difficult at times, I can see.... some girls have short hair and some boys have long... confusing when one is just two years old. </p>
<p>Tomorrow ... a hair cut for Riku! Not something he is looking forward to; we will do a little playacting tomorrow and see what we can do about this. We will have the morning and early afternoon at home together while Akane and her mom visit with their grandmother/mom. </p>
<p>Time is 10:10... night night!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/a_rainy_day_and_a_hair_cut_too.html">A Rainy Day... and a Hair Cut Too</a></h2>
								<p>Last night was not a good one for sleeping; I did however get lots of reading done and heard Riku cry out at 2 a.m. He went right back to sleep and woke at 6:15... a good (almost) ten hours sleep for him. I got out of bed immediately; he needed a diaper change and told me about it. Akane was up soon after. Today I asked Riku if he would like an egg, porridge, or yogurt and his answer was porridge. He ate a huge bowl and then said he would have some toast as well. I put a slice of his favourite "bacon" on the plate too and it disappeared first. </p>
<p>I was in the shower early and when I came out, Riku was watching "A Bug's Life". I sat with him on my lap and we watched a bit of it together until my breakfast. We also had time for "Frog and Toad are Friends" and "Small Pig", while I ate the breakfast potatoes Akane had cooked up for me. Riku told me he next wanted the book with the "baby crying", a Japanese board book. I went through the pages with him, but didn't see a crying baby. I asked him where it was and he took the book from me, flipped the pages from the back to the front and showed me the crying baby. He knows his books, this boy! </p>
<p>Just an aside... Riku is always a little worried when he hears a baby or child crying; he cranes his neck around to see where it is and likes to see a mommy or daddy "fit it". When he sees a baby or slightly older child crying now he often says "baby tired", after he heard Akane and me talking about a child in a restaurant a few days ago. He is going to be a good daddy; he picks up these things quickly. </p>
<p>One thing I did this morning with Riku was to bring one of his sandals into the dining room and show him how to "thread" the two straps into the plastic guide. He really wants to learn, and pays such close attention. I showed him twice and then he wanted to do it; it was a bit of a struggle as the guide is not very thick and the strap just fits into it but he did it. And when we were leaving the house, Riku sat down and got right to it; it was harder, too, as his foot was now in the sandal but he twisted around and figured out how it had to be done. He never ever wants anyone to take his sandals or shoes off, or to undo the laces or straps. Each night he pulls on his own pj bottoms too, and the next step it to buy him pj's or shirts with big buttons and buttonholes. He's ready for this for sure. </p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Goda were to pick Akane up between 9:30 and 9:45 this morning for the trip to Osaka to see Akane's grandmother. She is not well enough to have Riku running about her room, so he and I were in the park at 9:25 a.m. It was a very cloudy, overcast, gray day which meant the park was almost deserted. After five minutes, though, a little girl Riku's age (she will be three one month later than Riku) showed up, and the two of them had such a fun time at the fountain. Riku was leaning way over, although not with his knees up, and this little girl did everything he did, including the running around the fountain, being very loud! and throwing themselves at a new area, with hands dangling in the water. </p>
<p>I had bought batteries yesterday for my camera and they were already depleted after twenty or so photos by late afternoon. I am so disappointed I didn't get a photo of these two children together. Riku had headed up a hill on his own, collecting stones, and the other child went off in another direction. I think Riku was quite surprised she wasn't right behind him, so he went off to her area to play. It started to rain, unfortunately, as we all four stuck it out for about fifteen minutes before heading indoors to the mall. I managed to have a fellow help figure out the battery problem so that was a relief. I really would have been so disappointed not to have photos of my last two days here. </p>
<p>Up to the apartment for a nap for Riku; he had a snack and a story first, and off we went. He slept for an hour, which was fine; I imagine he will catch a few winks later on when we are out in the afternoon. We were catching a train at 3:07 to meet Akane for Riku's haircut. When he woke up he was "hungry!". Me too! Akane had left a bowl of my favourite sauteed lotus root on the table and Riku and I shared that before our main course. Yummy! Riku had a big bowl of pasta with extra spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes;  I finished up the last of the ginger "chicken" I had brought with me, covered with sauteed spinach and mushrooms. Akane had also made up a potato salad before she left (she was just leaving as we came in at 11 a.m.), trying to use up some of the large amount of fresh veggies we still have on hand. It hit the spot and Riku had some apple slices for dessert. </p>
<p>I washed Riku's hair, and he sat in a chair while I pretended to cut his hair again; I think he has it down now. He says "Riku not cry" and "It's OK, woman cut hair, it's OK". "Riku happy!" He was delighted to see there was some strawberry gelato left from last night; he smiled with every bite of it.  </p>
<p>Off to the train station, with Riku in his stroller and armed with our rain coats. Everything went as planned and Akane was just where she was supposed to be at the end of this trip of ours. We walked about fifteen minutes to her hairdresser and it went oh-so-well! Riku sat in the chair the entire time, didn't shed a tear, despite a lot of hair falling on his face and bothering his eyes and nose. He had been given a squirt bottle with water in it, and that certainly kept him occupied! Since I was within very close range, holding his head a bit more still, or cupping his chin up or down, I was a little damp at the end of this cut; he mostly did squirt it at the mirrors though. Riku's hair is as short as it has ever been cut, and my, what a handsome boy he is! His bangs are very short and the close cut made the most sense going back to San Francisco. I hope that Akane will get a photo up tomorrow, possibly to send out. </p>
<p>I took off his shirt, we got a damp cloth and wiped down his face, neck, back, and tummy. Akane and the hairdresser both worked on getting as much of the hair off his shirt as they could, and off we went for the train, homeward bound. </p>
<p>Akane had made reservations for us at a Chinese restaurant she likes very much in this neighbourhood. Riku had some yogurt to tide him over, while we waited for our vegetarian prepared "country" meal. It was so very good, every bite of it. We had bok choy to start, with a couple of other veggies in the dish. Riku liked it a lot and ate a generous amount of it. But the noodle dish was his favourite... long, thin noodles with yet more veggies, and a delicious "gravy" to top it off. There was also a tofu dish, which was very very tasty as well. I enjoyed it so much and it was a great way to finish off our day. Akane drew some wonderful creatures for Riku when he had had his fill... a perfect little fish, a tiny octopus, a great little turtle, and the most amazing dragon, none larger than an inch long or wide. Then she cut them out carefully and handed them to Riku as she finished them. </p>
<p>Riku had been "drawing" on the little piece of paper in Akane's notebook. She had, on another day, drawn a few things... a heart, a fish, a couple of animals I think, and tonight Riku, starting with the fish, drew a circle around each one of them, totally enclosing each one individually in one stroke... not circles, but ponds, we were told. We were impressed. </p>
<p>It was pouring rain when we stepped out at 7 p.m. I still had to get to the gelato place, as the owner had said he would make coconut gelato for me. I was awfully tempted not to venture any further in the rain, but knew I would regret letting him down. He is closed tomorrow and we leave on Tuesday, so this really was my last chance to get in there. Akane brought Riku back to the apartment, I borrowed her umbrella and ventured off into the dark and stormy night. Actually, it was quite mild and I do enjoy walking in the rain, once I get out in it. It is a very fast ten or twelve minute walk and I was warm when I got there; it stopped raining at the door too, so it must have been in the cards to go tonight. </p>
<p>I believe the owner's wife was behind the counter tonight; it was the first time I had seen her there, but the owner immediately came out to say hello. I poured my change out on the counter to make sure I had enough for three cups; I used the last of my bills on a train pass today. I had enough... phew! I ordered the coconut, of course, Akane had chosen mango tonight, and Riku's is a given... strawberry. <br />
The owner speaks a bit of English and I confirmed that I was a Canadian, that I live in San Francisco, as does my grandson and his mom, and my son. He told me he hoped we would meet again, and I reassured him I would no doubt see him in December. Then he told me he had given me a gift... a container of his apple gelato! What a lovely man he is. I told him I had meant to bring my camera so I could take his photo; he bowed and said he was honored. It was all quite wonderful and I too hope I get to see him again and eat more of his delicious gelato! </p>
<p>Riku was watching some of his delayed "Bug's Life" when I walked in. No bath tonight, or even a sink bath for the very first time since I arrived. He probably needed it too, as I'm sure there are a few loose hairs hanging about. I intended to eat only half of my coconut treat, but it was far too good to put off! Akane was much more disciplined, and will be enjoying more of her mango tomorrow. Riku sat happily eating and watching TV, taking his own little bites and refusing any help with holding the container or spooning it out. </p>
<p>Just at that point, Akane's dad arrived bearing ice cream!... packed in dry ice. Riku fed Jiji some of his strawberry dessert (what a suprise; he doesn't usually like to share his favourite foods!) and then the two of them sat down to explore the wonders of dry ice. I took lots of photos of them, as Riku was quite intrigued and ended up stirring it up with a whisk and then a big serving spoon from his kitchen. That lasted quite a while, and when it was done, Jiji put on his favourite TV show. Riku was fascinated... swords and loud voices and "woman angry" and "man angry"... he couldn't take his eyes off it; I was hoping no one would get his head lopped off, as it was going in that direction. We have had no "kung fu" moves around here lately and I'd like to see that continue! </p>
<p>Just in the nick of time, Akane's aunt, uncle, and cousin Chika, came in for a visit. I had managed to pull Riku away from the TV for teeth brush and pjs so he would be all ready for bed when they left. They arrived just before 8:30, and stayed only a half hour. Perfect, really, as Riku was going on only a one-hour nap after a very busy day. It would be a shame to have it end in tears. They are a very warm and loving family; they were all down on the floor with Riku, laughing at all his many antics (the latest seems to be showing off his big belly to anyone who pays any attention at all to him!), watching him play with his toys, and chatting with him. Akane and I both took photos. Jiji had left about fifteen minutes earlier, with kisses on both cheeks from Riku, and a big squeeze. We won't likely see him again this trip. </p>
<p>Riku and I had time for a Franklin book, and then another while Akane brushed her teeth and washed; she was on her way to bed with him too. He went over to choose one; he picked up a board book and said, "Oh! This is a good one. Let's read this!" That was quite a sentence but then every day I marvel at how much he has learned and is learning. Akane says it is also true for his Japanese; that each day he has learned new words or expressions. The most amazing thing of all is the ease with which he switches back and forth between them, always using English for me and almost always using Japanese with his mom... and for those in the elevators... it varies. He tries both and often says "bye bye" or "sorry" in English. </p>
<p>He was tucked in at 9:20, and I do hope that he manages to sleep past his 6-ish waking tomorrow... he needs some extra hours tonight. I'm off to read myself to sleep.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/last_day_in_japan_for_this_tri.html">Last Day in Japan ... for this trip</a></h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 6:15 this morning, a little too early for last night's late-to-bed time, but he was happy to be up and about, as was I. I popped into the shower early as I wanted to get Riku out to the park asap. And how happy I am that I did; we had such a wonderful time there. But, I digress... first came a huge bowl of Riku's breakfast request for porridge. I have been adding a finely chopped apricot, some cranberries, and just this past few days some very finely minced almonds, for extra protein for him. He just wolfs it down although this morning ate toast with it too, so we saved the rest of the porridge for his mid-morning snack. He wanted his mom to clean his kitchen today! ... asked her while I was sitting at the table with her, but they ended up doing it together. Much better training! </p>
<p>Back to the park; we arrived at 9:10 today. It was cool and quite windy so it was pretty empty. Riku was disappointed not to see some childen there. I told him maybe they were napping and he said "No children napping", quite sternly. Eventually a little boy showed up and they tossed and kicked a ball around for a bit. By 10 a.m. he was quite ready to go in his stroller for a snack, having checked out both his stone and stick stashes, and taken a couple of trips down the slide. He has been working hard at putting just one foot on each step going up, but the steps are steep and it's a bit of a stretch for him. He is persevering though... </p>
<p>Riku had his snack in hand in the stroller when I spotted the little girl he had played with yesterday. My camera wasn't working then, and I was so sorry I hadn't a photo of them together as they seem so compatible. They both collect stones for instance... very important. </p>
<p>The mom seemed happy to see us too and the two children instantly raced over to the fountain, continuing where they left off yesterday. Lots of photos today, and her mom, Kei, and I got to know each other a bit. She speaks a little English and told me her husband speaks it very well. </p>
<p>I told her we were leaving tomorrow and she said she was very sad, as she too thinks the children play so well together. They certainly do; it's just so adorable to see them together. She took some photos and said she was sorry she hadn't known we would be there as she would have liked some video of them together. It was hard to get photos of them, as her daughter Tomoha is a mover! </p>
<p>While the children were playing, the man with the two dogs whom Riku and I see each time we are in the park was busy taking lots of photos of them but mostly of Riku, and of Riku interacting with two smaller dogs he had with him today. He showed me one very good shot and I asked him if he had email. Unfortunately not. Ah well, I thought, at least he has good taste! </p>
<p>So, the children ran up a hill and collected more stones, and down some steep but wide steps on their own, where they found a treasure lode of even more stones! Riku went off on his own for a bit to visit with the woman who is also there each morning with her dog. They had quite a long visit; Riku inspected her small dog's nails, got thoroughly licked and enjoyed it, identified the dog as being a male dog!, and spoke both Japanese and English to the owner who speaks English quite well. Riku was kissing the dog on his head and patting away; this is the most attention I have seen him give one dog, and I think it was because he was so very gentle... no jumping or nipping. </p>
<p>Kei and I exchanged email addresses and regular addresses as well; we will keep in touch for certain and the next time I am back here with Riku we can give her a call and get the children together. Kei is 37 years old and Tomoha will be three on December the 16th. She suggested we find someone to take our photos together with the children, which we did. </p>
<p>A bit later the kind man with the dogs and the camera came up to me and gave me a print of Riku! It is just gorgeous, a large and beautiful photo of Riku's face peeking out from under his hat. I was so touched and so thankful. He bowed and said "you're welcome" and left. Not too long after that I tried to find him, thinking that I should have had his photo for Riku but he had gone. </p>
<p>Before Kei left, though, she was chatting with him (Riku was busy with the woman and I hadn't noticed him coming back) and said he had asked her to find out if I could possibly be at the park in the morning; they all knew by then that we are leaving for SF in the afternoon. I said I could be there with Riku at 8:30 and he bowed once again, thanked me and left. Kei said he has another photo he would like to give to me. How wonderful is this? Kei gave my hand a squeeze when she said goodbye and hoped that we would meet again in December. </p>
<p>Riku was reluctant to leave at 11:30 when they did, but he was obviously worn out from all his running and collecting... into the stroller he went with his tiny fruit container first... some orange segments and six apple slices, followed by his toast and one cookie snack. Just as we were leaving the large courtyard area, a group of maybe thirty pre-school children went by us in a line. One of the little girls recognized us from the playground downstairs and called out a big "<strong>Hi!</strong>" to us. I gave a big wave and "<strong>Hi!</strong>" back to her and soon we had all thirty children waving and calling out "hello"s and "hi"s to us; it was just too cute for words and the teachers were beaming away. I bowed to them and they all bowed back to me. Riku was delighted, as was I. It felt like a real goodbye from Japan. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep in less than five minutes after that, toast container slipping out of his hand. He slept for two solid hours! while I walked up and down the same shady street, quite a long one, thank goodness. Too bad the gelato place was closed! </p>
<p>I was so hungry by this time... four plus hours of solid walking and I was happy when Riku awoke and I could head home. We walked in the door and Riku said "Lunch!" Yes, sir. We had talked about what he would have on the way home, and had decided on eggs and "bacon" and tomatoes and toast. However, sitting on the table was a small but generous bowl of a mixed rice and vegetable dish Akane had made for us, and a big one for me. We both ate every bite of it; it was delicious. Riku had some cherry tomatoes after that, and then more toast. He is an eating machine these days! For dessert (which he tried to talk me into before his lunch), he had his leftover gelato and some of the very tasty apple gelato, my gift from last night. It was very good but not as creamy (read, not high fat) as the coconut or custard.</p>
<p>Arggh! I just deleted the rest of this blog! I was completely finished, went to add one more comment, and somehow managed to wipe it all out, despite having done not only a "save" but a "copy" as well! I am tired, it's almost 11 p.m., and I should be in bed reading, but I cannot leave this to finish in three weeks when I am home again! </p>
<p>Akane had found the "Franklin" book that she left here last trip; we discovered it on Riku's table and he was so happy to see it. We read it over lunch and then again after lunch. By then Riku was more than happy to go off on his riding car; the trunk was filled with his dozens of vehicles piled high, and he was a busy boy. I took advantage of his entertaining himself to read and answer a couple of emails. </p>
<p>Riku and I had been playing with a balloon today and had such fun with it; he had learned how to hit it up, most times, and we had it going for quite a long time.  A couple of times he deliberately threw it into the sink and then would come and tell me, "Uh oh, balloon is in sink!" and I would go and rescue it. Soon we were off to the playground downstairs for one last visit. I had the front door open so that Riku could put on his sandals and step out while I got mine on. Less than a minute after leaving he stuck his head in the door and said that ol' familiar "Uh oh" once more. He told me that the balloon had gone over the railing; he was a bit upset about it. I picked him up telling him we would look for it, and there it was, floating slowly down floor after floor after floor. It was quite exciting to see and all the upset was replaced with wonder. We went searching for it but never did find that elusive bottom floor. Akane thinks it may be the sixth floor but we stopped looking after going down to B! and up to the 2nd. I wonder if he will mention it tomorrow? </p>
<p>Once again, the playground was empty when we arrived but within a half hour I bet there were about twenty children there, the most ever. Quite a few of them were older today... maybe seven and up a bit, and five of them had unicycles and were very good on them! I took photos of two seven year olds who were happy to be the center of attention; I said "Wow" when they went by the first time, and back they came again and again. Riku was of course thrilled to have so many children about; he flitted from one group to another, and a couple of times went off on his own into the little grove of trees to no doubt check on his stones and sticks stash. The older group of girls paid lots of attention to him, lifting him up and kneeling down to talk to him. I must say he does look very handsome with his new haircut! </p>
<p>I told the two women I know casually that we were leaving tomorrow, and the first one I met stopped to take photos of Riku and her son with her phone. I took some too, and then asked if I could have one of her with her son. Somehow she thought I meant the whole group of "regulars" so the other woman came back, bringing with her six or seven children as well. Lots of fun to have these familiar faces for Riku to see. I'm sure he will be seeing them all again in six months or so. </p>
<p>Riku was expecting that maybe his mom and his aunt would be there when we opened the door, but they weren't. Once he realized that he piped up with "Dinner!" Actually, he told me he wanted dessert first; I told him first dinner and then dessert and he looked at me, grinned, and said "dessert!" again. He knows he was teasing and quite enjoys it. I'm sure he misses the teasing he and his dad do together. </p>
<p>I had an egg with cheddar cheese melted in it on the table in less than five minutes, with tomatoes on the side and a half slice of toast. "This toast is delicious!" said Riku and "I like pepper!" referring to the freshly ground pepper on his egg. He also ate some of a little side dish of Akane's homemade sweet and sour veggie mix from two days ago, and then wanted custard for dessert! We had no custard and I told him he could have gelato or yogurt; he wasn't very impressed that he couldn't just have custard. Too bad as I passed a bakery with custards today and could have picked one up for him. However, he had a dish full of very sweet melon and a blueberry yogurt too and lots of water. "This is <strong>my</strong> water". </p>
<p>Akane and Ayako came in just as he was finishing up his dessert. He was delighted to have Auntie Ayako or Ayashan join him in play on the floor. They had such fun together while I made Ayako two grilled cheese (and tomato) sandwiches; she said she had been looking forward to it since having them two years ago when I was here. I had one too while Riku was eating his dinner. We had yet another turn at the "Franklin" book"; it will be going with us on the plane tomorrow for certain.</p>
<p>I had intended popping Riku right into the tub after his dinner, but Akane had emptied the tub and I wasn't sure how to fill it. There are all sorts of dials and switches that decide between half full and completely full, water temp', etc. so I was happy to have her home to get it started; it takes about twenty minutes for a half tub. </p>
<p>I did the dishes while that was going on and started to clear out the fridge and cupboards for tomorrow's departure. By that time I could get Riku into the sink for his quick washup before going into the tub for playing. He took a few moments to show Ayako how he could take off his own pants, his diaper (and put it in the garbage), and then go through his bathroom ritual. It will be interesting to hear what he does once he gets home, as I don't think he will be able to reach the light switch. He sat on the toilet and once again without fail did what he was supposed to do. I didn't even mention the toilet yesterday because he is almost always successful. A couple of times nothing happened; Riku says "Nothing in there" and wants off. </p>
<p>Ayako sat while he played in the tub and I continued on with the sorting. When it was time to take him out I rubbed him down in his towel and was carrying him into the tatami room for a rubdown and pjs. However, when we passed the bathroom he said "No, toilet!" and in he went, and succeeded again. This is the first time he has told me he had to go, as opposed to my asking him and him deciding yes or no. This afternoon he decided he would do the whole routine in the dark, with me in there with him. Very funny. We could hear him going but not see a thing except the tiny lit-up buttons on the toilet. </p>
<p>Akane wasn't feeling well, but she went off with Ayako to pick up a few grocery items for tomorrow and to eat some of her favourite noodles in the neighbourhood. I tucked Riku into bed; he prefers to have his mommy tuck him in but I told him about our day and he relaxed, commented a couple of times, and soon drifted off, later than I hoped, but asleep by 8:45. He was so dazed for the last hour that he looked like he wasn't focusing at times. </p>
<p>I will be at the park with Riku at 8:30 a.m., and Mrs. Goda has said she would be here to spend some time with Riku. I would love to dash to the gelato place to take the owner's photo but I may not be able to manage that. Mrs. Goda is also coming to the airport with us, which is great, as we really need some help with the car seat, an awkward box that Akane is taking along, and the rest of the luggage. </p>
<p>I'm off to bed at 11:30, an hour later than I planned... shall read myself to sleep in ten minutes, no doubt!</p>
<p>Goodnight and goodbye from Sakai City, Japan! It's been grand!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/friday_in_west_vancouver.html">Friday in West Vancouver</a></h2>
								<p>Ah, what a wonderful sleep I had, with the sound of flowing water from the creek running behind our bedroom at Judi and Con's. Judi and Con were both out of the house early so we took advantage and showered in their big wonderful shower "room"... no door, no curtains, no tub. </p>
<p>We left the house around 11:30 a.m. after polishing off a nice plateful of delicious organic strawberries. I stopped in at the local doctor's office to get a prescription renewed; had my blood pressure checked... excellent, and he suggested that I get some blood work done, including a fasting thyroid test. </p>
<p>We were both hungry and had a hard time trying to decide where to eat... "Sewell's" in Horseshoe Bay for some wild salmon? Dundarave for fish and chips? But they only gave me about seven big fries last time so that was out. "Milestones" at Park Royal? I know that Tom and Gail really like it, and Doug has never eaten there. Hmmm. </p>
<p>First though I wanted to take a photo of the little mailbox train that has been on lower Marine Drive since Kelly and Bryn were young. Did that and then decided that since the Dundarave bakery had closed that I had better get a photo of "Dundarave Fish and Chips" as that was such a favourite spot over the years; it was where I took Brooke for a special treat when it was just the two of us. </p>
<p>Alas, that too had disappeared and is now a boutique! Argggh! The old IGA is being renovated and when we lived here it was Stong's. We stopped in at "Capers" with their huge selection of ready-to-go foods and bought eight lovely small tarts for dessert tonight, three lemon curd, three chocolate orange and two mixed berry flans. </p>
<p>We wandered along the small block of stores and were astounded as to how many new places have gone in since we were here last. One of them was a bakery/cafe which sounded promising, "The Bakehouse Cafe". It was a great choice... they had samples of their most delicious very large cinnamon buns, so we had one of those, Doug had a bowl of vegetarian chili, and I had a small bowl of spinach/lentil soup and a half sandwich of Brie, avocado, tomatoes and cranberry chutney. It was as good as it sounded and served on very tasty crusty bread. I ate a third of the cinnamon bun too... yum! </p>
<p>Decided to head back to Judi's and leave some of our other errands until tomorrow. Judi, Taryn, Con, John, and Brooke were all here and after sitting for a few minutes we all went off to the club where the wedding is being held, taking all of the bridal party's dresses, suits, shoes, along with a sound system and other necessary items for the big day. Judi, Brooke, and I went in one car and stopped to pick up nine boxes of individual ice cream cakes in insulated bags. Traffic was terrible going over the bridge but we had the air-condioner on to keep the "cake" frozen. </p>
<p>Doug spent the afternoon cropping over five hundred photos of Japan for me! I did manage to delete over a hundred yesterday and a few more this morning. </p>
<p>Up to the suite which will be the dressing room for tomorrow and then the bridle suite for tomorrow night. Judi was expecting out of town guests for dinner and one couple had arrived by the time we got back to the house. Everyone pitched in with dinner.... barbecued chicken tended to by Colin, Judi did a huge pan of roasted potatoes, corn was prepared and cut up by Diane, I made the salad and the table was set outside with all the food laid out in the dining room. We had wine, lots of good company and laughs, and the food was so good. It was a gorgeous night and it was lovely to have both "the girls" there with us. The groom was out for the evening with an old friend from out of town.</p>
<p>We all cleared up the kitchen, Judi made tea and coffee, and we sat chatting outside until the mosquitos drove all but Doug and Colin inside. We chatted for a bit more, Brooke drove the one couple back to their hotel and the rest of us headed up to bed at 11:15. Taryn and Brooke are sleeping in the same bed tonight, as the rest of the house is booked... and it's hot out there! </p>
<p>Tomorrow is the big day!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/a_very_lazy_day.html">A Very Lazy Day</a></h2>
								<p>Well, I slept until 9:45 this morning... the last one in the house awake. Gail had been waiting to play cards for hours! Hung around in my dressing gown for a couple of hours too, while Tom and Doug showered, and until our late breakfast was finished. We all had eggs and toast, and of course Gail and I had tea while playing cards. </p>
<p>I finally showered and dressed, Gail and I sorted through the Hawaii photos, and I wrote a couple of emails. Gail offered to have the "gathering of friends" here on Sunday so I called Jody and Judi to let them know of the change. </p>
<p>Tom went off at 4 p.m. for his second-last day at work. We decided we were hungry and would have an early dinner. Gail grilled three vegie sausage-style hot dogs, which were delicious, served in rosemary flavoured rolls, with mustard and fresh tomatoes. and sides of potato and carrot salad for those who wanted them.  </p>
<p>Gail and I then walked over to visit Etta in her retirement home. It's just a twenty minute walk away, it was sunny and warm and a little walk was just what I needed. </p>
<p>The room is quite spacious, the home itself comfortable with lots of big chairs for reading in various tucked away spots, as well as in the main lounge area. Etta looks very well and gave us the grand tour. Gail said it was the most walking she has done in a long time; she is using a walked and seems very at ease pushing it ahead of her. </p>
<p>Gail had printed up my blogs for Etta to read, and she had enjoyed them; there was a computer in the games room so I got to show Etta lots of the photos from Japan, which she enjoyed. </p>
<p>After an hour and a bit Gail and I left to walk home, arriving back around 7 p.m. We were all a little peckish so around 8 p.m. Gail and I had a bowl of mixed fruit and yogurt, and Doug had some cheese and a hot cross bun. </p>
<p>The evening flew by; Gail and I played cards, I showered her some photos I had with me, I wrote a couple of emails, and we chatted away until bedtime at 10:30. I read for quite a while and turned out the light at 12:15.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/05/toms_last_day_at_work_ever.html">Tom's Last Day at Work... Ever!</a></h2>
								<p>Well, this is the big day for Tom; his very last afternoon shift. Hard to imagine. We all had a lazy morning at home; Gail and I had a big bowl of Red River cereal, played some cards, while Doug checked his email and got started at the big stack of magazines he brought with him to sort. Tom read the paper, talked to his mom, and showered, packing his last lunch complete with the banana which everyone knows is part of his routine. </p>
<p>Jody arrived at noon to pick me up for my visit with her at her new home in Qualicum Beach. We sat for a while here first, had a cup of herbal tea, and left about 1 p.m. in the drizzle. Stopped at Costco first, Jody signed on as a member, and I bought some shampoo and some camisoles for Kelly and for me. </p>
<p>It is about a forty minute trip to Qualicum, and we chatted away until we reached "Heritage Cottage", which was as lovely as I imagined it would be... original fir flooring, old family photos, antiques, cozy and inviting guest rooms, all light and airy and very homey. It was rainy and the den inviting, so we had some tea while watching Oprah, and then set off for the ten minute walk into town for dinner. </p>
<p>We ate at a new spot for Jody too, as it has just recently opened for dinner. We had a delicious light meal, sharing two quesadillas, with portobello mushrooms and spinach, and the other with fresh tomotoes and basil; a light rice salad and a green salad for each of us on the side was perfect. </p>
<p>Walked home after a stop at the grocery store for whipping cream, for our dessert. We looked at some of the photos from Japan, and all of the wedding pics, before settling down with tea and a most delicious homemade coconut cake in front of the tv to watch a current favourite show of Jody's, "House". It was a long lazy visit and very enjoyable.</p>
<p>We left at 10:15 for the trip back to Nanaimo; Gail was off with Tom at work, having gone with him at 4 p.m. for his last watch and the staff party that would take place over the evening. Doug had finished the last of his magazine sorting, and was looking forward to settling in to read a book. I haven't even begun to sort through my magazines... guess they will wait until Las Vegas. </p>
<p>Bed at midnight, up at 12:30... showered, bed at 1 a.m.</p>
