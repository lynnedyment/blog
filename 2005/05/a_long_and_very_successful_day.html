								<h2>A Long and Very Successful Day!</h2>
								<p>I awoke at 7:30 a.m. and tiptoed out of my room to work on my emails. All was quiet, but Riku was watching TV, and playing with his cars. He ate a little yogurt and later some toast and three more of the very expensive cherries. While changing his diaper I put him on the toilet and he was once again successful! I popped in the shower quickly, as Akane was leaving at 8:30 to walk to city hall, then on to her parents' place to meet Ayako, and from there to Akane's doctor appointment. Before she left, however, I once again asked Riku if he wanted to sit on the toilet; he said "OK", Akane put him on, and voila! I think he's got it! </p>
<p>After Akane left, Riku and I read some stories, played with his cars, and I prepared my breakfast... a hash brown potato square from the bakery downstairs, bought by Akane for me last night, and a perfect fried egg. Riku is gaining weight and I am losing it, and it's mostly because he has been eating half of my meals this trip! He ate so much of it that I cooked another egg and heated up the hash browns I had saved for tomorrow.</p>
<p>It was obvious that Riku was ready for a BM after he urinated again, and so I left his diaper off, hoping that would make it more obvious to him that he needed to sit on the toilet. He wasn't keen about this. At one point he asked, "Diaper back on!" and once it was he quietly went into a private spot on his own. Being a Nana with some experience I figured out what was happening and so quickly got that diaper off and Riku on the toilet. Nada! I don't think he is quite ready for this, so the diaper went on again. He held off all day until we got to his Bahbah's! Funny, no matter how many people there are around I seem to be the one who changes diapers; I even stayed in the tatami room so that his aunt or Bahbah could do it, but it was obvious that no one was too keen to get at it. I don't mind a bit; that is one cute little bottom! </p>
<p>I did up the dishes and we set off for the park as soon as I made up the snack containers. Our first object of the day was to see if by some stroke of good luck his sticks from yesterday were still where he left them, not too far from the door of the building; they were, and Riku was just delighted. On to the park I went with a happy little boy carrying his bundle of sticks. It was perfect timing, as there was a day care group there, with seven children accompanied by two women. One woman was having such fun with the children, running around the playground with them  following her, and scraping her heel in the sand making a track for them to follow. Riku joined in without hesitation. At one point the children spotted a butterfly; Riku was standing watching it flit about but the other children started shrieking and trying to chase it, which of course Riku started doing immediately. It was hilarious to see, actually, this group behaviour with him.</p>
<p>One little fellow went off to the furthest corner of the area, with shade, and a big pile of sand as well. Riku joined him and the teacher, sitting happily, chatting away. I went over when she wandered off to the other children, and took a couple of photos. This child obviously knows about digital cameras as each time I took one he came over to have a look, and wanted the camera too! </p>
<p>Sadly, the children left too soon for Riku's liking, so he walked around a bit before he tuckered out and I put him in the stroller. He snacked and slept for an hour and twenty minutes; it was perfect for walking... not too hot and not too cool, but just right. </p>
<p>Home for lunch as soon as he woke up, a little time at home playing, but then off to the little playground downstairs as it is too nice to be in and we hadn't been there for several days. I hadn't bothered taking the sand toys down as I was sure there would be other children there. I suggested to Riku that we go up and get them. He agreed but made sure we were coming back by saying "Not go home yet; get toys and go to playground. Not go home yet.", nodding his head in agreement with me. He was confident that I knew what he meant. Riku was quite happy playing with his sand toys on his own, but soon children arrived from school, wearing their navy and white uniforms and hats. </p>
<p>A few of the girls recognized us from quite a distance and waved enthusiastically, coming right over to say hello. There are twin girls, seven years old, who didn't go upstairs to change their clothes but went right into the sandbox to play with Riku. Of course he was delighted, and they stayed for the hour we were there. They like to try to chat with me and I sing to them. We did ABCD again and "head and shoulders" several times. One of them taught me how to play "paper, rock, scissors" by counting (I think to three) and then showing your hand. They were delighted that I knew how to play that game! </p>
<p>Since the one little girl kept singing ABC, I asked for paper and pencil and wrote out the upper case; we sang along with me pointing to the letters and we practiced saying "Z' which is difficult when your ttop teeth are missing! I told them in Canada we said "zed" and in America they say "zee". They repeated it both ways several times. Then I printed my name, and Riku's and they wrote theirs. By this time a third child joined us; she had gone up to change. They each told me how to spell their names in English although Akane thinks one of them has it wrong. The twins are Aya and Ui... Akane thinks it is Yui for sure, and the third girl is Junne, an unusual name says Akane. Then the twins drew pictures of their faces and had me do mine and Riku's! I did the lower case for them too and once again they broke into ABC with vigour! What enthusiasm! So very cute. I was hoping to keep the paper but it was obvious they wanted it so I took what I hope is a good photo of it. </p>
<p>... a little side story here I meant to write up the other night. The night that Akane, Riku, and I headed over to the park across the street in the evening, so that Akane got out for a bit, we met up with the twins and two younger siblings. The twins, I learned yesterday, are seven, and my guess is that the siblings were five and three. They were alone and about to cross a fairly busy road; it was about 7:30 or 8 p.m. I asked Akane to ask where their parents were as they seemed to be alone. They were; their parents were both at work! Akane told me this is not uncommon here. The children have a key, I suppose their dinners are left out for them, and she said they are very responsible. But of course I wondered what would happen if one of the little ones disappeared, and how they would manage to get help if they ran into trouble. There was an older brother somewhere too, but he wasn't with them, and they didn't seem concerned at all. </p>
<p>Riku and I left our friends at 3 p.m. The grand plan for the afternoon was for Riku to have a later afternoon nap than usual, as we are due at the Goda's at 7 p.m. for a special ceremony. Akane's niece is three months old, and there is a tradition that they get a taste of solid food, which in this case is an octopus. They call it "kissing an octopus". There was to be a big catered dinner of bento boxes brought in, and Akane's mother had worked hard to get everything in order for this evening. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it turned out, we had told Riku he was going to his Bahbah's house later. Big mistake! I think it was on his mind from the time he got into that stroller. He would be drifting off and then sit up and say "Go to Bahbah's house!" I would say "Yes, later we are going to Bahbah's house." Fifteen minutes later, when I was sure he was asleep I would take a peek and he would open those sleepy eyes and say "Play with Auntie Ayako"... and so it went... "See baby", and "Play house". My back was giving out on me, trying to walk quickly to help the sandman along but nothing worked. I walked until almost 5:15 p.m., and finally decided I would try my luck at home, in an air-conditioned room. </p>
<p>Thank goodness Akane walked in just as I had put him on the toilet for the seventh successful time this day!!!... once in the public toilet downstairs! I thought a little nursing time with his mom would do the trick, and sat down to write a couple of emails. A half hour later guess who was out, beaming away, with a frustrated mommy? I knew there was going to be trouble in River City if he didn't get some sleep. I envisioned precious things flying at his Buhbuh's house and a shrieking boy running around madly, while the baby howled! So, off I went with him for another try. It almost worked about five times... drifting off in my arns, head down, and then up would come that head and he would be grinning away. Once he was face down, breathing heavily, and then rolled over, and said "Go to Buhbuh's house now?" Oy vay! </p>
<p>It was too late to do a thing about this by now. I lay him on the kitchen counter, washed his hair, popped him in a warm tub, to at least relax him a bit, and dressed him, while Akane was downstairs doing last-minute shopping before our grocery store downstairs closes for three days. Ayako was downstairs waiting for us, and drove us at last to Bahbah's house! Gigi was there too, and Auntie Ayako, Akane's brother, his wife, and their sweet sweet baby, who made barely a peep all night. She sleeps through the night! and has for ages (Riku too is sleeping through the night and has for about ten days!). I have oodles of photos of her and of everyone else too. </p>
<p>Before sitting down to our very elaborate dinner, Gigi held the baby, who was beautifully dressed in a long pink brocade gown, every bit of her covered up except her darling face. Mrs. Goda handed him a piece of octopus with chop sticks, he took them and put it to the baby's mouth. She grimaced and turned away! Everyone laughed; turns out that no one ate the octopus on their plates. Riku looked at it at one point and asked me "What is this?" I told him it was octopus and he said "Riku not like octopus". Well, neither do his mom or uncle or auntie, so that is fine. I don't think the Goda's Sr. ate any either. Both children had very large settings of food ordered for them as well. They had a whole fish each, complete with head and teeth and tail. Riku didn't touch his; I think it was going to be eaten at the Goda's for lunch today. He did eat battered shrimp, though, and went around trying to entice everyone else out of theirs! The second one he ate he was crunching away at the tail; I told him not to eat the tail (he hadn't with the first one) but Akane said that was fine, that many people do. And I got to change that diaper today! Akane said she was going to throw up! </p>
<p>Back to the party... Mrs. Goda had ordered an all-vegetarian bento box for me and it was all delicious: lots of little dishes filled with assorted shapes and colours of vegetables and tofu, lots of tasty and new to me flavours, and a lovely fruit plate, just small, with fresh pineapple and an orange section. Everyone had these and Riku went around asking for strawberries. I'm glad strawberry season will not be over when we get home. And we must make sure to get him some Olson's cherries in July! </p>
<p>Lots of chatting over dinner, eyes on Riku, who was in such a happy mood, flitting about and not paying a lot of attention to the baby, but some... giving her a rattle several times, touching her cheek twice, but mostly entertaining the crowd. He is a party man; it would have been awfully quiet there without him! </p>
<p>After dinner, Akane, Ayako, and their brother went upstairs to the computer... maybe something to do with their digital cameras... Riku was with them and Mrs. Goda invited me to sit in her massage chair. It's a wonder I am not still there! However, Riku came down the stairs on his own too quickly during that time and fell (he is limping a bit today, told Akane this morning his foot hurt), and so we, along with the baby and her parents, made our exits. It was late enough; home at 10:30 and straight into bed for Riku, after brushing of teeth, and successful toilet trip number eight!! What a guy! </p>
<p>I did sit down to write this blog but was honestly just too tired. I couldn't think of a way to make it shorter as there was so much to share.</p>
