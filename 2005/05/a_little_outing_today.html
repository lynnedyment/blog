								<h2>A Little Outing Today</h2>
								<p>Ah, today I woke up at 4 a.m., an hour later than yesterday! Thanks to my little flashlight I read for fifteen minutes and went back to sleep. Riku and Akane were awake at 6 a.m.; I heard Riku playing happily, running around, so stayed tucked into bed reading for forty-five minutes. Riku was eating his yogurt, cnnamon toast, and orange juice, so I joined him at the table and read the two Franklin books to him.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Riku got busy in his kitchen, making his Nana tea and a bowl of porridge, stirring it vigourously after adding all four of his seasonings.... curry, salt, pepper, and paprika! </p>
<p>Akane was busy moving the computer from her bedroom into the tatami room, so we could use it while Riku naps. As soon as that was done, I checked my emails for the first time and spent quite a few minutes deleting too many junk mails! I watched a bit of Riku's favourite children's TV show with him; the most adorable small children were dressed up in costumes, whirling and swirling about to the music. </p>
<p>Off to shower and then we all sat at the table for breakfast. Akane had her BLC, Riku asked for "ebi"... shrimp, but only ate a few of the noodles in the dish. He was a tired boy... no kidding! after that late to bed night, so I tucked a reluctant little fellow into bed for a morning nap. He was asleep in less than seven minutes ("hold me, hold me") and woke at that forty minute point, not willing to go back to sleep and scratching at his neck. It almost looked as though he had an allergic reaction to somethiing so I cooled him off in the sink, and put some lotion on him.</p>
<p>While Riku ate some hot cereal, Akane was instant messaging with Bryn, and then he called and we spoke for a few minutes. And then it was a dash for the 12:02 train to Akane's doctor appointment. We made it and did a transfer to the area where the clinic is located. Riku enjoyed playing in the small toy room, mostly building very tall towers and playing "house" with the dishes and pots and pans. Nice, an engineer who likes to cook!</p>
<p>Akane saw the doctor; we have a new due date... December the 15th, not looking good for Bryn's wish for a late November birth! Akane had a second ultrasound done; the fetus looks much bigger than last week, but the angle is quite different too.</p>
<p>Akane was hungry and I remembered a nice little bakery where, two and a half years ago, Bryn and I used to buy an occasional egg sandwich; I remembered how good they were and after walking up the wrong road first, I mananged to find the right place. Akane bought Riku a round white roll and an egg custard, which he ate with gusto; she chose two tasty sandwiches for herself, sharing the egg half of an egg and ham sandwich with me. Yum!</p>
<p>We caught the train to the next station past ours, Sakainigashi, to try to find some new sandals for Riku; the ones I brought from home are too narrow for him. There is a smaller branch of the wonderful department store Takashimi, which I liked so very much on my last visit. Riku was as happy as could be in the toy department, mostly playing with a steering wheel with key, engine sounds, a horn, gear shifts, blinkers, etc, while Akane found a pair of casual and waterproof sandals for him. They look so big on his feet but he is a growing boy! </p>
<p>Before heading home we stopped down on the food floor, a wondrous place, and picked up some yogurt for Riku, bananas for me, and sushi for Akane for dinner. We walked home, about a forty minute walk, with Riku napping immediately. One the way back, just a couple of blocks from home, we spotted a very small stall selling fresh produce; Akane hadn't noticed it before and bought some sweet oranges. The prices were very good, so we will go back there again if the oranges really are sweet. Akane went right up to the apartment with the groceries while I continued on a long walk with Riku; he napped from 3:30 until 4:30, and we stopped for an hour's playtime in the little playground downstairs. There were two very friendly moms there with their children and Riku was a happy boy. </p>
<p>He was still fussy at home with not quite enough sleep under his belt, but ate a good sized dinner of scrambled egg, boiled carrot circles, 3/4 piece of whole wheat toast, a little squash, some cherry tomatoes (which he loves), strawberries, apple slices, and a cookie! While I gave Riku another sink bath to cool him off again, Akane went down for milk, eating her dinner when she returned. Riku sat right down and wanted some of her rice and ate quite a few bites of each of her crab dishes, plus two more tiny cookies. His daddy would have been amazed to see all that he tucked into! We certainly were. I just had to weigh him after this and sans diaper he was 12.5 kilos... 27 pounds, I believe. </p>
<p>After all this fuel, Riku played on his own, howling around the house, running at top speed, shouting!, laughing out loud, making <strong>us</strong> laugh out loud at his antics. What a character he is! Finally slowing down, he was ready for some drawing time and a story, and then tuck-in at 8:45. He wasn't asleep until 9:20, but was a happy boy... chattering away about his day I suppose.</p>
<p>Akane and I were tired as well, so she went off at 10:25 p.m. and I wrote one or two short emails, heading to bed at 10:45, tired and well exercised!</p>
