								<h2>A Very Long Day</h2>
								<p>... started at 5:15 a.m. today! Not sure what woke Riku up but he burst into my room at this ungodly hour and I am on my way to bed for 10 p.m. tonight. At 6:15 it was obvious he really needed to nap; he had his usual breakfast, played a bit and then I took him into my room to lie down. He wasn't happy about it, but was sound asleep in just ten minutes, tucked into my bed with the air conditioner going, just to block out street noise. </p>
<p>I went in to shower, fulling intending to be on the listen for his sensitive forty-minute disturbance time, but missed it by ten minutes. However, Akane said, after she emerged from her room a half hour later, that he had come out of my room, said he wanted to go to bed, and off they went! He only slept an hour and a half, but it was long enough to get him through the rest of the morning and lunchtime. During his nap, I managed to get that last unwritten blog done too, so that will make my nights less long. </p>
<p>No drawing at the table for him during the day today... unusual, but we did read stories, and he kept busy with his cars and buses and trains instead. Snack time after his nap: blueberries, a banana half, and a half slice of raisin toast. We're almost out of the whole wheat raisin bread, which is too bad as it is not available here. </p>
<p>Riku and I went off to the park at 11 a.m. (after sitting on the toilet for a few minutes first), and were out until 12:30. It was a lovely day, bright and sunny, although with a bit of a wind in the morning. He ran up the hills, collected a brand new crop of rocks, but today there were a few children in the park and he had such a good time with them. One of the children had stickers that he shared, so there were four children with stickers on their arms and cheeks and, in Riku's case, his neck too. He and a little girl played among the few trees, collecting sticks and stones and putting them in a pile. Riku found a circular disc somewhat above ground and decided to try to balance on one foot, which he did! ... and with his foot quite high in the air. Two little girls and a boy were hanging on to a rod and lifting their legs off the ground, and even though I didn't manage to get a photo of him doing this, he was successful at it too, much to my surprise. Once the other children left it was easy to convince Riku it was time to go home for lunch. </p>
<p>Akane had almost finished preparing him whole wheat pasta, fresh tomatoes with some tomato sauce, finely chopped carrots, spinach, and mushrooms. He was really hungry when he walked in, despite his good morning snack; this boy is packing in the food and gaining weight! I washed a few cherry tomatoes for him, and by the time he was asking for more his lunch was ready. He now blows on his food in little puffs and then eats it even when it is still quite hot. He ate all but one bite of a good-sized bowl of it, then had some strawberries, and white raisin roll from the bakery yesterday. </p>
<p>At 1:30 he was sound asleep with his mom. She came out about forty five minutes later, and Riku slept over two and a half hours! He was still white and listless when he came out of the room, and snuggled up on my lap while we discussed going to the playground and what his snack would be. I made up a little plate of two tiny filled Japanese children's cookies, a few sliced strawberries, two big grapes in sections, and four small sticks of gouda cheese. </p>
<p>We were at the playground downstairs at 4:45, the latest ever, and the two "regular" moms were there, plus a few other older children on their own. Riku was a little quieter today (that short night took its toll), but he had a good time, rode a little push car around for a bit, collected small sticks with some of the older girls helping him, and finally got his hands on the bat and ball, much to his delight. A dad came out to play catch with his son, and Riku went over with the ball, handed it to the dad, who threw it to Riku. He had the bat extended and it looked for a moment as though he really knew what he was doing! </p>
<p>A funny thing happened with me while there. The first woman I ever met there has a daughter about six years old, and a son just two years old. I was sitting on the bench watching the children, and the little guy came over to me, extended his hands and put them on either side of my face, grinning at me. It made the other moms there, and his too, laugh, but he must have done it about twenty times! I started doing it to him too but he just wanted to touch my face and squeeze it a little. His mom finally came over and distracted him but it took a few tries. Have no idea what was going on there but it was amusing. </p>
<p>I know the older children are quite intrigued by me; they often come over and try to talk to me, or stand a little bit away just staring until another child chats me up, and then they too come closer. They are very sweet and repeat words that I say to Riku... 'ball', or "come back", or "careful" and do so very well. Tonight, two girls about six years old, possibly twins, came over to show us a small plastic box with flowers and a butterfly in it, while the second child gave Riku a good sized chunk of white bun with raisins, which he was happy to accept. </p>
<p>I had asked Akane to bathe and join us in the playground, as she hadn't been out today, and at 5:45 she did so, wearing her new white skirt. We went to the bakery and bought a few goodies: a rectangle of hash brown potato for me, some nice black sesame, maybe oats, and whole grain bread as well, and Akane picked up a few of her and Riku's favourites too. Akane asked, on my behalf, if the baker (a young fellow who was there when I visited two and a half years ago) would do a whole wheat loaf. She wasn't sure if it is going to be all whole wheat, but he said it would be ready after 10 a.m. tomorrow. </p>
<p>Akane had a hankering for a Mos (a local burger chain) shrimp burger so we walked across the bridge near the train station for her take out order. Poor Riku was not happy to learn we weren't going on a train. He burst into tears when he found out we were going home; he was also ready to cry when he thought we were heading right home after the playground (Oh! To bakery? Not home. Okay!). This is a sure sign that he is a very tired fellow. </p>
<p>He and I came right up to the apartment so he could have dinner asap. Tonight was the second time he has said "I'm hungry", and I'm so glad he is now able to say this. I told Akane tonight at the table that he used to say "yogurt" with a whine in his voice when he was hungry before, and although he still says that, he can also be more clear about his needs. </p>
<p>And a hungry boy he was! I quickly made him a very spinach-y omelette with cheese. I was sure he was going to balk at the bright green bits sticking out all over, but he ate all but one bite on his own, using his fork so well. I also made a small bowl of four-grain hot cereal for him; he ate all of the berries and all but a few spoonfuls of the cereal, then asked for a banana. That is quite a round tummy on this boy right now!</p>
<p>I popped him into the sink for a quick wash, and then into the soaking tub for some relaxing water playtime. I noticed tonight that the water comes up to only his belly button, not to his arm pits. The water was cooler tonight and I asked him if it was too cold or if it was alright. He thought about it while dangling his feet in the water and then said seriously, "It's alright". I do this a lot with him now... "Would you like something else to eat or are you alright?" or "Okay". He always lets me know after thinking about it for a few seconds... "I'm okay" or "I hungry". "Would you like more dinner or are you ready for dessert?" Hmm, he's "ready for dessert" almost always.</p>
<p>I told him he could draw a little bit after his tub, so he did that but said when he sat down, "I'm hungry"! I asked if he wanted cereal or toast and he decided on toast, so a half slice of toasted whole wheat toast with butter was consumed during his drawing session. Tonight I had to draw his daddy, his mommy, his friend Alex, and his Grandpa.</p>
<p>On the way into the building tonight this tired little boy said, "Where's Daddy?" I hope it's not too long before they are together again. I know he must miss him. He often rolls his eyes around at me, pretending not to notice me, and then says, "Daddy do that to Riku". His daddy is going to see huge changes in him! </p>
<p>At 10 p.m., after being in the bedroom for almost an hour, Riku was out here with a dirty diaper. Akane said he was almost asleep but with all that food in him today, I'm not surprised that he needed some relief! I hope that Akane is tucked in for the night, as I am heading off to bed myself. Five and a half hours sleep is absolutely not enough for me! </p>
<p>p.s. I am trying in many different ways to make Riku more independent. He is becoming more and more comfortable at sitting on the toilet, and for a longer period of time. One day soon we hope for more than just a chat session but for now we are very pleased that he is willing to sit there. He is struggling to take off most of his clothes now, although tiny buttons are far beyond him just yet. However, he now takes off his own pants, gets most of his shirts off, takes down his own diaper and throws the wet ones in the garbage, knows how to do up the velcro straps on his sandals and figured out, with just a little help from his Nana, that he can use the edge of a ledge to pull against to take them off. Yesterday I taught him which two pieces of his shoelaces to pull to undo them... and how to loosen them up to take them off... he's working hard on these things, and doesn't want anyone else to do them for him. What a guy! </p>
<p>Good night... I'm washed out and ready to tuck in at 10:20... I'll be asleep at 10:30, no doubt!</p>
