								<h2>Last Day in Japan ... for this trip</h2>
								<p>Riku woke at 6:15 this morning, a little too early for last night's late-to-bed time, but he was happy to be up and about, as was I. I popped into the shower early as I wanted to get Riku out to the park asap. And how happy I am that I did; we had such a wonderful time there. But, I digress... first came a huge bowl of Riku's breakfast request for porridge. I have been adding a finely chopped apricot, some cranberries, and just this past few days some very finely minced almonds, for extra protein for him. He just wolfs it down although this morning ate toast with it too, so we saved the rest of the porridge for his mid-morning snack. He wanted his mom to clean his kitchen today! ... asked her while I was sitting at the table with her, but they ended up doing it together. Much better training! </p>
<p>Back to the park; we arrived at 9:10 today. It was cool and quite windy so it was pretty empty. Riku was disappointed not to see some childen there. I told him maybe they were napping and he said "No children napping", quite sternly. Eventually a little boy showed up and they tossed and kicked a ball around for a bit. By 10 a.m. he was quite ready to go in his stroller for a snack, having checked out both his stone and stick stashes, and taken a couple of trips down the slide. He has been working hard at putting just one foot on each step going up, but the steps are steep and it's a bit of a stretch for him. He is persevering though... </p>
<p>Riku had his snack in hand in the stroller when I spotted the little girl he had played with yesterday. My camera wasn't working then, and I was so sorry I hadn't a photo of them together as they seem so compatible. They both collect stones for instance... very important. </p>
<p>The mom seemed happy to see us too and the two children instantly raced over to the fountain, continuing where they left off yesterday. Lots of photos today, and her mom, Kei, and I got to know each other a bit. She speaks a little English and told me her husband speaks it very well. </p>
<p>I told her we were leaving tomorrow and she said she was very sad, as she too thinks the children play so well together. They certainly do; it's just so adorable to see them together. She took some photos and said she was sorry she hadn't known we would be there as she would have liked some video of them together. It was hard to get photos of them, as her daughter Tomoha is a mover! </p>
<p>While the children were playing, the man with the two dogs whom Riku and I see each time we are in the park was busy taking lots of photos of them but mostly of Riku, and of Riku interacting with two smaller dogs he had with him today. He showed me one very good shot and I asked him if he had email. Unfortunately not. Ah well, I thought, at least he has good taste! </p>
<p>So, the children ran up a hill and collected more stones, and down some steep but wide steps on their own, where they found a treasure lode of even more stones! Riku went off on his own for a bit to visit with the woman who is also there each morning with her dog. They had quite a long visit; Riku inspected her small dog's nails, got thoroughly licked and enjoyed it, identified the dog as being a male dog!, and spoke both Japanese and English to the owner who speaks English quite well. Riku was kissing the dog on his head and patting away; this is the most attention I have seen him give one dog, and I think it was because he was so very gentle... no jumping or nipping. </p>
<p>Kei and I exchanged email addresses and regular addresses as well; we will keep in touch for certain and the next time I am back here with Riku we can give her a call and get the children together. Kei is 37 years old and Tomoha will be three on December the 16th. She suggested we find someone to take our photos together with the children, which we did. </p>
<p>A bit later the kind man with the dogs and the camera came up to me and gave me a print of Riku! It is just gorgeous, a large and beautiful photo of Riku's face peeking out from under his hat. I was so touched and so thankful. He bowed and said "you're welcome" and left. Not too long after that I tried to find him, thinking that I should have had his photo for Riku but he had gone. </p>
<p>Before Kei left, though, she was chatting with him (Riku was busy with the woman and I hadn't noticed him coming back) and said he had asked her to find out if I could possibly be at the park in the morning; they all knew by then that we are leaving for SF in the afternoon. I said I could be there with Riku at 8:30 and he bowed once again, thanked me and left. Kei said he has another photo he would like to give to me. How wonderful is this? Kei gave my hand a squeeze when she said goodbye and hoped that we would meet again in December. </p>
<p>Riku was reluctant to leave at 11:30 when they did, but he was obviously worn out from all his running and collecting... into the stroller he went with his tiny fruit container first... some orange segments and six apple slices, followed by his toast and one cookie snack. Just as we were leaving the large courtyard area, a group of maybe thirty pre-school children went by us in a line. One of the little girls recognized us from the playground downstairs and called out a big "<strong>Hi!</strong>" to us. I gave a big wave and "<strong>Hi!</strong>" back to her and soon we had all thirty children waving and calling out "hello"s and "hi"s to us; it was just too cute for words and the teachers were beaming away. I bowed to them and they all bowed back to me. Riku was delighted, as was I. It felt like a real goodbye from Japan. </p>
<p>Riku was asleep in less than five minutes after that, toast container slipping out of his hand. He slept for two solid hours! while I walked up and down the same shady street, quite a long one, thank goodness. Too bad the gelato place was closed! </p>
<p>I was so hungry by this time... four plus hours of solid walking and I was happy when Riku awoke and I could head home. We walked in the door and Riku said "Lunch!" Yes, sir. We had talked about what he would have on the way home, and had decided on eggs and "bacon" and tomatoes and toast. However, sitting on the table was a small but generous bowl of a mixed rice and vegetable dish Akane had made for us, and a big one for me. We both ate every bite of it; it was delicious. Riku had some cherry tomatoes after that, and then more toast. He is an eating machine these days! For dessert (which he tried to talk me into before his lunch), he had his leftover gelato and some of the very tasty apple gelato, my gift from last night. It was very good but not as creamy (read, not high fat) as the coconut or custard.</p>
<p>Arggh! I just deleted the rest of this blog! I was completely finished, went to add one more comment, and somehow managed to wipe it all out, despite having done not only a "save" but a "copy" as well! I am tired, it's almost 11 p.m., and I should be in bed reading, but I cannot leave this to finish in three weeks when I am home again! </p>
<p>Akane had found the "Franklin" book that she left here last trip; we discovered it on Riku's table and he was so happy to see it. We read it over lunch and then again after lunch. By then Riku was more than happy to go off on his riding car; the trunk was filled with his dozens of vehicles piled high, and he was a busy boy. I took advantage of his entertaining himself to read and answer a couple of emails. </p>
<p>Riku and I had been playing with a balloon today and had such fun with it; he had learned how to hit it up, most times, and we had it going for quite a long time.  A couple of times he deliberately threw it into the sink and then would come and tell me, "Uh oh, balloon is in sink!" and I would go and rescue it. Soon we were off to the playground downstairs for one last visit. I had the front door open so that Riku could put on his sandals and step out while I got mine on. Less than a minute after leaving he stuck his head in the door and said that ol' familiar "Uh oh" once more. He told me that the balloon had gone over the railing; he was a bit upset about it. I picked him up telling him we would look for it, and there it was, floating slowly down floor after floor after floor. It was quite exciting to see and all the upset was replaced with wonder. We went searching for it but never did find that elusive bottom floor. Akane thinks it may be the sixth floor but we stopped looking after going down to B! and up to the 2nd. I wonder if he will mention it tomorrow? </p>
<p>Once again, the playground was empty when we arrived but within a half hour I bet there were about twenty children there, the most ever. Quite a few of them were older today... maybe seven and up a bit, and five of them had unicycles and were very good on them! I took photos of two seven year olds who were happy to be the center of attention; I said "Wow" when they went by the first time, and back they came again and again. Riku was of course thrilled to have so many children about; he flitted from one group to another, and a couple of times went off on his own into the little grove of trees to no doubt check on his stones and sticks stash. The older group of girls paid lots of attention to him, lifting him up and kneeling down to talk to him. I must say he does look very handsome with his new haircut! </p>
<p>I told the two women I know casually that we were leaving tomorrow, and the first one I met stopped to take photos of Riku and her son with her phone. I took some too, and then asked if I could have one of her with her son. Somehow she thought I meant the whole group of "regulars" so the other woman came back, bringing with her six or seven children as well. Lots of fun to have these familiar faces for Riku to see. I'm sure he will be seeing them all again in six months or so. </p>
<p>Riku was expecting that maybe his mom and his aunt would be there when we opened the door, but they weren't. Once he realized that he piped up with "Dinner!" Actually, he told me he wanted dessert first; I told him first dinner and then dessert and he looked at me, grinned, and said "dessert!" again. He knows he was teasing and quite enjoys it. I'm sure he misses the teasing he and his dad do together. </p>
<p>I had an egg with cheddar cheese melted in it on the table in less than five minutes, with tomatoes on the side and a half slice of toast. "This toast is delicious!" said Riku and "I like pepper!" referring to the freshly ground pepper on his egg. He also ate some of a little side dish of Akane's homemade sweet and sour veggie mix from two days ago, and then wanted custard for dessert! We had no custard and I told him he could have gelato or yogurt; he wasn't very impressed that he couldn't just have custard. Too bad as I passed a bakery with custards today and could have picked one up for him. However, he had a dish full of very sweet melon and a blueberry yogurt too and lots of water. "This is <strong>my</strong> water". </p>
<p>Akane and Ayako came in just as he was finishing up his dessert. He was delighted to have Auntie Ayako or Ayashan join him in play on the floor. They had such fun together while I made Ayako two grilled cheese (and tomato) sandwiches; she said she had been looking forward to it since having them two years ago when I was here. I had one too while Riku was eating his dinner. We had yet another turn at the "Franklin" book"; it will be going with us on the plane tomorrow for certain.</p>
<p>I had intended popping Riku right into the tub after his dinner, but Akane had emptied the tub and I wasn't sure how to fill it. There are all sorts of dials and switches that decide between half full and completely full, water temp', etc. so I was happy to have her home to get it started; it takes about twenty minutes for a half tub. </p>
<p>I did the dishes while that was going on and started to clear out the fridge and cupboards for tomorrow's departure. By that time I could get Riku into the sink for his quick washup before going into the tub for playing. He took a few moments to show Ayako how he could take off his own pants, his diaper (and put it in the garbage), and then go through his bathroom ritual. It will be interesting to hear what he does once he gets home, as I don't think he will be able to reach the light switch. He sat on the toilet and once again without fail did what he was supposed to do. I didn't even mention the toilet yesterday because he is almost always successful. A couple of times nothing happened; Riku says "Nothing in there" and wants off. </p>
<p>Ayako sat while he played in the tub and I continued on with the sorting. When it was time to take him out I rubbed him down in his towel and was carrying him into the tatami room for a rubdown and pjs. However, when we passed the bathroom he said "No, toilet!" and in he went, and succeeded again. This is the first time he has told me he had to go, as opposed to my asking him and him deciding yes or no. This afternoon he decided he would do the whole routine in the dark, with me in there with him. Very funny. We could hear him going but not see a thing except the tiny lit-up buttons on the toilet. </p>
<p>Akane wasn't feeling well, but she went off with Ayako to pick up a few grocery items for tomorrow and to eat some of her favourite noodles in the neighbourhood. I tucked Riku into bed; he prefers to have his mommy tuck him in but I told him about our day and he relaxed, commented a couple of times, and soon drifted off, later than I hoped, but asleep by 8:45. He was so dazed for the last hour that he looked like he wasn't focusing at times. </p>
<p>I will be at the park with Riku at 8:30 a.m., and Mrs. Goda has said she would be here to spend some time with Riku. I would love to dash to the gelato place to take the owner's photo but I may not be able to manage that. Mrs. Goda is also coming to the airport with us, which is great, as we really need some help with the car seat, an awkward box that Akane is taking along, and the rest of the luggage. </p>
<p>I'm off to bed at 11:30, an hour later than I planned... shall read myself to sleep in ten minutes, no doubt!</p>
<p>Goodnight and goodbye from Sakai City, Japan! It's been grand!</p>
