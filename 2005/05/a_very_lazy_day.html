								<h2>A Very Lazy Day</h2>
								<p>Well, I slept until 9:45 this morning... the last one in the house awake. Gail had been waiting to play cards for hours! Hung around in my dressing gown for a couple of hours too, while Tom and Doug showered, and until our late breakfast was finished. We all had eggs and toast, and of course Gail and I had tea while playing cards. </p>
<p>I finally showered and dressed, Gail and I sorted through the Hawaii photos, and I wrote a couple of emails. Gail offered to have the "gathering of friends" here on Sunday so I called Jody and Judi to let them know of the change. </p>
<p>Tom went off at 4 p.m. for his second-last day at work. We decided we were hungry and would have an early dinner. Gail grilled three vegie sausage-style hot dogs, which were delicious, served in rosemary flavoured rolls, with mustard and fresh tomatoes. and sides of potato and carrot salad for those who wanted them.  </p>
<p>Gail and I then walked over to visit Etta in her retirement home. It's just a twenty minute walk away, it was sunny and warm and a little walk was just what I needed. </p>
<p>The room is quite spacious, the home itself comfortable with lots of big chairs for reading in various tucked away spots, as well as in the main lounge area. Etta looks very well and gave us the grand tour. Gail said it was the most walking she has done in a long time; she is using a walked and seems very at ease pushing it ahead of her. </p>
<p>Gail had printed up my blogs for Etta to read, and she had enjoyed them; there was a computer in the games room so I got to show Etta lots of the photos from Japan, which she enjoyed. </p>
<p>After an hour and a bit Gail and I left to walk home, arriving back around 7 p.m. We were all a little peckish so around 8 p.m. Gail and I had a bowl of mixed fruit and yogurt, and Doug had some cheese and a hot cross bun. </p>
<p>The evening flew by; Gail and I played cards, I showered her some photos I had with me, I wrote a couple of emails, and we chatted away until bedtime at 10:30. I read for quite a while and turned out the light at 12:15.</p>
