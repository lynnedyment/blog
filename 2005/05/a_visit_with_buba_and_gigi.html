								<h2>A Visit with Buba and Gigi</h2>
								<p>Happy birthday Gram! I thought of her as soon as I woke up this morning, which was at 5:30 when I heard Riku. However, I went back to sleep for another hour; Gram didn't sleep late, so it is only fitting that I am awake at the crack of dawn on her day. </p>
<p>Later, Akane told me that Riku had had a bad dream; he called out asking for cookies! Life is tough when you're just two. At 6:30 Riku opened my door, greeting me with that big "good morning" grin of his. I sent him out for a diaper; his drawers were definitely drooping! Akane had gone back to bed so after a diaper change up we got for breakfast, with his... yes!... yogurt and berries and orange juice. Just a half a slice of toast today; guess his tummy is full from all that pasta yesterday! </p>
<p>We have been invited to the Goda's today at 11:30, to have a look at the new house and for lunch out at a noodle restaurant. We are going to walk there, about an hour's walk, and knowing Riku might need just a little more nap time than that came up with this plan. Riku and I left the house at 9 a.m. for some time in the playground on the 2nd floor (outside), leaving Akane alone to have her bath. This worked well; Riku was delighted to be there, even with no other children today, and we built a big "mountain", placing tiny sticks and leaves in the top of it. Before leaving forty-five minutes later, Riku asked me to make a C, W, S, T, and B in the sand, so we left it all there for the next lot of children. </p>
<p>We stopped in the apartment just long enough to change Riku's clothes, and then headed off for a walk around the big blocks surrounding these two huge complexes. Riku fell asleep almost immediately, thank goodness, and we met Akane as planned at 10:30 at the door. It was only a forty minute walk and Riku awoke just as we approached the corner of their street. He knew where we were going and was happy to have arrived. </p>
<p>I had seen the house two and a half years ago when it was first built, but it was not furnished or landscaped. Now there are flowers and greenery in the front yard, and the tatami room, where we sat, is painted a lovely soft sage green. I remembered the beautiful expanse of light coloured wooden floors and the large American-style kitchen, although was only in the tatami room and the upstairs bathroom this visit. I really would have liked to have taken photos but was not sure that it would be polite to ask; later I checked with Akane and she said she is sure her mom would have been just fine with that. Perhaps I will get over there again. </p>
<p>Mrs. Goda, Riku, and I sat in the tatami room, at the long and wide wooden table, seated on very comfortable low wooden chairs with padding and backs. It was perfect for me as one can stretch out and yet still be close to the table. We admired Mrs. Goda's soft watercolours of the fish she has painted; she is taking painting classes and the fish were lovely. </p>
<p>Akane was upstairs with her sister Ayako, who now lives there, and Mrs. Goda served Riku and me delicious cold drinks made from vegetables and fruit, and put out a plate of soft and tender cookies to nibble on. Riku was very content sitting there until he had eaten his cookie, and then went dashing off to find his Auntie Ayako. </p>
<p>She, Akane, and Riku all joined us there a few minutes later. It was so nice to see Ayako again, with her big smile. She managed to tell me that my face was much slimmer and that I had lost weight since the last time; this is true and it was nice that she thought to tell me so. I worked out later that I have actually lost about 6 kilos since then. </p>
<p>Ayako came downstairs carrying her old doll house, complete with furniture. It is a simple wooden structure open on one full side, and Riku was intrigued. He put out the tiny table and two chairs, checked out the bed and the dressers, but mostly liked the three-inch teddy bear mommy and daddy, spending most of his time propping them up and talking to them. The most wonderful thing about it to my eyes were several of Mrs. Goda's pieces of furniture from when she was a child... beautifully made, tiny sofa and chairs with backs that lean back, a vanity with three sided mirrors, although the middle one was missing. Akane said it was there when she played with it many years ago, so Ayako must have damaged it! </p>
<p>Mr. Goda arrived home from his shop around the corner and after admiring a newly-discovered pair of photos of him when he was a much younger man, we set off for lunch, a "Denny's" just a few blocks away. I'm not sure what happened to the noodle restaurant plan, but perhaps it was because there was a local festival going on which they wanted us to go to; we passed it on the way to "Denny's". </p>
<p>The restaurant is obviously popular as we had to wait to be seated. There were a few possible items on the menu for me... one a pasta and tomato dish but served cold, which wasn't appealing at the moment, a gratin with asparagus, and a lasagna, but both of these had meat in them. Akane also asked about the egg salad sandwich at the same time, and the waitress came back saying they could make it without meat. It was delicious with lots of romaine lettuce in it, and fries along with it, a bonus for me! However, the servings here tend to be more modest so I didn't feel guilty about the dozen fries I ate. </p>
<p>Riku had French toast; he ate only about a dozen pieces of it, but pouring the maple syrup over each piece very carefully, so that he didn't run out before the end of them, and then tipping the tiny container right upside down at the end of the it, making sure he didn't miss a drop. While eating it he carefully picked up each piece with the long yellow plastic sword that had held my sandwich together, dipping each piece into the syrup on the plate. This kept him busy for quite a while but then he was restless and wanted to move. A couple of children's books in the entrance way saved the day... "Thomas the Train" in Japanese. </p>
<p>Off we all went, walking very slowly as Riku explored this new area. Auntie Ayako had a few little races with him, which helped a bit, and finally she, Riku, and I ended up walking along a narrow yellow line in the middle of the sidewalk; this was enough action for Riku to keep him out of the way of the cyclists who ride on the sidewalks, often at great speed. </p>
<p>The festival was very small, but Riku and Ayako had fun at the little "fishing" booth, a tub filled with small balls. He was supposed to use a flat and very small net but found that just reaching in and taking the balls was so much more efficient! A young man decked out in full motorcycle regalia captured his attention too; Riku thought he was a robot and was delighted when the man bent down to talk to him. </p>
<p>After wandering around a bit more we headed home, stopping at the shop so that Mr. Goda could oil the squeaky wheels on the stroller. While we were standing outside on our way back to the house, just around the corner, a couple of neighbours stopped by to say hello. They were a mother and pregnant daughter, who pointed out to Riku that there was a baby "in there" pointing to her stomach. Riku said "I see it?"  Another woman from across the way was there too, and all of them made quite a fuss over our boy. Of course Riku is just so open and friendly with everyone so his big smile and sweet face won them over. The last gal said goodbye, returning a couple of minutes later with a little stuffed zebra for him; it is adorable, and Riku held it until he fell asleep in the stroller on the walk home. </p>
<p>We left Mrs. Goda at her place at 3 p.m. Riku held off sleeping for a half hour and then slept until 5:30, with me walking him around a new area the entire time. We did stop first at a new market Akane hadn't noticed before; she bought quite a few big oranges the gal assured her were very sweet; the prices were quite low so it may be a good place to know about. </p>
<p>I knew that Riku would be very hungry after his not very large lunch (he did eat some banana and toast in the stroller) so I made him the new and improved version of Kraft dinner... Trader Joe's whole wheat macaroni with organic white cheddar cheese. I added spinach to it, and while he was waiting to eat, I gave him a plate with the sweetest little cherry tomatoes ever; Riku eats them like they are candy! He ate a very generous portion of the mac' and cheese, and then ate the rest I had already put in the fridge for tomorrow. He topped that off with a cookie Mrs. Goda had sent home with us, and some orange sections. Riku sits at the table so nicely while he eats and I make sure that one of us is sitting with him for company. Akane had curry and rice for her dinner and I made some ginger "chicken" I had brought from home, along with freshly cooked rice and spinach with orange sections... delicious! </p>
<p>After dinner, I cleaned up the kitchen and then washed Riku's hair in the kitchen sink, lying him on a towel on the counter. This worked well and he enjoyed it. I have been encouraging Riku to help undress himself and it's often funny to see the twists and turns he makes trying to get his pants or overalls down, or his shirt over his head. He took his diaper off too, and once again he sat on the toilet before his bath. He doesn't want to sit there too long but at this point it's just a matter of having him comfortable and with an idea of what is supposed to happen. </p>
<p>I had asked Akane to turn the water temperature down on the deep tub for Riku, and at ten degrees lower than is comfortable for Akane, Riku was a happy boy. I first stand him up on the counter of the bathroom sink and soap/wash him down. The tub is not for getting clean but for soaking and relaxing in after washing. The water is much too deep for Riku to sit in; it comes up to his armpits when standing so stand he does. He really enjoys it. I sit on one of the panels on one side and there is another panel on the right; Riku stands between the two, and plays with his watering can, and two bathing plastic containers. What fun he had, splashing about and the water was just right for cooling him off a bit. Akane said it was at body temperature which seemed perfect for Riku... not too chilly getting in, and still warm at the end of the tub time, but not too hot, which Riku does not like at all. He splashed about and I sang him a song about a duck swimming. I think I have two of Kelly's songs mixed in together but Riku was fine with that! </p>
<p>With a clean little fellow all ready for bed, Riku had time for drawing (we have been making coloured dots this past couple of days; he likes me to name the colours as I make them), then he had time with Akane building blocks. I was checking my email during this time and of course he wandered over to see what I was doing; he ended up sitting on my lap while we looked at Tracy and Brad's photos of a trip to Bermuda. At one point he said "there Nana in water" and when I told him it was Tracy he quickly changed the sentence to "there Tracy in water". Riku so enjoys looking at photos, even when they are not of him. Perhaps he will be a Creative Memories consultant when he grows up! </p>
<p>At the end of his day we read his choice of books, "Small Pig", and he flipped back several times to the JUNK YARD page, checking out all the things broken and saying "uh oh!" with such fervor. We named all the letters in JUNK YARD and now when he comes to that page he says 'junk yard", pointing to the words. </p>
<p>He wanted his mommy to tuck him in (I don't lie down with him!) and so off they went, Akane (it turned out) for the evening too, at 9:30. I managed to get one and three-quarters of a blog done and then lost half of the latter! I was so frustrated and went to bed too late, at 12:05 a.m</p>
