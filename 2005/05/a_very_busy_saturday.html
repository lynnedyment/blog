								<h2>A Very Busy Saturday</h2>
								<p>Riku woke up beside me at 6:30 this morning; we stayed in bed for another fifteen minutes, while I told him about all the people in SF (Daddy, Grandpa, Amelia, Auntie Susan, Kevin, Brent, and Lili), all the things at our homes (his own bed, his own room, all his toys, his red chair at Nana's and Grandpa's house, monkey, big mouse, little mouse, his cars in the basket, upstairs with the big box of blocks) and then some of the places we go to (the playground, the backyard with the hose, Ocean Beach, and the zoo). He just lay there so quietly and you could see how much attention he was paying to each and every thing. </p>
<p>Riku wasn't a hungry boy this morning; he did cough a bit and ate only a few bites of yogurt, and some veggie juice, while drawing. He did play very happily for the longest time with his blocks, though, making a huge tower using most of them. I was at the computer while he was busy, and he brought his "<strong>big</strong> tower!" in to show me. Then we sat together and built a bridge out of the blocks Bryn brought back for him, from Manila I believe. I'm not much of an engineering person, but it looked pretty darned good when we finished it; one could drive a car under it, so Riku was very pleased. He drove around in his car for a bit, and was also playing a bit of the devil... opening and closing the big closet in the tatami room where the extra futons and blankets are stored, shutting it quickly when his mom approached! </p>
<p>I went in to shower after answering a couple of emails; when I came out, Riku and Akane were sitting at the table going through the Golden Book memory cards I brought with me. Kelly had given them to me for Riku last trip home. Akane was giving him all the names in Japanese and he was busy repeating them and stacking the cards together after each one. A couple of days ago, I taught him how to even them up once he had a stack of them, and reminded him about that today. He did a great job; one more skill to chalk up on the ever-increasing list of accomplisments these days! </p>
<p>Riku had finished his yogurt during that time; I gave him some grapes and a half slice of cinnamon raisin toast, which he ate before we left for a walk/nap. I had suggested to Akane this morning that we go out to the big department store so I could buy a couple of birthday gifts; the plan was to have Riku nap in the stroller while Akane showered, give him a little lunch, and then walk to Takishamiya.</p>
<p>We left at 10:15, later than I planned, and of course Riku needed to walk a bit first. He is so much happier about making the decision to go in the stroller on his own, and always does as he gets tired after walking for a while. Despite his early awakening, though, today he was quite happy to stroll along the quiet side streets I chose, stopping to collect a few rocks, pressing his nose against a fence, watching the children play in a school yard, admiring the odd cat or dog passing our way, and just generally being interested in his world. </p>
<p>I quite enjoy this quiet meandering time myself. At one point Riku sat down on the tiniest little curb and said "I tired." I asked if he was ready to sit in his stroller and he said "Not yet, I just tired." First time for that phrase! About forty-five minutes after we left he said he would sit and have a snack, which really meant he was tired. He just held on to the cookie container, drank a little water, and was fast asleep within minutes. </p>
<p>Well, I walked and I walked and I walked! this way and every way, down narrow alleyways with very modest and often very run-down homes, past very large and beautifully maintained homes, taking lots of photos again today of futons airing on balconies and railings (it was a gorgeous day and I guess all the housewives were taking advantage of the sun), of an interesting carport arrangement that is very popular here (and which I think would sell very well back home), and of a few other things I thought would make good reminders of my trip. </p>
<p>Riku was still asleep two hours later! I was ready to stop at any time but just kept walking. In total I was gone for three hours! Akane was sitting here ready to go, and no doubt hungry too, as the plan was for us to have lunch out. I thought that we would be home forty-five minutes earlier but there is no way to predict how long a child will nap. He was still a little groggy when he woke up. </p>
<p>I made him a bowl of porridge with cranberries and blueberries, and he ate a modest portion of it, but his appetite is still not up to par. It was late enough now that we decided to take the bus to the store; Riku had had enough sitting in the stroller by that time anyway. And a bus ride! How exciting for Riku; it was just the thing to perk him up and make him look forward to being dragged away from his "buldings".</p>
<p>On the way down to the bus area, we stopped while Akane chatted to one of the shopkeepers. Riku was running back and forth between them and me, when we both spotted Akane's dad coming along behind Akane. Riku was just thrilled to bits! Gigi got a very big hug and a most enthusiastic greeting! He was there to accompany his old friend from high school, who runs the shop, to visit with a third friend in the hospital. It was such a coincidence to run into him, and as a parting goodbye Riku pulled up his shirt to show his grandfather his belly! We all laughed and then dashed to catch our bus, due to leave at 2:10, just minutes away! </p>
<p>It was a very exciting trip. Riku sat beside me and pointed out all the buses, the bridges, the cars ("There is a red car!") and a taxi... very exciting indeed, with such a great view from his window seat. The trip didn't last long enough for Riku though, and we planned to walk home. </p>
<p>First stop... lunch! We went to the same place that we ate in on Mother's Day last Sunday, specializing in tempura. We had the same meal... tempura vegetables for me with kabocha squash (my favourite), green pepper, broccoli, yam, and shiitake mushroom, all served with rice, a few pickled vegetables, miso soup with a bit of seaweed, and a tiny dish with about a tablespoon of delicious potato salad and corn niblets. I could easily have eaten ten times the amount! It was all so good and I offered to buy lunch but Akane insisted it was her treat. </p>
<p>Riku had developed an appetite and ate about half my rice (Akane ordered more as there is no charge for extra rice and tea), a few bites of my squash (Akane ordered him his own piece), one large ebi (shrimp), and some of my soup too. </p>
<p>We did a little shopping around, with lots of running/exploring time for Riku. He needed it and was so happy dashing about, seeing all the interesting things there are in department stores, especially the toy department. Today he discovered a toy microwave oven, and he was so reluctant to leave it! I'm sure he spent a good fifteen minutes putting a 'carrot ' on a plate, pushing the start button, watching it spin around and around, and then pushing the stop button... and beginning the process all over again. I'm sure he was thinking what a perfect addition this would be to his kitchen! </p>
<p>We set off for our walk home about 4:15; it was a gorgeous afternoon, and I was glad to have Akane out enjoying it too. Riku did not nap, much to my surprise, as he was tired again. He sat up nice and straight in his stroller, taking in all there was to see on the way home, chatting away with us and enjoying himself. We arrived home about 5 p.m., and it was certainly too late for a nap by then. Riku was happy to be home playing with his cars; he made a very long train track completely on his own and went crawling along the floor with that, in all three of the main rooms. He was really loud too!!! Every once in a while he does this; he seems to enjoy hearing that voice of his. Akane tried her best to hush him up a bit, to no avail! All that pent up energy had to go somewhere, I guess, and he wasn't being destructive, just <strong>loud</strong>! Very funny really. </p>
<p>Bryn called to speak to him just after this outburst of noise, and he settled in to have a nice long conversation with his daddy. He had been sitting snacking at the table (cheddar cheese and strawberries) and just leaned his head on my arm, letting me hold the phone to his ear, and chatted away, answering questions and filling his dad in on his life. I am quite sure it was the longest phone conversation they have ever had; Riku had so much to say "Oh, yes!", and "Butterfly in here", and "making tunnel and towers", "eating cheese and strawberries" and oh-so-many other things. It was lovely to hear it all. I noticed that he told his dad that he was going on a train, through a tunnel, to the airport, and on a plane with Mommy and Nana. He also said that Grandpa and Daddy and Auntie Kelly would be at the airport. It's so interesting to hear how often Riku mentions Kelly and often the children too. He did tell Bryn that Uncle Gregg would not be at the airport so he is still obviously holding out for Auntie Kelly... if one wishes long enough... and says it often enough... perhaps... </p>
<p>I got to talk with Bryn too, and hear how amazed he was. It was late for Bryn though, and past time for his bed, so I passed the phone to Akane and then coaxed Riku over to me with a book he had brought out from Akane's room earlier. It was in Japanese, but had a few illustrations so he sat on my lap and we looked at and discussed "what's happening?" </p>
<p>Interestingly enough, after Akane got off the phone, Riku asked if he could watch TV. He hadn't watched any today at all, and he did need to slow down a bit before bedtime so we said sure. Akane said she had a video of the book we had been reading, a Russian story from thirty or forty years ago, animated, and with four or five short parts to it. Well, it was adorable; Riku laughed out loud, real belly laughs several times, and of course he enjoyed seeing the alligator, the "angry" woman, the little girl, and the animals we had just been looking at in the book. I like to pull a chair up beside Riku while he watches a show, and often Akane will as well, so we can discuss with him what is going on. I had a hot cup of tea (I was more than ready for it), and eventually Riku wanted up in my lap. </p>
<p>Since he was a little fussy about his food today, I asked him if he would like pasta for dinner or an egg. An egg was his choice and so Akane made him an almost-hard-boiled egg, still a little creamy, a half slice of whole wheat toast cut in long slim pieces, and some chopped fresh tomatoes. He ate every single bite of it; I asked if he wanted a slice of "bacon" and he said "OK", and then I asked if he wanted some dessert and he said "OK", and when the strawberries had been polished off I asked if he wanted half a banana and he said "OK"! and drank some veggie juice too. I told Akane he might explode at any moment. </p>
<p>I suggested (to him) turning the TV off so he could play and off it went! What an amiable little boy this is! He got straight back to work with his vehicles, and while he was playing I asked if he wanted to have a bath tonight. He said "no bath" and went back to his toys. I was so surprised as he really enjoys his tub time, so I knelt beside him and had him look at me, while I explained that I didn't mean a bath right now but a little later. He thought about it and told me "OK, bath time later". </p>
<p>It takes about twenty minutes to heat the water in the tub up, so the timing was perfect. As soon as I suggested that it was time to get undressed, he was up and pulling down his pants. He has been working away at dressing and undressing for days now, and is getting darned good at it. Tonight when we came in, he managed to get both shoes off on his own (he uses a little ledge in the front hall as a wedge... Bryn, you had better come up with a substitute!), then struggled but got both socks off as well. But tonight he took off his own pants (he has to be reminded to pull at the back too!), holds on to the table to step out of them, then struggles with that shirt!, undoes his diaper, and after I roll it up he takes it to the garbage in the kitchen. That is one cute naked little body walking around; Akane and I shared a big smile at the sight of it tonight. </p>
<p>I told him it was time to sit on the toilet and the routine is always the same... he opens the door first (and heaven forbid that you open it!) , then turns on the light... never, ever, the other way around. I popped him up on the toilet, and... drum roll!!!! ... he urinated again! Much clapping ensued and he gave the traditional manly "shake, shake, shake" before getting off. </p>
<p>Akane is not finding her deep hot soaks in the tub very comfortable lately, so after cleaning the tub the other day decided to just partially fill it. Riku enjoyed standing up in it such deep water, but he is also enjoying sitting in the warm water as he can splash madly! and does! without it going all over, or at least anywhere that matters.</p>
<p>Then followed the usual bedtime routine: Akane lays out his diaper, t-shirt, and creams, and I prep him for bed; I told him that his mommy was still sick (she is feeling better though, and the sore throat from yesterday has gone) so he was going to sleep with me. He told me "mommy tuck in" and I assured him that yes, his mommy would tuck him in my bed. They were in the room at 8:15 and Akane was out brushing her teeth at 8:30! </p>
<p>It's now 10 p.m., my blog is done and I am off to bed too. Akane said goodnight a half hour ago... as Riku says "See you tomorrow!" </p>
<p>my p.s. tonight, rather than going all the way up to the right spot to insert it, is:</p>
<p>When Riku and I were building the tunnel this morning we were trying to use up all the pieces; Riku was digging through the box for them and handing them to me. When passing me one he said "One piece in box!" and sure enough, there was just one piece left!</p>
