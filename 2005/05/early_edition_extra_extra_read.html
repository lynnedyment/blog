								<h2>Early Edition... Extra, Extra, Read All About It!</h2>
								<p>Okay, my blogs are already too long and yet there are often extra little things I would like to say; I make notes during the day of fun things that Riku is doing and so have decided that I will just add this little blog in between days... </p>
<p>...Riku and Akane were playing on the bed the other day; they were rolling about, or rather Riku was rolling about Akane, and she trapped him up by her neck. I was busy in the kitchen and heard a loud voice calling out "Nana, come look!"... and look I did, several times over the next ten minutes, at his command! </p>
<p>...Riku was busy in his kitchen making us food, and when it was ready he called out "lunch time!"</p>
<p>... A few days ago, after his lunch and some play time, I asked him if he knew what time it was. He answered with that head lowered, but those eyes looking up at me "Tuck in time?" He has also said "Nap time?" and "Bedtime?". Nice that he knows the routine! </p>
<p>... a first time for this too... "I'm hungry!" ... just before lunch was served. </p>
<p>... after we got home from the Goda's yesterday, Riku wrapped both the zebra and his dog (from my house) up in separate blankets, carrying them around lovingly, giving them kisses, talking to them with a little lilt in his voice... so very sweet. </p>
<p>... Riku is repeating every single thing he hears now; he says "good heavens", "oh my goodness!", "this is delicious!", and so many other things that I can't remember. I really must start writing them down, as he says them so clearly and accurately.  </p>
<p>... He also retells stories very well. Today, while Riku and I were in the lobby, I heard a child crying quite loudly; since he sounded so upset, I thought I would check it out. Turned out that he had somehow gotten locked behind an exit door, so of course I pushed open the door to find a sobbing seven-year-old boy. Riku related the story to me while waiting for the elevator and while in the elevator, and to his mom when we got upstairs. "Boy crying. Nana open door. Door locked. Boy crying. Boy get out"... all said with a worried look on his face. </p>
<p>... and one last one for tonight. Riku does not like it if he thinks I am not pleased with him. Tonight he threw an apple slice on the floor and I told him I was not happy with him. He called to me (I was in the kitchen) and when I looked at him he said "Nana happy?", with a big grin on his face so that I would smile back at him... and when I do, he says "Nana happy." The other day I told him I was cross with him, as he threw a stone into a fountain he had been told not to... and he said "Nana not cross; Nana happy!"</p>
<p>I really am off to bed, it's 11:10, but I just remembered this as well... </p>
<p>... last night before Riku's bedtime we heard a lot of sirens; they were constant for more than ten minutes and I decided I would take Riku outside on the balcony, to see if we could see them. Well, that was just the best thing to do as he was amazed at all the lights, the signs, the flashing neon lights, the traffic headlights, the train going under the road, all the trucks... all of it... and yes, we saw several fire trucks and police cars too, for a long stretch along the highway. I took him outside this morning today; we both reached our hands out to feel the rain, but once again Riku was delighted with the sight of... cranes, men unloading wood in a new "bulding" across the highway, smoke on the left of us, and "dirty smoke" to the right, mountains to the side and across from us, cars, garages, and the sounds of "men working"... "what is that?". Really, it was like a Richard Scarry book come to life... trains going under bridges, big buses, huge trucks, lots of action and movement. We spent quite a few minutes out there checking it all out; it's quite a view from up here on the 29th floor!</p>
