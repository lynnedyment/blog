								<h2>Tom's Last Day at Work... Ever!</h2>
								<p>Well, this is the big day for Tom; his very last afternoon shift. Hard to imagine. We all had a lazy morning at home; Gail and I had a big bowl of Red River cereal, played some cards, while Doug checked his email and got started at the big stack of magazines he brought with him to sort. Tom read the paper, talked to his mom, and showered, packing his last lunch complete with the banana which everyone knows is part of his routine. </p>
<p>Jody arrived at noon to pick me up for my visit with her at her new home in Qualicum Beach. We sat for a while here first, had a cup of herbal tea, and left about 1 p.m. in the drizzle. Stopped at Costco first, Jody signed on as a member, and I bought some shampoo and some camisoles for Kelly and for me. </p>
<p>It is about a forty minute trip to Qualicum, and we chatted away until we reached "Heritage Cottage", which was as lovely as I imagined it would be... original fir flooring, old family photos, antiques, cozy and inviting guest rooms, all light and airy and very homey. It was rainy and the den inviting, so we had some tea while watching Oprah, and then set off for the ten minute walk into town for dinner. </p>
<p>We ate at a new spot for Jody too, as it has just recently opened for dinner. We had a delicious light meal, sharing two quesadillas, with portobello mushrooms and spinach, and the other with fresh tomotoes and basil; a light rice salad and a green salad for each of us on the side was perfect. </p>
<p>Walked home after a stop at the grocery store for whipping cream, for our dessert. We looked at some of the photos from Japan, and all of the wedding pics, before settling down with tea and a most delicious homemade coconut cake in front of the tv to watch a current favourite show of Jody's, "House". It was a long lazy visit and very enjoyable.</p>
<p>We left at 10:15 for the trip back to Nanaimo; Gail was off with Tom at work, having gone with him at 4 p.m. for his last watch and the staff party that would take place over the evening. Doug had finished the last of his magazine sorting, and was looking forward to settling in to read a book. I haven't even begun to sort through my magazines... guess they will wait until Las Vegas. </p>
<p>Bed at midnight, up at 12:30... showered, bed at 1 a.m.</p>
