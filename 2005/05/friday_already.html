								<h2>Friday Already!</h2>
								<p>Did this week go by quickly! Somehow in my mind it was Wednesday today... funny how that happens. I was awake at 5:30 this morning and in the tatami room writing last night's blog (again), when Riku walked in to say good morning. He was in great spirits and his nose not running a bit; we had a typical morning: getting dressed after sitting on the toilet, breakfast, play time with both Mommy and Nana, some drawing, and then his TV show at 8:30 a.m. </p>
<p>The plan was for Akane and me to be ready to leave for city hall (Akane has to go there before she leaves) in time for Riku's nap around 9:30. When I went in to shower, I suggested to Akane that she make Riku a five-minute boiled egg, as she did one for him last week and he really enjoyed it... sliced in half and sprinkled liberally with pepper! I thought this would hold him during his nap and perhaps a later than usual lunch. Unfortunately, Akane misunderstood me and somehow thought that I wanted her to make him an egg sramble so when I finished showering, there was Riku enjoying every bite of a scrambled egg with lots of spinach in it, plus some fresh tomato pieces! Now that was quite the mid-morning snack! </p>
<p>Akane had been up twice in the night and decided she was too tired to leave so soon; we changed our plans to leave after she and Riku had napped together. </p>
<p>I got back to my blog entry but could hear Riku fooling around... running around the bedroom and being much louder than a child going to sleep should be! An hour later he came out, leaving Akane trying to sleep. He of course was now very tired, but also wired from the running around, so off we went to the park with a few biscuits on hand. </p>
<p>The morning had seemed warm and sunny, and we had the sliding doors open, but when Riku and I went downstairs we realized it was cool and breezy so up we went for our sweater and jacket. Riku was happy to find his little stash of rocks near the slide still in order and got busy adding to it. He and another little fellow played together in the sand box for quite a while, and when he was left with just the mom, he started playing with her, handing her rocks and bit of long grass, as well as engaging her in conversation. It never fails to astound me at just how social he is; everyone is his friend! </p>
<p>He climbed up the slide several times but for the past week or so he has not once slid down; he always backs carefully down the ladder, saying "It's ok, don't worry". I asked him today why he wouldn't slide down and he said "too hot." Hmm, it must have been too hot one day when I first arrived and without saying anything about it, just decided the slide was not a good thing to do anymore. </p>
<p>Akane stayed home and slept, and when we walked in an hour and a half later, she had cooked us all some vegetarian fried rice; it was delicious and Riku ate a huge bowl of it, with some "ice cream" and strawberries for dessert. </p>
<p>Akane did not feel well after lunch, so our plans changed once again; By this time Riku was really exhausted and coughing a bit (Akane now has a full-blown cold and a cough as well), so into bed they both went. Riku did go right to sleep this time, thank goodness, and Akane woke up when she heard a delivery man at the door. I was still working on my blog, and Akane went back to bed with Riku. </p>
<p>A while later she came out for some tea, and Riku wandered out shortly thereafter, looking dazed and confused. I picked him up, sat in a chair, covered him up and he was sound asleep in my arms in a minute. I sat and read my book for a while like this; Riku shifted in my arms a couple of times but was breathing heavily and in a deep sleep for another half hour. </p>
<p>He awakened slowly and was not interested in going out to the park (obviously not feeling quite up to par), so we had some quiet time at home. He drew again, drove around in his little car and at one point, busy with the car turned on its side and using his kitchen knives as tools, he called over to me "Nana, fix the engine"! I went over and did my best, which was enough to please Riku. He is really into playacting right now, and wants me to talk to his animals, ask them questions, have them answer, and gets involved himself by using different tones of voice when he speaks. </p>
<p>We all three sat together at 4:30 to watch "ABC" again on tv. A lot of it was a repeat from last night but there were a few new segments as well. One was a little scary for Riku; an animated doctor was dressed up as a knight, with a big sword, and was frightening the "children". Riku stood back quite a few feet by the end of the tatami room door, just barely looking at it. I did tell him it was just a man wearing a mask but until he saw that for himself he wasn't any too keen on being closer. </p>
<p>Riku sat with a place mat on his lap eating a bowl of strawberries and orange segments while watching the show. He likes fruit as much as I do; now if we could only get him eating peas, and beans, and broccoli! </p>
<p>Akane hadn't been outside today, Riku was showing signs of being a little difficult and so I suggested we all go off for a walk in the park. We left at 5:30; it was quite cool, and Riku needed another layer on. Akane was bundled up, wearing Riku's scarf too, and I wished I had put on a long-sleeved blouse. The wind was quite cool, but of course the sun felt good, and there were so many people in the park on bikes, walking their dogs, and with their children in the sandbox area. </p>
<p>A woman sitting there while her child ran around a field practicing for a relay event, took quite a shine to our boy. She and Akane exchanged some information about Riku... how old he is, how much Japanese he speaks, and she was trying to convince her daughter to speak English to Riku, so she could practice on him. She and Riku kicked a ball around, he followed a couple of children up the slide and then went down, as though he had never stopped! </p>
<p>A quick trip to the grocery store for some bean sprouts for Akane; she has a yen for them, and some salmon to make up into rice bowls for them, and back we were at home at 7 p.m. Riku is always ready to eat, and must have been extra hungry today, as he asked for yogurt. I bought a bag of chips for myself downstairs, and Riku insisted on carrying the bag all the way up to our place; I had no idea he would know what they were but he cried when I took the bag from him to put away! So, he was <strong>really</strong> hungry! I asked him if he wanted porridge or pasta and he chose porridge. I commented to Akane that no matter how often I intend to make a smaller portion, I always end up with a big bowl! I split it in half, intending to save the rest for tomorrow. However, Riku ate all but one small bite of it; the reason I end up with so much is because I also put a spoonful of four-grain cereal in it, and cranberries and blueberries and flax seed and wheat germ! It's very hearty, and I like him to eat a bowl once a day. He finished, I asked if he would like some toast. "OK" says he, and when that was done he asked for dessert! Out came a bowl of strawberries, followed by some grapes, which he speared with the tiny sword from the luncheon outing the other day, and finally a very small bowl of potato chips which he ate so nicely, one small bite at a time, obviously loving them as much as his Nana does! </p>
<p>Bath time right after dinner tonight, as it was later than usual. Akane had cleaned the tub out today, and emptied it of water. I hadn't noticed and so when we went in the tub was completely empty! In a way this worked well, as Akane started it running and Riku enjoyed a sit down tub for the first time since I arrived. The water goes in so slowly that he had a lovely, relaxing, leisurely tub time tonight, whilst sitting! </p>
<p>We decided it would be a good idea for him to sleep with me tonight, to avoid lying next to Akane while she feels so tough. He was okay with that, as long as his mommy tucked him into my room, which she did. It's now ten o'clock on the nose, and I am off to bed. Had no personal emails today, except for Bryn this morning, so I shall leave catching up for another day. I'm tired, and so glad that I am once again caught up on my blog!</p>
