								<h2>What a Busy Sunday!</h2>
								<p>What a lovely beginning to my day today... Riku woke very slowly at 6:30, after going to sleep last night at 8:30...  a full ten hours straight through with not one waking period in the night. He was in the same position at 6:30 a.m. as he was last night when I went to bed... head on his pillow and sleeping on his back. I know he rolled over a couple of times but his head stayed on the pillow all night, quite a different boy from the one who rolls all over in his sleep, including on top of Akane! Hope this is a permanent change for his mommy's sake.</p>
<p>He wakens very quietly, or at least did today. I kept my eyes closed and listened to him talking to himself very quietly, and watching his own fingers moving around in the air. Very sweet. His eyes would be open, then he would shut them, and a few minutes later would open them again. I rolled over and said "good morning" and then that beam was aimed right at me! I asked him if he would like to get up, and he said his first "OK!" of the day. </p>
<p>Riku didn't cough all night and only once or twice this morning, but his appetite was a bit off so I guess he is not feeling quite well yet. He did end up finishing his yogurt and half banana, but it took over an hour. He was a busy boy though, playing with me in his little corner of the world. Akane had gone back to bed after being up a couple of times in the night, a typical situation for her unfortunately, so Riku and I had "cake" and "oranges" and today he was into naming the colours of the plates and utensils. "Oh, you have a blue plate." "Oh, your fork is green!" "Have a blue fork!" and he would switch it for me. "What is this?" is his most often-used phrase, I would say. And his response to an answer tends to be to repeat it back to you "Oh, that is light blue!" </p>
<p>We also played planes, trains, and automobiles, as he knows he is going home soon. He repeats several times a day that Daddy and "Blaunka" will be there to see us. I think he is missing his dad for certain, as he often says out of the blue "Where is Daddy?" ... and then, "Oh, Daddy be at airport." </p>
<p>I decided to take Riku out again today for his long morning nap, as we are going to Namba in Osaka to have lunch with Akane's mom. We were to meet at 1:30, which isn't too far off Riku's nap time, so a good nap this morning would have been ideal... but didn't happen. </p>
<p>We left at 10 a.m. Riku walked happily along, exploring as usual, and today he found a fantastic little bug that I have never seen before... it looked as though someone had taken tiny little fine branches and glued them together to form a not-larger-than one inch bug. Riku managed to spot it climbing up a wall; it was so hard to see it as it blended right into the wood, but he had his nose almost right up to it, looking sideways to see it walk. When I peeked at it, it looked as though it had a siphon for a mouth, filled with tiny eggs. It stopped moving completely while we watched and we finally moved on ourselves. How wonderful to have a little person discovering these things I would surely have missed. </p>
<p>I decided to walk to the shopping centre, which is at the next train station. Akane and I walked home from there yesterday, which is when I discovered that I had made it there on my own the day before, within two blocks of it! I wanted to see if I could find it again, this time deliberately. I did, with no problem at all. Riku had been sleeping about forty minutes at this point and, unfortunately, there was a large group of women and children, all standing in a row with their boxes, shouting out for people to donate. A couple of young girls were particularly loud and it woke Riku up; such a shame as he didn't manage to get back to sleep. </p>
<p>On the way home, I spotted a very new and sparkling clean little shop selling Italian gelato (ice cream). I thought what a nice treat that would be for both Riku and me; he loves ice cream and I haven't had gelato in years. A very friendly young woman allowed me to sample the three flavours I was curious about... vanilla with little pieces of dark chocolate mixed in with it, fresh strawberry, and a plain vanilla. I chose the strawberry, as it was so amazingly good!, but will be back for some of the chocolate bits one soon. The plain vanilla was just too bland, but I noticed they had one with vanilla specks so shall try a sample of that one next. Riku and I sat with our tiny spoons, taking one bite each in turn. I helped Riku load up his spoon a bit, as he was enjoying it as much as I was. There were good sized pieces of fresh strawberry in it too. Soooo good! "This is delicious!", said Riku as he was about to drink the last of the melted dessert. I told Akane about it when we got home and since her eyes lit up at the telling, we shall most certainly be going back! </p>
<p>I had misgivings about going out to a nice restaurant with Riku in need of a good sleep. He had thown his new little fire truck (his going-to-the-toilet-successfully gift from me last night) on the ground coming into the building when I told him he could not bring his stick collection into the house. This is an absolutely a sure sign that he needs to sleep; otherwise, he would have just said "ok" when I suggested leaving them where we could find them later. </p>
<p>Akane seemed reluctant to go on her own for lunch with her mom; Riku had an hour to play a bit at home, but did not want to eat much for lunch either... hmmm. I would have chosen to stay home with him, but off we went for a train ride! and to see Baa-baa, both of which Riku was happy about. Getting him into the stroller was a smart move, as he was tired enough to just lay back a bit and relax. Our train at 1:07 was delayed because of an accident (this happened the other day too), and so we took a later one, and then a subway, meeting Mrs. Goda a half hour later than planned. </p>
<p>Lunch was a real treat for me; Mrs. Goda had decided we should go to a restaurant that specializes in tofu dishes, one of my very favourite foods. They gave me a wonderful selection of non-meat and seafood dishes, and every single one of the perhaps dozen dishes was just a delight... mostly one- or two-bite tastes... tofu cubes, a soup with tofu skin in a wonderful broth, a pasty so-good dab or two of prepared tofu served with a zingy mustard, and others I can't recall right now. Oh, I had a tofu salad... greens... watercress and lettuce, with a delicious dressing and all served on top of a soft and flavoured tofu. We had a nice good sized pot of mixed rices with tiny bits of vegetable in it, and sweet plum wine (I also got to drink Akane's peachy-tasting one), lots of tea, and then finished off with the most amazing tofu dish I have ever had. It honestly, truly, tasted like one of the best crème brûlées I have had... I would never in a million years thought that it was made with tofu. The caramel sauce served on it, was delicious as well... and Mrs. Goda bought us each one to take home! </p>
<p>Riku had a few bites of his grandma's lunch; theirs was served in a very large basket with a top layer of separated areas for the little dishes holding different foods... Mrs. Goda also bought Riku a wooden box with rice in it; he ate a few bites of it too, using the tiny spoon it came with. I must get a photo of it; stay tuned for photos of our lunch dishes! </p>
<p>Riku nursed about halfway through the meal; he was so tired and couldn't be expected to sit still and quiet for much longer. Akane asked if he would like to nurse and he was over on her side of the table in seconds! Such a lucky boy; Akane was still eating but he fell fast asleep nursing and I managed to get him into his stroller successfully after we had finished eating. Whew! He slept for almost two hours, despite the noise of the huge underground walkways leading from one area to another, and in the stores and elevators as well. </p>
<p>Mrs. Goda bought herself two beautiful new outfits at a display of exclusive clothing and craft displays; one of her favourite designers was there, and she introduced Akane and me and showed off Riku sleeping soundly. I was so afraid that one of them would waken him up as a few of the women, in their enthusiasm, would either go too closely or speak too loudly into the stroller! I got him moving asap! </p>
<p>I spotted a nice navy skirt that I pointed out to Akane, and she realized it had an elastic waist. No price on it, so a woman offered to get her someone who ran that booth, to help her. By this time, Mrs. Goda had finished purchasing her second outfit, came over and started to bargain down the asking price considerably. It was funny to see actually, as the two women were kind of batting away at each other with their hands, laughing but both being very serious about their positions!  Mrs. Goda won! Akane has a new skirt and top, courtesy of her mom. </p>
<p>We wandered around Takashimaya for quite a long time; Mrs. Goda is a shopper! I can see where Akane learned to love just poking through stores; she learned from a master! It seemed we were up and down elevators all afternoon, but it was fun as long as I could keep moving Riku along. I bought myself a pair of the slippers I love, just to have a spare on hand at home. Mrs. Goda bought Riku a set of twelve new cars, a "special colour collection of Tomika cars". Before giving it to Riku, we went off to have tea. It was in a small open restaurant/tea room and we ordered tea and two orders of scones. I asked Akane if the tea was really $7 each and she verified that yes, it was. We were each poured one cup of tea and then a pot of very nice Assam tea was put on the table. The scones were delicious but not huge; Riku and I shared an order of two small scones, and Akane and her mom shared the second... freshly whipped cream and blueberry jam. Riku was just delighted with his dessert and I have a photo of him to prove it. I treated for tea; it was the only time I have been allowed to pick up the tab. </p>
<p>Mrs. Goda had to leave, and I suggested to Akane that she give Riku the cars first so she would see his reaction; it was all a grandmother could hope for... the smile and the genuine delight could not have been any better! He carried the big box on his lap all the way to the train station. We did stop first at Muji to pick up a couple of small items, and then headed for home at 6:35! What a long day out for Riku, with much of it spent in his stroller. Tomorrow he is going to spend lots of time running and walking outside. </p>
<p>We did have a short but such a nice evening with him before he went to bed though. Akane went to the grocery store for more strawberries for Riku, his veggie/fruit juice mixture, and Kleenex. Riku and I came right upstairs, with him running the full length of the long outdoor hallway to our building. He wanted to be the one to open the door to the building before the family walking behind us did; I must admit I was coaxing him to run, as I wanted to get those little legs moving a bit. </p>
<p>The minute he had his sandals off (first time entirely on his own!), he asked for his new cars. I opened up the set and he sat at the table lining them all up and then asking me, and pointing at each one separately, twice, "What colour is this one?" Of course he knows most of the colours already, but there was a gray one, a beige, and a burgandy, all new to him and perhaps he didn't want to admit to it! </p>
<p>He asked for a banana, ate about half of the oatmeal with cranberries he told me he didn't want, asked for more banana, and since Akane had had to substitute "American Cherries" for strawberries (they ran out), he also had three cherries cut in two. $1.78 for twelve cherries! Did he love those cherries! They were gone in less than a minute, but since he threw a piece of banana on the floor and didn't eat the rest of it, we are saving those cherries for a boy who is less tired tomorrow. Riku knows when he has done something he shouldn't have and doesn't argue the fact.</p>
