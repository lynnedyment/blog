								<h2>Friday in West Vancouver</h2>
								<p>Ah, what a wonderful sleep I had, with the sound of flowing water from the creek running behind our bedroom at Judi and Con's. Judi and Con were both out of the house early so we took advantage and showered in their big wonderful shower "room"... no door, no curtains, no tub. </p>
<p>We left the house around 11:30 a.m. after polishing off a nice plateful of delicious organic strawberries. I stopped in at the local doctor's office to get a prescription renewed; had my blood pressure checked... excellent, and he suggested that I get some blood work done, including a fasting thyroid test. </p>
<p>We were both hungry and had a hard time trying to decide where to eat... "Sewell's" in Horseshoe Bay for some wild salmon? Dundarave for fish and chips? But they only gave me about seven big fries last time so that was out. "Milestones" at Park Royal? I know that Tom and Gail really like it, and Doug has never eaten there. Hmmm. </p>
<p>First though I wanted to take a photo of the little mailbox train that has been on lower Marine Drive since Kelly and Bryn were young. Did that and then decided that since the Dundarave bakery had closed that I had better get a photo of "Dundarave Fish and Chips" as that was such a favourite spot over the years; it was where I took Brooke for a special treat when it was just the two of us. </p>
<p>Alas, that too had disappeared and is now a boutique! Argggh! The old IGA is being renovated and when we lived here it was Stong's. We stopped in at "Capers" with their huge selection of ready-to-go foods and bought eight lovely small tarts for dessert tonight, three lemon curd, three chocolate orange and two mixed berry flans. </p>
<p>We wandered along the small block of stores and were astounded as to how many new places have gone in since we were here last. One of them was a bakery/cafe which sounded promising, "The Bakehouse Cafe". It was a great choice... they had samples of their most delicious very large cinnamon buns, so we had one of those, Doug had a bowl of vegetarian chili, and I had a small bowl of spinach/lentil soup and a half sandwich of Brie, avocado, tomatoes and cranberry chutney. It was as good as it sounded and served on very tasty crusty bread. I ate a third of the cinnamon bun too... yum! </p>
<p>Decided to head back to Judi's and leave some of our other errands until tomorrow. Judi, Taryn, Con, John, and Brooke were all here and after sitting for a few minutes we all went off to the club where the wedding is being held, taking all of the bridal party's dresses, suits, shoes, along with a sound system and other necessary items for the big day. Judi, Brooke, and I went in one car and stopped to pick up nine boxes of individual ice cream cakes in insulated bags. Traffic was terrible going over the bridge but we had the air-condioner on to keep the "cake" frozen. </p>
<p>Doug spent the afternoon cropping over five hundred photos of Japan for me! I did manage to delete over a hundred yesterday and a few more this morning. </p>
<p>Up to the suite which will be the dressing room for tomorrow and then the bridle suite for tomorrow night. Judi was expecting out of town guests for dinner and one couple had arrived by the time we got back to the house. Everyone pitched in with dinner.... barbecued chicken tended to by Colin, Judi did a huge pan of roasted potatoes, corn was prepared and cut up by Diane, I made the salad and the table was set outside with all the food laid out in the dining room. We had wine, lots of good company and laughs, and the food was so good. It was a gorgeous night and it was lovely to have both "the girls" there with us. The groom was out for the evening with an old friend from out of town.</p>
<p>We all cleared up the kitchen, Judi made tea and coffee, and we sat chatting outside until the mosquitos drove all but Doug and Colin inside. We chatted for a bit more, Brooke drove the one couple back to their hotel and the rest of us headed up to bed at 11:15. Taryn and Brooke are sleeping in the same bed tonight, as the rest of the house is booked... and it's hot out there! </p>
<p>Tomorrow is the big day!</p>
