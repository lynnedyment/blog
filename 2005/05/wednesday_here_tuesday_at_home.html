								<h2>Wednesday Here, Tuesday at Home</h2>
								<p>I had a very early start to my day today, with Riku awake before 5:30 a.m.! I had slept from 10:30 to 4:30, then read and dozed for the next forty-five minutes, and that was that for the day. Yawn!!!! ... but then Riku keeps me going for the rest of the day, with not much time to think whether I am tired or not. He has enough energy for all the wondrous things out there for both of us. He walked into my room at 5:45, with his big smile, just so happy to begin a new day. Who could resist?</p>
<p>I quickly put together his berries/yogurt/toast daily special, and once he had polished that off, Akane came in with a five minute boiled egg, sprinkled with a generous amount of freshly ground pepper and he polished that off too! </p>
<p>I came into the tatami room to delete my junk emails and just as he did yesterday, Riku went into his whirling dervish mode, spinning, swirling, and really being loud, enjoying every minute of it, just as he did yesterday. Today, however, he stood with his legs spread way out, put his head on the floor making a bridge, and peeked at me with the biggest grin on his face. He howled when I got down on my fours to do the same for him. He spent five minutes crawling under my bridge, as I turned from one end to another so he could see my face between my legs first. Good thing I don't have high blood pressure! </p>
<p>After showering I went to have a light breakfast, starting with a banana. The other day Akane and I had a discussion where she told me that my Bryn and Riku don't care for bananas and she had stopped buying them. I need them for the potassium and of course they are high in fibre, so I commented that it was a shame that Riku didn't like them as they are so good for him. Well, I think he was listening as I had shared a banana with Akane, which Riku spotted, wanted it and then ate the other half of my second one! Now he is a daily banana guy, just like his Grandpa! </p>
<p>This boy needed his nap, so I decided to take him out in the stroller for a change; it would be cooler and I could use the long walk. We left the apartment at 9:15 a.m. He had asked Akane for "pain".... the Japanese use the French word for bread, and Akane told me Riku's favourite.... a long sweet dough bun with a glaze of sugar on top.... called a Danish roll here. There is, too handily, a wonderful bakery just downstairs, with very friendly staff, and which I am trying hard to ignore this trip! Riku sat happily in his stroller eating it and five minutes later was sound asleep. So much for the theory of sugar hyping up children! </p>
<p>I walked steadily for two hours! Why I don't weigh 100 pounds, I would like to know! There was a nice cool breeze and so was perfect for his nap and for my walking him. Riku napped for eighty minutes of our time out; it wasn't quite long enough as he just lay there on the final few blocks home, not sitting up and being chatty as usual. I walked a good long way along a road that ran beside a train track. It was an interesting walk and I took several photos... duvets and comforters hung up to air, not five feet from the train tracks(!), very old dilapidated buildings standing right next to quite lovely and large modern homes, with beautiful gates, old tile roofs, and beautiful landscaping. So many folks ride bikes here, and I am amazed at how many of them appear to be in their seventies and eighties. I was also very surprised to see an elderly man urinating in an empty clay flower container (but no flowers) right in public with no obvious sense of being uncomfortable as I walked by. Akane told me later that this is very common. At home only a homeless person would do this, or a drunk, and not so openly either but here the feeling is that if nature calls then you answer the call. Sounds fine to me; he wasn't being obvious, just doing what needed doing. </p>
<p>Back at home, Akane was preparing <em>pad thai</em> for our lunch, a lovely treat indeed. Much better than the peanut butter on toast I had planned; I was hungry too, as I had forgotten to eat some almonds after my not-half banana(!), and so the lunch was especially welcome. Riku and I played with his blocks while Akane finished cooking, and preparing a slightly pickled carrot and cucumber dish, which was delicious as well. I also snuck in a little msn chat with Bryn before lunch as well.</p>
<p>Riku didn't eat much of his lunch, but a half hour later he finished every bite of the pasta dish from last night (one and a half servings of it) and a half dish of leftover oatmeal with strawberries. He was soon drooping with tiredness, not having napped quite long enough this morning to make up for that much-too-early awakening.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the bedroom was too warm and Riku slept only forty minutes, but I held him and he immediately went back to sleep. Akane came in and turned on the air-conditioning and he slept another hour. Whew! </p>
<p>Akane did not feel great today; she napped in the morning with Riku and again in the afternoon, so when Riku and I went to the little playground downstairs, I suggested that she bathe and come and meet us  there. Akane enjoys her bath time and so far I have managed to be out with Riku during that time so that she can bathe at her leisure in a quiet house. </p>
<p>The very friendly mom was there again with her two children; I thought the younger one, three months younger than Riku, was a girl, but later in the evening Akane told me that she was sure the woman was referring to the child as a "him"... another pretty boy in our midst! Riku was so delighted to have company again, and today he played with a pushcar and a tricycle as well as wandering in his "woods". I fed him snacks as he played and he also shared some candy from the other mom. </p>
<p>Akane did join us, and had a chat with the mom; we mostly smile at each other although she does speak a bit of English... could ask where I was from... Canada, and San Francisco... and we managed to communicate with gestures. However, it was very nice for Akane to meet her; this family lives in the  buidling opposite ours, and so far she has been in the playground each day around 4 or 4:30 for an hour or so. After twenty minutes we all gathered up our sand toys, and off we went to the grocery store for water (we get one free jug a day), butter, and bananas! </p>
<p>Riku and I strolled on ahead to the condo building, and he delighted two women with his door opening skills! They smiled and chortled away at him, and he smiled back. of course, waving and saying "buh bye! as we dashed to push the buttons on the elevator before they could! We started playing an elevator game the other day... as we wait for one of the four to appear, I say... "I wonder which elevator is going to come first? I think <strong>this</strong> one!", and point to one. Riku then looks around, chooses one and says "I think <strong>this</strong> one!" and then we wait to see who won. I call out "I won!" or Riku calls out "I won!" and sometimes of course I have to say "no one won" which Riku repeats after me. </p>
<p>Dinner time... whole wheat "'mac' and cheese" as they say in the States. I brought some Trader Joe's ww with organic white cheddar "Kraft dinner" equivalent with me, and it was a hit with our little man. I added finely chopped spinach to it, as well as saut√©ed mushrooms; Riku ate two really good-sized helpings of it, and then ate lots of cherry tomatoes, apple slices, and another whole banana! Akane was really amazed at how much he is eating and we laugh about the banana business every time he asks for one. </p>
<p>After dinner, Riku got busy in his little kitchen again, asking if we "Want dinner?" Sure... and I told him I would like mushroom soup. He stirred and added several shakes of all possible shakes, brought it over to me, "ate" some himself, but when Akane asked for a taste he told her no. Riku does not always like to share his food and we are working on it. He did serve both of us several pieces of the little cake from his new set, though, and had a thorough discussion with Akane in Japanese about "what is this?" while pointing to the icing, the little green decoration, and the strawberries on the top of each slice. I think he knew about the strawberries but was double checking just in case. </p>
<p>The evening ended with story time, as usual, after some more building time. We read "Franklin" and "Are You my Mother?"... but before heading to bed, he sliced up more fruit and veggies with his knife and "clean up, clean up" leaving his kitchen in perfect order. His mom tucked him in at 9:15 and ended up staying there herself. I turned in at 11:15... too late again, but at least I managed to send off an email to Doug and get my first blog written... good thing I have been keeping a detailed journal or the past few days would have been a blur! ... busy, busy days here... and such fun to have this big block of time here with Riku and Akane.</p>
