								<h2>And Saturday Flies By!</h2>
								<p>Our little fellow woke up at 6:30 this morning; I heard him playing in the dining room/living room, so decided to stay in bed and read for a bit. I was awake in the night, scratching once again! Akane told me tonight that one of the first words Bryn learned in Japan was the world for mosquito, and I know why! </p>
<p>I quickly checked my emails, although had nice long ones from Gail and Doug to read this morning, so did that before sitting on the floor to play with Riku. He has been doing a funny thing the last couple of days; he will come to me and say "TV?" I always look at him and say "TV???? Noooo, you are just bored! How about making me some porridge (or tea, or whatever)?", and off he goes. I think he just wants a suggestion of something better to do as he never asks twice! Today he was busy making me an egg (Akane had bought him a very lifelike hard boiled play egg), so he cut it in two and gave us each half.  We also had porridge, toast, and tea, and changed utensils several times. He would give me a blue fork, reach over and take it back, saying "Oh, sorry", and give me a red one! He is quite the little Canadian; someone will bump into him and he automatically says "Oh, sorry!"</p>
<p>I was in the shower very early, as we were out the door at 9 a.m. to the park. Akane did some laundry, and showered while we were out. We did our usual wander over to the quiet park, Riku pushed the walk button in both directions, and we checked out the sandbox for other children. No one there today, so I thought we would go to the "Shopping Road" to buy something to soothe these bites of mine and Riku's. He hasn't started scatching yet, but his are quite large and I imagine they will be itching at some point. </p>
<p>Just as we were leaving, a little girl and her mom showed up; Riku immediately changed directions and went right over to her. Once again, it was so sweet to see; these two little ones playing together so very nicely, with Riku handing over some of his best stones (his little stash of "'tones and 'ticks" are still where he left them a few days ago) while she handed them every so nicely back! I indicated to her mom, after a bit of "chatting", that Riku and I both had bites; she went into her bag and offered up some roll-on cream. I used it on Riku's bites and asked if she would write it down for me; I planned to just show this to the pharmacist. The child will be two in June and despite the language problem we were still able to ask and answer some questions about the children and where we live. Everyone understands "Canada" and "San Francisco". Eventually another girl Riku's age joined them while they sat on a bench and had their drinks. </p>
<p>We were scheduled to meet Akane at 10:20, and I wanted us both to go to the toilet before heading off to Mrs. Goda's. I hadn't planned any stops along the way, but the two women in the clothing store spotted us and came scooting out to say "ohayo" to us. Of course they know we are leaving soon, and the owner wanted to take Riku's photo. She took a couple, one with him pulling one of his new and very funny faces, and another with a smile. I took one of them both with Riku as well. I think it will be fun to remind Riku of these new acquaintances of his. </p>
<p>Now we were really dashing, but it was worth the trip as Riku once again went to the bathroom. He is very willing today and says "OK" each time I ask him. I think a BM is not far off, if this is kept up. Riku sits quite comfortably on the toilet and is willing to sit just a little longer each time. </p>
<p>Akane had lost track of the time, so was ten minutes late coming down. It was already warm out, and we set off at a good pace towards her mom's, arriving just ten minutes late. Riku had fallen asleep after his usual stroller snack. Today's consisted of orange sections, and a few apple slices, then half a slice of buttered toast and one cookie, and he had the dried fruit for later on in the day. We reached the Goda's before Riku woke up, so I found a shady street and walked up and down until Akane and her mom joined us. Riku woke just a minute before this, so the timing was perfect, a fifty minute nap. </p>
<p>We walked quite a good distance to the restaurant, "cutting" through a park, although with Riku with us it took longer to go through the park than if we had gone around it... all those sticks and rocks to collect! Today Riku found a great piece of branch with bark peeling from it and a curved and quite long stick. He is so very willing to find a good place to leave these treasures; I tell him we have to find a good place for them, and he starts looking around. Today it was under a "big tree!" and he left them there happily. Riku is such an easygoing little boy (except when he is overtired or hungry, that is, and I've been working hard to avoid either situation). </p>
<p>The restaurant Mrs. Goda chose was really lovely. We sat at a big table with room underneath for our bare feet, and Riku was sitting beside me on a large cushioned platform. He had a window to look out of, and lots of room to wriggle about in, and then lots of shrimp to eat as well! Mrs. Goda had arranged for me to have a vegetarian plate of tempura, although it did have two battered shrimp on it. Riku was more than happy to eat them (although I did snap off those tails first!) and then ate the tiny shrimp on our appetizer plates too. He ate two tiny baby corn cobs, quite a few of my cold thin noodles, a bit of rice, and a little tofu and veg' that Akane had packed up. I had ordered the yam rice as it sounded intriguing but unfortunately was served with an undercooked egg in the middle of the sauce I was to pour over it. Even though Akane took the egg out, the somewhat slimy tecture of the yams was just a little too close to the uncooked whites I had seen hanging about! I am really sqeamish about undercooked eggs. The tempura was light and delicious; Mrs Goda ordered me extra so I had a wonderful mushroom, a long asparagus stalk, a very generous piece of kabocha squash, and a very mild chunk of onion.... so good! Akane traded her ginger rice with shredded tofu for my untouched rice dish; it was delicious. We had hot tea, and cold water, both of which hit the spot as we sat there enjoying the leisurely pace of our lunch. Riku played with the container of toothpicks and nibbled away until he was ready to move on. </p>
<p>Our after-luncheon tea was served in a very large and comfortable room next door. We sat on leather chairs and had a cup of very good tea. Riku had been served his own iced tea in the restaurant and did he ever enjoy it! He kept repeating "This is <strong>my</strong> tea" and drinking away at it steadily. He also took big sips of his Baba's iced tea in the next room. He and I went off to the toilet, Japanese style this time, and Riku went too. I am so glad he doesn't mind going in public bathrooms as some children do. He went running in to his Baba saying "I went on toilet!" in English, but she understood him well enough; toilet is the same word or at least there are almost always signs that say "TOILET" in English. </p>
<p>The best part of lunch for Riku was the very large and real buffalo head in the lobby! He went running after his Baba when she went to the bathroom first and came running back to us, saying "Big! big "Come see. Big!" and was it ever! He wanted to be picked up to touch it, and of course he could only reach as far as the chest. He really wanted to touch the horns, but that would have required a ladder! The hostess was quite taken with Riku; she said that most children are afraid of it, and was amazed by his interest and enthusiasm. </p>
<p>Mr. Goda had been called to pick us up and go with us to a City Garden Store, which none of them had been to before. They had beautiful flowering bonsai on display and three tanks of fish which Riku would have liked to have visited with all afternoon. He and I hung back and looked at the tiny fish darting back and forth; I think he needs a goldfish at home. </p>
<p>We all wandered around looking at whatever interested us, and for Riku that meant exploring all the different pathways he could find, especially if it meant he could lose track of us! I was kept very busy! However, the nicest part of this day was seeing Riku reaching out to take the hand of a very elderly woman who was walking along with a large group of senior citizens. Many of them were in wheelchairs, and most of the others had canes, but this woman was managing on her own. Another woman had reached out to take Riku's hand, but he didn't see her and took the other woman's. She was so obviously the object of envy as every one of them were watching and oohing and ahhing over Riku. It was the sweetest thing to see. I did get a photo of them from the back. </p>
<p>Oh, important item... I asked Akane to ask her Mom for a suggestion for the bites. She told her the very same name as the gal at the park had recommended. I tried to buy some when I went in to buy another set of batteries, but no luck. Mrs. Goda had her husband stop at a pharmacy and came out with a tube for me and one for Riku, a child's version. Yahoo! Smells like camphor, very familiar. I put it on both of us immediately as Riku had started scratching the large one on his upper arm. </p>
<p>We left there to go to the Japanese Garden; Mr. Goda dropped us off and we walked a bit into the loveliest garden... very traditional Japanese garden, with the requisite waterfalls, beautifully placed rocks and stones, bridges over rushing waters, beautifully landscaped garden areas, and resting areas with benches; we started the walk off with green Japanese tea, the thick foamy traditional tea. I enjoyed it very much although I wasn't sure I was going to. Riku enjoyed the three little cookies served with it! ... and he liked the bit of tea that I gave him at the end of my first cup. Mrs. Goda ordered me a second cup after seeing that I enjoyed it. We were sitting outside on benches, beside a pool filled with koi, being fed by visitors. The woman who served us tea bowed first and gave me the most beautiful of the three bowls of tea; she "presented" it to me, but first turned the bowl around so I could admire its design. It was casual but lovely in this perfect setting. </p>
<p>Riku was off and running as soon as the cookies were gone. What a time he had here! I was expecting him to crash at any moment, but he was obviously so very happy wandering around at his own pace (we were always far behind Akane and her mom). You can't imagine how many wonderful stones there are in a Japanese garden! He loved the stone bridges and rocky pathways and on the narrow or high ones you could hear him say "It's okay, it's okay" and it always was. He is getting very independent about walking down steeper steps now, but is still that cautious "first born" child... unlike Amelia, who has no fear whatsoever! </p>
<p>Just toward the end of our very long time here, Riku did wear down at last. He threw a stone and was ready for the stroller, although he didn't think he was. I gave him his dried fruit snack and a big drink of water, along with my last three little cookies from tea. He was almost asleep as we walked to the train station, but roused as he heard the train come in; he could have used a wee "toes-up" but it didn't happen. </p>
<p>Mrs. Goda said goodbye at the first stop and we got off at home at the second. I had Riku walk as soon as we were in the station; he was quite annoyed that two women were standing by the end of the railing he had been trailing his hand along all along that walk. He stood beside them saying "No woman, no woman" but of course they had no idea what he was implying, which was to get out of his way! Yes, Riku was very tired and it was showing. </p>
<p>I knew he was hungry; he had been so very busy and had been awake too long, which requires more food than usual. I suggested some quiet TV for him, while I made his whole wheat macaroni (that great Kraft dinner substitute) with spinach, mushrooms, and fresh tomatoes, but he had eaten a side dish of cherry tomatoes while he waited. Give him a pick and something to pick up with it, and he is a happy boy for a while. It was just 4:30 at this point, and we had had lunch at noon, but he ate a full bowl of dinner, asked for yogurt, ate all of that, and then ate 98% of my wonderful tofu pudding. </p>
<p>Of course, on my mind all day was how to fit in the gelato visit! The owner had promised to make both custard and coconut and we leave in three days... and they are closed on Monday. I thought that Akane and her mom would be going on to visit Mrs. Goda's mother after the garden, but that has been postponed until tomorrow. It was just too late. So, my plan was to have an early dinner, get Riku into the tub immediately (although I did sit and watch some of "A Bug's Life"  with him on my lap... he likes to talk about "What is happening?"). He wasn't too happy to stop watching until I told him that we were going to go for gelato after the tub. First that ever-important visit to the toilet; another successful visit, and it was obvious he had to have a BM. He really rushed in after his now ritual toilet pattern.... he has to open the door himself first, then turn on the light (nothing cuter than watching that naked little body strettttching up to get that light switch on!), then he <strong>has</strong> to put the lid up... if it's up, then he puts it down and lifts it himself (it's obvious he is not impressed with whomever left it up!... "<strong>Oh</strong>, seat <strong>up</strong>!") and then, and only then can he be lifted up on the toilet. When he is finished "shake, shake, shake!" I get him down, he immediately puts the seat lid down, flushes the toilet, stretches way up to wash his hands in the tiny sink behind and above the toilet, first one and then the other, and dries them on the towel which we moved so he could reach it. Then he leaves, shutting the door first!, and then turning off the light. Quite the procedure here, and it never varies! </p>
<p>I didn't put his diaper on, as he said he had to have a BM, and he sat on the chair, watching a bit more of the movie, Both of us thought he was going to go on the toilet as he seems ready; even being willing to sit without the diaper on was a great sign, but alas nothing happened tonight. I imagine it is going to before morning, but not on the toilet. (Sorry about all this bathroom detail, but it's what is happening in our lives right now!) </p>
<p>So, in he went, with both the cloth frog and the rubber duck having BMs on various tub toys... another good sign. Akane went out to buy a book for her sister, and we agreed to meet downstairs at 6:50. Riku played in the tub until 6:35, and went to the bathroom again; I put on all his various creams and dressed him again. Off for gelato! Riku wanted to walk again but we wouldn't have made it there before closing at the rate we were going; Akane carried him for a bit and then I took over. He is building up my bones for me, this boy!... 12.8kg tonight! We talked about how many stores were closed, how dark it was getting, and how we had to hurry so the man wouldn't lock the store. "No man lock 'tore! Man open door. No close!" </p>
<p>The owner himself was serving the gelato tonight; he greeted us warmly and had made the custard gelato for me, promising the coconut tomorrow. Akane says I am getting special treatment, and I guess I am. He gave me a sample of his black cherry gelato, and it was soooo good, but so was the custard. Akane suggested I have both for only 80 yen (pretty much 80 cents as well) more so I did. However, the double is usually served in a cone and I don't care for cones, so he made an exception and piled up a cup with a very generous amount of both! Riku has his regular strawberry sorbet, with a very generous foray into both of my flavours and so didn't finish his own tonight. He really liked the big black cherry I gave him. So, now I have to get back there tomorrow.... </p>
<p>It was very dark walking home; Riku's eyes were almost closed just as we reached our "big bulding!", and so I lifted him up and gave him the key. Poor wee tyke could hardly manage to keep those eyes open. I wish I had just put him in his pjs before we left; he wasn't thrilled about changing, but did go to the bathroom again, and I brushed his teeth. He ran right into the bedroom and lay down on his pillow, waiting for his mom to brush her teeth and wash. I sang to him a little bit until she arrived. Tucked in at 8:10 ... asleep by 8:30. </p>
<p>A little side note... keep intending to mention a little game that Riku and I play now, and have for several days. I ask as we are leaving the elevator coming upstairs, if he wants to go to the left or the right. He usually chooses right, and off we go in different directions to our front door. He races and races to beat me there and the last corner he turns he is squealing with determination to beat me! It is hilarious. I often make my feet sound as though I am running to make it even more exciting.... </p>
<p>Always while strolling, Riku will ask me to "sing song about farm and a chicken"... and into Old MacDonald I go.... may have mentioned this before... but Bryn, you must remember this so you know what to sing! </p>
<p>... and a last note for tonight. Riku likes to identify people as they come into the elevator; there are times I really hope they don't speak English. Last week a teenager with long hair got in and Riku pipes up "woman in there" and an older man got on next, with a bad wig I think, and again "woman in there". Sometimes he says "that a man" or "that a big boy" ... but he's not always right. It is difficult at times, I can see.... some girls have short hair and some boys have long... confusing when one is just two years old. </p>
<p>Tomorrow ... a hair cut for Riku! Not something he is looking forward to; we will do a little playacting tomorrow and see what we can do about this. We will have the morning and early afternoon at home together while Akane and her mom visit with their grandmother/mom. </p>
<p>Time is 10:10... night night!</p>
