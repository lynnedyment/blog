								<h2>Friday Already! ... and Riku's First Visit to the Dentist</h2>
								<p>Riku had dreams twice in the night, and I woke for both of them, going to sleep and having one of my own... thought I had lost the digital camera again! I was awake at 2 a.m. and didn't get back to sleep until after 3 and then woke again when Riku did at 4. I was too warm, tried reading, and was very busy scratching away at my heel on one foot and my bit toe! on the other. I am having a reaction to some bug here! Yikes! I got up to get a cold cloth and slept with it wrapped around my toe with the other foot against it. Ater finally drifting off, heard Riku again at 6 a.m. He came right into my room this morning and so up I got. </p>
<p>Before Riku could ask for yogurt today, I made him a scrambled egg, "bacon", and tomatoes, with a side of toast. He ate everything but some of the toast. "I like this bacon!" said Riku; me too! We read "Are You My Mother?" this morning during breakfast; Riku really pays attention to all the little details, and seems to find something new each time to comment on. Today I asked him if he would like a big worm for dinner, and his answer was "No, too dirty". </p>
<p>I popped into the shower early, with grand plans for the day... a walk and a short nap for Riku, which did happen. A cute thing happened when we were leaving, though; he always says goodbye to Akane, gives kisses, and waves both hands goodbye to her at the door. Today he leaned over to where she was sitting, rubbed her forehead and said to her in Japanese... "feeling good?" Akane smiled at him and said yes, she was. </p>
<p>He often points to all of us and names us... "Mommy", "Nana", "Riku". We walked out to Rainbow City, a huge mall complex with many high-end American chain stores... Timberland and Brook Brothers come to mind. I wanted to buy a nice big pad of drawing paper for Riku like he has here, so that I can keep his drawings in one place. Riku walked, as always, when we first set out at 9 a.m., and a half hour later was sitting happily in his stroller eating strawberries, half a banana, two little cookies, and some crackers. Five minutes after finishing those he was fast asleep, and slept for forty-five minutes. Perfect, as I wanted him to have a long afternoon nap today. He was to have his first appointment with the dentist at 4 p.m. </p>
<p>I bought the pads of paper first, and then we headed immediately upstairs to the second floor toy area. How he loves this place, and once again played with the water wheel set, and ended up playing with a little girl in the same kitchen he has here. They were so darling, both mixing things and one of them pouring tea for the other, opening the oven and dishwasher, sorting out the dishes and cutlery. They were so cute together that I took several photos and got the mom's address so I could send her a couple of the photos if they turn out well. </p>
<p>Riku was upset when we left, and not very pleased with me at all. I knew he was still tired, with that reaction, so decided to feed him before leaving the mall, rather than have him wait until we got home. This way, with a full tummy, he might sleep. I bought a container of strawberry yogurt and a fruit bun, and he ate them both. However, he did not fall asleep as planned; there were just too many interesting things out there to look at today... a big hole being dug, lots of contructions vehicles, an ambulance racing by... so I thought that was fine. He could nap at home instead. </p>
<p>Akane had expected us for lunch and had made a nice big bowl of the same Chinese sweet and sour vegetables we liked so much the other day. She left it on the table for us, set with placemats and bowls, along with freshly cooked rice in the cooker. Riku, to my surprise, ate a good-sized portion of it. I know adults whose entire lunch is a yogurt! I tried very hard to get him settled down for his nap, but he was having none of it... was being so silly and strange... sucking the blanket!, lying on his tummy with his knees pulled up making little eating sounds as though he were a squirrel, with both hands in front of his mouth, and playing with the cord for the lamp behind him... all very unusual things for him to do. He was so close to being asleep three times but never quite made it. </p>
<p>I was very worried he would not be in any mood at all for the dentist.  I did give up finally, as it was soon too late to have him nap anyway. He snuggled in my arms for a bit once we were out of the bedroom. Akane was back from running some errands, and checking out the newly renovated grocery store, and could see that he was a tired boy. I thought some running around time might be good, but Riku wanted to stay home and play with his cars, trucks, and planes.</p>
<p>Akane went out to the bank and Riku did the most interesting thing while we were home for those forty-five minutes. He started listing things, just out of the blue... started with cars, boats, planes, tractors, airplanes, trucks, etc. I joined in and then he switched to kitchen items... forks, bowls, spoons, pots, and so we went, on and on until he switched again... it was fascinating as he really was enjoying it and leading it as well. We took turns saying new words and it was most amazing to see how many words he knows! What fun this was! He ended it all with a list of all the people in his world... Mommy, Daddy, Nana, Grandpa, Auntie Kelly, Brent, Mykayla, Caillie, etc. etc., through the whole family, with me adding all the aunts, Uncle Frank, Tessa, Andrea, and the other cousins and uncles too. All very important to him obviously! </p>
<p> I washed his hair and once again went over what was going to happen at the dentist. I did this several times yesterday and today; I did the same with Kelly and Bryn and it seems to help a lot with new experiences. </p>
<p>The visit went without a hitch! He balked at first at sitting in the big chair, but I sat down on it and pulled him onto my lap to show him it was fine. The dentist and his assistant said I could stay there with him on my lap, and so I did; it worked beautifully, as they put a big bib on him, as I had told him, asked him to open his mouth wide, which he did several times for them with no hesitation at all, let the gal brush his teeth, and then chose "orange!" for his floride treatment. He can't spit yet but did lean over the little sink several times, made a good spitting sound, and said "spit!" </p>
<p>Riku was more than ready for some running-around time (this is why I think he had trouble sleeping... too long in the stroller... a half hour each way, and then not enough time at the store or outside), so his mommy, he, and I headed for the park. First however, Akane stopped to buy a couple of dresses for Misa in the same place I went to the other evening; the fellow who owns it and his mother were there and she was so happy to talk to Akane and tell her how cute Riku is... she had had her son tell me that the other day. And while continuing down the shopping centre towards the park, Riku popped in to see the two very friendly women who make such a fuss over him each time they see him. He went right into the store, to say "good afternoon" in Japanese to them and pulled up his shirt to show them his big tummy too! Akane came up at that point, and since they hadn't met her before, they stood and chatted for a bit while Riku and I waited at the park. He was really itching to get there! </p>
<p>We wandered over to the sandbox/slide area, but nothing much was going on there, so we decided to go to the playground instead. Perfect choice, as there were about eight young children playing there. Riku was happy to sit in the sandbox for the longest time, but eventually got up and joined in some of the running around, playing on the spring toy he likes and peddling in one of the children's little push/peddle cars. Akane went up to put her packages away and came down with my water, sitting there with me for a while. The bugs here are terrible right now! We could see hundreds of them in the light, but worse are the quite small mosquitos, which bite without your noticing them. Now I have about eight sites that can easily drive me mad with scratching! And I know I shouldn't touch them but even the blanket or my sandals touching an area can irritate it.. and so it begins! I am red, swollen, and itchy and would happily complain about this for a few paragraphs! Akane said the bugs here in the summer really are terrible and she kindly commiserated with me. Riku was bitten too, but so far hasn't scratched. </p>
<p>Akane left after a while, not feeling great, and I hung out with Riku as long as there were children there. He was really enjoying himself and I knew he needed the time outdoors. I had offered him a "little snack" at the playground (his container of apricot pieces, blueberries, and cranberries), and he sat up on the bench with us to eat all but a dozen tiny blueberries! This is a hungry boy again... </p>
<p>Home at 6:30; I made him another adult-sized bowl of porridge, with fresh strawberries and very finely chopped almonds in it. He ate every single bite of it... always amazes me! And oh yes, he would like a banana, and oh yes, he would like some ice cream too... sorbet actually. At one point, while this was being discussed, he called out to Akane "<strong>Dessert!</strong>" .. she just wasn't bringing on that ice cream fast enough! He topped all of this off with two vegetable 'cookies', both sesame seed... and juice and water. I look at that belly of his and wonder why it doesn't pop! </p>
<p>Bathtime followed with the usual routine... wash in the sink and play time in the tub. Riku sat on the toilet three times today, all successful. Whew! We're back in business. However, just as I was about to get him out of the tub tonight he made it clear that something was about to happen.. a BM. I quickly wrapped a towel around him and dashed off into the toilet room next door; he seemed quite willing to sit there and try, but nothing happened immediately and he wanted off. Off he got. I told him I would get a diaper so he could have a BM in his diaper. "Okay" he said. However, I wasn't quite fast enough... seconds only! ... but he pointed to a small mound on the hallway floor! "BM there." Yes, indeed. Akane cleaned it up and I put the diaper on him. We didn't tuck him in immediately as we knew he had been interrupted from his task, but after almost a half hour nothing more had happened. </p>
<p>Riku was so obviously tired and more than ready for his bed. He has become used to this bath time and then immediately into bed routine that I think that he expects it now... no side trips to play, no stories, just right into bed. Off they went at 8:20, and at 9:30 Akane carried a boy in here with a dirty diaper. He slept through the change, I carried him back to bed, and left the room immediately. </p>
<p>That's it for me... it's 9:45 p.m. and I am heading to bed. Tomorrow is going to be busy... lunch out with Mrs. Goda and our crew here, to a Japanese restaurant with wonderful vegetable tempura, and then a visit to a Japanese garden following lunch. </p>
<p> I do have lots of emails to answer but no energy tonight and it was a light email day today anyway...</p>
