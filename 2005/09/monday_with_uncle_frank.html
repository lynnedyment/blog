								<h2>Monday with Uncle Frank</h2>
								<p>Shall do a quick review of my day with Uncle Frank in Niagara Falls... we got so much done and there is still lots to do. Lovely that we have fun and get to spend time together while we do it all! </p>
<p>I awoke at 8 a.m., showered, dressed, and puttered around a bit, reading the paper, and sorting out some old black and white negatives. After I finished some of that, and since UF was still sleeping, I decided I would get started on the long row of shirts in the laundry room waiting to be ironed. </p>
<p>The laundry room looked amazing when I walked in last night; UF has spent hours clearing and sorting down there, and then had John paint the floor a warm golden colour. It is shiny and brightens up the space so much; UF also drilled holes in the wall and hung up brooms and mops but mostly he just got rid of so much "clutter". He is really on a roll, and fall cleaning is well underway here. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank slept until 11 a.m.! .. shocked that he had slept so late, but also said he was in a deep and wonderful sleep and felt great. I had just finished the 26 shirts and had put aside two needing buttons, when he came down for his shower. </p>
<p>Brunch at noon... scrambled eggs (as per UF's request), two slices of my "bacon" which he really liked, toasted whole wheat Italian bread (yum!), and stewed tomatoes... and of course our hot cuppa following breakfast. We sat and chatted and went to work sorting through yet another box of photos UF had found on his office shelf. What a treasure this was! Auntie Rita had sorted out many of By's photos and memorabilia, and what a lucky boy he is... cards given to him for his second birthday on up through perhaps nine or so, but many of them for each year. There is one from our Nana Lee, and many from his Auntie Betty and Uncle Stew (my Mom and Dad) as well as other relatives and friends. His baby book is there, so we learned that he spoke his first word, "No!", at ten months, and walked around on his first birthday, and that my Mom found his first tooth at four months of age! We spent hours reading the letters from his grandparents in Colorado, and exclaiming over the wonderful black and white photos of him as a little boy. It was hard to pull ourselves away. </p>
<p>I also stripped UF's bed, and he helped me turn it over end for end and top to bottom. All the bedding got washed, including the dust ruffle, and made up for tonight. </p>
<p>UF phoned, at my gentle prodding, for a doctor's appointment. He is hoping to get in to see a specialist about his hip/leg, and so will see his doctor tomorrow! </p>
<p>UF had sorted more photos for the family while I was in Toronto, and so our goal last night was to deliver them all. I had prepared a wee mid-afternoon snack for us of cheese, a pear, and a date square I had made in Toronto, but by the time we left the house we were both ready for dinner. </p>
<p>Our first drop was at Ian's; he may have been at Lisa's but we dropped the photos between his doors and went for dinner at the Italian restaurant we had eaten at with Shel' and Donna; UF thought the stuffed mushrooms sounded like the perfect dinner, and we shared those and a vegetarian quesadilla. UF declared it a perfect dinner and we shall finish off the quesadilla for lunch today. </p>
<p>We were there much later than we had planned, due to a mistake in the order, so we drove first to Lena Sparkman's, an old friend of Auntie Rita's, with a huge stack of photos of her when she was much much younger, many taken with our mom and AR, and many of her children as well. UF sat in the car for this and the other deliveries, as we had many miles to go tonight. Lena was delighted to see me, and told me I looked just like my Mom! It's not often I hear that and I was very happy to hear it from her. We took a little time for her to see some of the photos and I was so happy that we had decided to keep them for her. </p>
<p>From there we drove right to Beth's with her photos; I called Shel' from there. He and Donna were on their way to bed... 10 p.m. by this time, but we managed to get there and hand them over. UF had found an 8x11 photo of Sheldon singing in a Christmas choir when he was about twelve years old; I think it had been published in the Niagara Falls Review then, and Sheldon was delighted to see it. It's lovely of him; he is wearing a plaid coat and looks oh so sweet and sincere, which he was. </p>
<p>From Shel's we drove to Glenn's; he and Shel' had been on the phone when I walked in, so Glenn and Wendy were expecting us. We did go in there, and spent a lovely hour with them and Steph' too. UF sat in a very comfortable chair which "stood" him up, vibrated in various places (he tried them all!) and with heat. It wasn't easy convincing him it was time to leave! </p>
<p>Wendy has so thoughtfully put together a "memory box" for Jan, filled with photos, memorabilia, as well as her eulogy and death notice, beautifully typed up and in a lovely album. What a gift for Glenn and for Becky, although it may be too soon for them to appreciate it. We always have fun there, and enjoy the company so much. </p>
<p>At 11:30 we said goodnight, with hugs and kisses, and came home for our sleepytime tea, and of course a glass of port each. We went to bed at 12:30, a much more reasonable time than usual around here. What a busy and happy day this was together.</p>
