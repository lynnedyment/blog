								<h2>Wednesday Already!</h2>
								<p>All day today it felt like Tuesday to me; my time here is going all too quickly! I was up and in the shower at 7:15 today, wanting to be ready for the day earlier than I was yesterday. </p>
<p>Bry' and Myk' went off to school at 8:20, as Myk' is responsible for doing the announcements on the PA system this week. I had a quick breakfast with Kelly and then at 9 a.m. she went off with Manitou and Jake, a neighbour's dog, for a two-plus-hour walk with Camila, a weekly tradition. I got busy washing the downstairs bathroom floor and walls, and the kitchen floor. The AC is still on, which is a good thing as it is still hot and humid outside today. A rain storm was promised for later today. </p>
<p>Caillie called from school at 10 a.m. saying she had hurt her arm; I went over to pick her up and called Kelly once we were home. Apparently Caillie was doing this quite a bit last year, deciding on Wednesday that she would rather have more time with her mom than just their lunch hour (it's just the two of them here on Wednesdays), so Kelly was not happy to hear that she was doing this again. Caillie was upstairs in her room while I finished cleaning, and by the time I had the tuna ready for their traditional "tuna melt" lunch, Kelly was home as well. </p>
<p>Gregg joined us for lunch and we decided we wouldn't battle with the wasps today; Caillie doesn't enjoy it one bit. She sat with a list of classmates and friends she wanted to invite to her birthday party, to be held after Bryn's soccer matches on Saturday. We just found out this morning when they were being held, so it's short notice for the party. </p>
<p>We walked her off to school, then I sat and had my tea, continuing on with the last of the mending, and answering the occasional email. Liz called around 3:45 and we had a long chat, while I sat up in the master bedroom. The children were home for snacks, although Kelly and Mykayla went off with Caillie, who was having blue extensions put in her hair as an early birthday present. She isn't allowed, of course!, to colour her hair, as is quite the trend these days, but is thrilled to have the chance to have blue streaks. They look great and I will get some closeup shots of them for the record. </p>
<p>The usual routine of homework, piano, quiet reading time for the children and some fun time on the computer and tossing a ball outside followed. We did get quite a cloudburst though, earlier in the afternoon, and Kelly got wet bringing in the bikes. Gregg got the grass cut just in time for the soaking it needed. </p>
<p>Bryn was to have had soccer practice tonight, and Gregg a meeting over the dinner hour, but both were cancelled. Gregg put together shepherd's pie for dinner; I used some leftovers, and had pasta with fresh tomatoes, grilled zucchini and asparagus, plus pesto and tofu cubes, all tossed together and heated up. It was delicious and really hit the spot. </p>
<p>After dinner, Kelly and Caillie planned Caillie's party; Kelly had called all the parents during the afternoon and all but two of the nine children are able to come with the other two still to be heard from. Caillie was a tired girl today, part of the reason for her wanting to be home with her mom, so off she went to bed at 7 p.m. to read with her. </p>
<p>I'm missing the two little ones, and called them both tonight. Amelia was ready for her bath but happily chatted away at me; how her speaking has changed! She is talking so very well, and so clearly; it was great fun just listening to her and we did lots of back and forth chatting too, about camping, and the stars, and her swimming lesson tomorrow... lots of detail. </p>
<p>Talked with Doug briefly, trying to decide where I needed to start in ordering my prints; he was dashing off to a book reading so I heard briefly that Riku had a cold and a runny nose. Poor sweet baboo. </p>
<p>I spoke with him a little earlier than usual. He was sneezing and sounded stuffy, but we talked and I sang him a few songs. Riku didn't want to sing to me, although Akane told me tonight that they are learning some songs in English at his school, much to our surprise. Riku does them along with the actions and really loves to sing. I could hear him in the background singing away as I spoke with Akane. </p>
<p>I got started on my online photo order and will finish that up tomorrow... Kelly is feeling rotten and has shut down the machine downstairs so I am on my way up to bed... at 10:50 p.m. tonight.</p>
