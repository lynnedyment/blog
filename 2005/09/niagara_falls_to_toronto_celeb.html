								<h2>Niagara Falls to Toronto... Celebrating Kelly's 40th!</h2>
								<p>Well, after a very short night, with less than three hours of sleep, I woke at 8 a.m. and started moving! Sheets in the washer, packed my bags, showered, and sat at 10 a.m. for breakfast with Uncle Frank. We had cereal, toast, fruit, and tea; I checked the bus schedule, found out I had an extra fifteen minutes and so had time to sew on the buttons on two shirts I had hoped to do yesterday. </p>
<p>We left at 10:55 for my 11:15 bus. It was hard to say goodbye to Uncle Frank; we have had such a good time together, and make a good team in the house. He can't believe how much we accomplished and neither could I, and we feel very good about all our hard work. Of course the best parts of our days together are our meals and nighttime glass of port, always relaxing and never rushed. </p>
<p>I thought I would sleep on the bus, but after closing my eyes for a bit, I got busy going through a couple of magazines I took with me and finished off my book as well. Nice to have those finished so that I didn't need to pack them back with me. </p>
<p>Kelly was kind enough to pick me up at 1:10; I was so grateful, as my heel is bothering me and the bags are heavy enough that it would have made it even worse. We went to an outdoor store to pick up Bryn's backpack for the trip and I stocked up on Doug's and my favourite coconut chocolate bars. </p>
<p>Kelly has received some lovely birthday cards; it is so nice that they have come in early as she will not be here on the 2nd of October. Gregg's parents' card was especially touching, commenting on how grateful they are to have Kelly in their son's life and their grandchildren's too. </p>
<p>Gregg went off for a few groceries, and as soon as he returned I started on the cake Kelly had decided on for her birthday... a chocolate chip cheesecake. It's a Mrs. Field's recipe, lighter than our usual one, but with the chocolate chips added to it, looked and sounded great. Of course we hadn't counted on the extra time it needed to stay in the oven after it baked, and Gregg had chicken to go in. As a result, dinner wasn't on the table until 7:30, later for the children than was ideal.</p>
<p>Dinner was delicious though, and well worth waiting for. Gregg had breaded and baked chicken with parmesan cheese in the crumbs, added Kelly's tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese to it, and baked it again until it was heated through and the cheese melted. We had some leftover tofu in the fridge to use up, and he used the same technique with it; it was just wonderful. Bryn loved it too, as did Bry'. Yum! I plan to make this at home. Along with it, we had a Caesar salad and gnocchi. </p>
<p>Kelly opened her presents immediately after dinner; we took the usual photos as the cake was brought in and the candles blown out with wishes. Of course Kelly's gift for this special birthday is their upcoming trip to the Grand Canyon, but Gregg and the children had bought her some lottery tickets to try her luck with. Myk's gave her $11 in total which pleased both of them very much. </p>
<p>Doug and I gave her all her wrapped gifts... two pairs of black "West Van" leisure pants, which looked just amazing on her, as I knew they would, a very pretty pink long sleeved top, which looks great with the pants, two children's books ("James and the Giant Peach", and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"), which she wanted for her collection of children's books, a large bottle of "Rescue Remedy" for those nights that she can't get to sleep, a tube of her favourite tanning lotion, a bottle of ice wine to share with Gregg on a night alone with him, and a purple travel kit, a larger one which more suits her needs these days; she and Gregg often share one. </p>
<p>Mark joined us for dinner as well. He gave Kelly $40 worth of gift certificates for Le Commensal, a place we both love to go to. I didn't even get there this trip, or to Marche, another favourite. Life has been far too busy this fall! </p>
<p>We didn't have the cake after all; it was too soft to get out of the pan in one piece, and so they had other treats... coconut cloud cake, and chocolate. Tomorrow at lunch we will have it, and we will put the full 40 candles on it as well. </p>
<p>After the children were tucked it, we realized how tired we all were, and after I wrote a couple of emails, and watched a bit of TV with Kelly and Gregg, we headed up to bed. I didn't read one page in my new book before turning off the light at 11:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Missing Uncle Frank and my glass of port, although we did have some lovely white wine with dinner. I had a lovely email from Uncle Frank, though, filling me in on all of his accomplishments today; he made a stop at the Legion with the scrapbook of photos we found the day before, and the kind people at the Goodwill store unloaded all the items from the back of his car. He also planted the pot of orange mums, which he hopes will last through the winter, did a little weeding, pulled up and cooked rhubarb from the side yard, and even cooked himself a tasty omelette using the green pepper and mushrooms in the fridge. What a guy!</p>
