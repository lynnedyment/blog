								<h2>My Last Day in Toronto...</h2>
								<p>... and it is such a fall day! We woke up to the trees blowing madly, and with a definite nip in the air. Brrr! The children had to wear long pants and long sleeves for the first day, although the sun came up later and warmed them all up, but not the adults. </p>
<p>Kelly went off for her run, after delivering Caillie to school a half hour late. Caillie had "clothing issues" again today, just not able to find the clothes that fit comfortably, and that she was happy with; Kelly is using some Super Nanny techniques and they seem to work very well with Caillie... not that we are surprised at this. When Caillie is tired she has a very low meltdown point, and today was one of those days. Caillie is a child who is in bed at 7 p.m. and almost always asleep at 7:30; even one night of not getting twelve hours of sleep takes a toll on her. The other children stay up an hour later, but they too need early-to-bed routines. </p>
<p>I sat and had a big mug of hot chocolate, such a treat on a colder than usual morning. And then I started cleaning the kitchen; I don't usually go to bed leaving dishes undone, but there were just too many of them to fit in the dishwasher last night and I didn't have the energy to deal with the rest of them. Gregg cooks, for which we two Dyment women are very grateful, and I am more than happy to take responsibility for the aftermath. It was a good day for this, though; I took everything off the counters, washed them all thoroughly once the dishes were done, wiped the cupboard doors, and swept through the dining room.</p>
<p>I had time to read my emails, answer a few quick ones from Uncle Frank, and then it was time to get lunch ready. Mark had kindly picked up another roti for me, and I had half for my lunch, while the others had mac' and cheese. All four children were home today. Of course we had the cheesecake, now just perfectly chilled and very very tasty! I had walked out for the candles, Kelly got to make another wish, and it was a fun last lunch with all of the children. Myk' and Bry' are with their mom for dinner tonight. </p>
<p>I spent the best part of the afternoon packing my two bags, plus a very full carry-on and another "purse". I may have to leave a few things behind, as I have so many books for the children to take home, some puzzles, food, cheese, fruit bars, clothes for Amelia from Kelly, etc. etc. that it was a real challenge. I just hope that neither of the check-in bags weighs more than 70 pounds! There are no scales here to check this with and I may have to do some switching around at the airport. I'm not looking forward to my four-hour wait in Chicago with a too-heavy carry on. </p>
<p>At 4 o'clock Kelly drove me to the school to watch Myk's soccer game. Bryn had come home an hour early today, as he hadn't felt well, and Bryant and Caillie were there to see the game as well. It was bloody cold standing around the field, even with the blanket I had taken along with me to sit on, wrapped around me instead! Gregg joined me for the second half of the game, Caillie and Bryant kept warm on their scooters, and Myk' was fine too, running up and down the field during the first half of the game. They lost 5-0 and home we came. </p>
<p>Our plan had been to have dinner out at a Japanese restaurant Bryn and Caillie are very fond of; Bryn so wants me to try his favourite egg dish there, and a tofu entree as well, but of course since he left school early, Kelly decided not to set a precedent where a child could miss school and then carry on as usual. It was too bad, but understandable; we will have our dinner out at Christmas instead, and tonight we can use up all our leftovers. </p>
<p>Dinner was delicious; I had the gnochhi with a mushroom, a whole tomato, some shredded "chicken" and a little spinach added to it, along with toasted baguette. The children had some toast too, after they finished their chicken, salad and corn dinner. Meant to have a slice of cheesecake too, but I forgot about it! </p>
<p>I watched the newest CM training video whilst doing three more pieces of mending, and running up and down doing the laundry. At 9 p.m. Kelly and I pulled out the winter clothing buckets, prepared for the big switch-over, but ran out of time. She and Gregg wanted to watch the first season show of one of their favourite tv series, and so we ended up putting them back again, after sorting out some of Bryn's clothes. Kelly will have the whole Thanksgiving weekend for this job, although she would rather have company while doing it. Ah well... she needed to sit down and take a break at 10 p.m. </p>
<p>I wrote to Uncle Frank, who had written a lovely email to me, answered a couple of others, and did one final run downstairs at 11 p.m. </p>
<p>I've been in bed, but have a few things on my mind that I am afraid I will forget, and no doubt there is some excitement too at the prospect of being home and seeing everyone again. I spoke to Riku tonight and he was still hacking quite badly. Bryn took him to the doctor today, and he was diagnosed with a "small pocket of pneumonia"! Apparently there were three other cases this week at this practice, and tomorrow he will likely be on antibiotics, after the xray results are back. No singing for him tonight; he was watching TV with his dad and no doubt still not feeling his usual self. </p>
<p>Back to bed I go... tomorrow I shall be writing from San Francisco; hard to imagine not being here.</p>
