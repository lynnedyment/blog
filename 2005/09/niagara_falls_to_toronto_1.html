								<h2>Niagara Falls to Toronto</h2>
								<p>Woke at 8 a.m. this morning, and even though I had not had nearly enough sleep decided to get up and start packing my bags. I was taking back far more than I came with, after buying a few things at the dollar stores, and relieving UF of some of his "clutter". </p>
<p>The two and a half hours passed quickly; the packing was out of the way soon enough, I showered and dressed, had time for a couple of quick emails, read Bryn's three latest blogs on days with Riku, got breakfast ready on the table, and still had time to sort through a drawer and some photos before sitting down with Uncle Frank. I also called and left a message for Beth saying goodbye. We only got to play cards once while I was home! </p>
<p>The bus left at 11:15 and I said a sad goodbye to Uncle Frank; I shall miss him, as our days passed quickly, getting so much accomplised, and yet we had lots of relaxed hours together as well. I may be back on Monday/Tuesday though... haven't quite decided. Bryn and Caillie will be at their Dad's and my friends may not be available here. </p>
<p>Kelly, with a bright CM t-shirt, which looks great on her, greeted me with a big smile and her hair cut shorter, about shoulder length and she looks terrific. Whatever was causing her to feel ill for weeks now has finally gone and she is feeling energetic and ready to get busy with her life again. She had to run an errand, we picked up a couple of tofu hot dogs, and picked up groceries on the way home. Those out of the way, a quick email check and it was time to walk to school to pick up the children. </p>
<p>It has been another gorgeous day here; I wish I had taken my camera with me, as the children all wore red today for their assembly, and looked such a bright group walking along with Manitou leading the way. I must do this another day. A photo op' for sure! </p>
<p>Myk' had a soccer game at 6 p.m., so it was a rush to get all four children's piano practice done, the dog walked, snack time served and eaten, and quiet reading time in as well, but we dashed out the door and drove to the soccer field. Caillie, Bryn, and Bryant had taken along skateboards and scooters and I went over and took far too many photos of them trying to catch them in mid-air, but with no luck at all. Caillie even faked a little jump for me, but I didn't catch that either. Myk's team meanwhile had scored two goals and the game ended with a tie. </p>
<p>Kelly and Gregg are off to a wedding in Oshawa tonight, so dinner was bought pizza rather than their usual Friday night homecrafted-pizza-by-Gregg night. Too bad; it is always so good, but perhaps there will be another opportunity before I leave Toronto. The children all ate five pieces of pizza each! I ate Caillie's crusts and a nice big serving of a most delicious fresh homegrown chopped tomatoes, two varieties, feta cheese, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar dressed salad, with home-grown basil as well. I love this and plan to eat lots of tomatoes while I am here. Kelly also has fresh tomato sauce made up in the fridge and a container of her homemade pesto too. I love fall in Ontario! </p>
<p>Uncle Frank had given me a movie, so after Kelly and Gregg left, we all sat down to watch it. I fell asleep during parts of it! I wasn't surprised, as I have had some very late nights and didn't get nearly enough sleep last night. The children were tucked in at 9:30; I tidied up the kitchen, wrote a couple of emails, tried to annotate some photos, but couldn't figure out how to access them to do so. Too tired anyway so it's just as well. It just seemed very odd to be thinking of going to bed at 10:15! It's now forty-five minutes later and I am ready to crawl into bed with Caillie and read... and sleep.</p>
