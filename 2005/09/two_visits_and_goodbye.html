								<h2>Two Visits and Goodbye...</h2>
								<p>Awoke at 8 a.m. today and had a head start on my day... lots to do, so I answered a few emails, wrote a couple of blogs, did some laundry, sorted a few envelopes of photographs, ironed all my blouses and a couple of pairs of slacks, and tidied up a bit in the laundry room. By the time I had showered Uncle Frank was also ready for breakfast... eggs and toast for a treat today, with our half whole wheat Italian bread, toasted. Delicious! </p>
<p>Busy day again today, with lunch planned with Amelia/Amy, a haircut later on, and the evening with Ian. Uncle Frank decided to drive me out to Garner Road to Amy's so that he would have the car to run a few errands on his own. It was a lovely drive out there, and we were a little late arriving since we ran into some road work and had to detour. </p>
<p>Amelia looks great; we relaxed with a glass of white wine before having our lunch, cooked by Jake last night, as he is working the chip wagon today. He made the most delicious potato pancakes for us, tender and very tasty; we each had four of them(!) and ate a green salad while they were heating up. We chatted in their bright cozy rec' room, catching up on news of our children, grandchildren, and our plans for the next year or so. It was really lovely to have almost five hours together, as too often one of us has other plans and we are left with so much unsaid. Not today though, although we never run out of things to talk about! </p>
<p>UF was late picking me up as he ran into even more road work, but I had called to say I would be late for my appointment. I walked in at 4:30 and out at 5 p.m. UF picked me up and we dashed off to the cemetery first; we had been meaning to get there all week and I didn't want to leave without going there with UF. First we went to Mom's and Dad's which was covered in weeds. Mom would not have been happy! We had a little joke about her complaining as I pulled up the weeds. It took a while but I got every single last one, and then in the way I saw the Japanese do, got a nice big pail of water and poured it over the entire stone, front and back, which got all the dust off and made it gleam in the sunshine. UF suggested that I put down some plastic and then cover it with pink or white stones so I shall do that the next time I am there. </p>
<p>We went over to Auntie Rita's stone next, which is well-weeded and tended to, with large pots of mums in full bloom and a couple of artificial arrangements as well. I took photos of both, as I always do. </p>
<p>From there we scooted over to the bin store, where I bought almonds and cashews for Ian, and UF stocked up on some mixed nuts for himself. It was much later than we hoped by this time, and we still had to have dinner before going to Ian's. I put together a very quick corn and feta cheese omelette, using the cob from Amelia's garden, and added a side salad of greens and a lovely tomato from Amelia as well. I topped this with the cucumber dressing they gave us to sample from the deli and we both agreed it was delicious. </p>
<p>Ian was waiting for us when we pulled up at his house at 7:30; we went up to visit with him there. I gave him the book Doug had ordered for him, the nuts I just bought, and a big bag of fresh California pistachios (I intend to help him keep his weight up to 150 pounds; he looks great!), and UF had a couple of WW2 books for him too. We sat and chatted, Ian made tea and put out cookies as always, and the next couple of hours passed quickly. Ian is working six days a week, and has been busy with Lisa and her sister and friend, both of whom are visiting from England. About 9:30 we headed over there, meeting both these women, and enjoying our time in Lisa's home, our first visit there. She is so good for our brother, and of course I took lots of photos of everyone. </p>
<p>We said goodnight at 11 p.m. Ian has to be up early for work and UF and I still had groceries to buy! We stopped at the A&P near his house and did our shopping in the very quiet store. Susan had asked me to pick up some fruit and veggie bars for Amelia, and a clerk went out of her way to help us find those and the English custard UF needs for his rhubarb desserts this winter. </p>
<p>Of course we were both tired when we got home at almost midnight, and intended going to bed early, but as usual, had our glass of port, sat at the table sorting photos, and there went another two hours! Yikes! Bed at 2:15 this night... too late, but I wouldn't have changed a bit of it. </p>
<p>I'm off to Toronto in the morning at 11 a.m.</p>
