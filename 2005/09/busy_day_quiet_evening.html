								<h2>Busy Day, Quiet Evening...</h2>
								<p>Caillie and I were wakened by Kelly at 8:30 this morning, both snuggled in together with the fan blowing on us. Myk's soccer game was at 10 a.m., so we all had breakfast, took our water bottles with us, and off we went. Bryant, Bryn, and Caillie took along their skateboards and/or scooters and I watched them do their stuff for a while and then sat and watched Myk's game. The score was 5-0 for the other team. We came right home with lots to do; Kelly and Gregg dashed out for an hour plus to pick up birthday gifts, the children all did their piano practice, played with Manitou, did some homework, and read, as well as perused the huge neighbourhood garage sale. I made grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch (I had a generous bowl of the tomato salad Kelly had made for me last night, along with some crusty seeded bread to dip in the juices) in the midst of their busy three hours, and we were all ready to leave for game number two when Kelly and Gregg arrived home at 3:35. </p>
<p>It was a little cooler this afternoon, although the sun was still shining. Bryn took along the huge frisbee he bought for fifty cents, and he, Bry', Caillie, and I tossed it around for a while. Myk's team lost 3-2, which meant it was the end of the team's participation in the playoffs. </p>
<p>At the end of the game the children and I were standing waiting for Kelly to finish chatting with a friend. There was a young eight year old boy on his skateboard nearby doing some tricks with his board; I asked him how old he was and whether he had taken lessons. He hadn't, but said he loved trying new things and practiced a lot; he showed me how he could jump on his board, turn it over and land on it as it flipped over. Bry' watched with interest, tried it out, and then tried again and again, until he too could almost do it. By the time we left he could also do this, almost every time! I was very impressed. Bry' had a couple of lessons for his birthday and his teacher thought he had a natural ability there; it was obvious that this is true. </p>
<p>Back at home, we all had various things to do... Bryn played with Manitou, Caillie made a card for Mary Ellen, Myk' made a card for Emma, and she and Bry' packed up their suits for the swimming party tonight. Bry' and I also looked at some of the photos from spring break in California before they all left together at 4 p.m.</p>
<p>A very exciting things happened today... the first was seeing Mykayla play the piano backwards! She was sitting near the table facing it, and just for the heck of it, put her hands behind her and started playing a tune, one of her songs from her lessons. She was just amazing! It obviously required more than a bit of concentration; she played it a few times, and each time I was just astounded! Can't wait to show Kelly and Gregg tomorrow. </p>
<p>I was on my own for the evening and had plenty to do... started the wash, unpacked the two bags from the Falls, sorted out the gifts from here from the gifts to go back to SF, put away my pressed clothes, and sorted the clothes that need ironing for the following week. I also answered a few emails from Gail, made myself a delicious dinner of mushrooms, "chicken", and spinach, eating it sitting on the sofa reading. I did three loads of laundry and then took Manitou for a forty-minute walk at 7:30. All was in order, the kitchen tidied, and I was ready to sit down, just as Gail called for a nice long chat. </p>
<p>Gregg, Kelly, Myk', and Bry' arrived home at 10:30, tired after a busy but fun day. I won't be up late tonight and am so pleased that I got all the things done I intended to do.</p>
