								<h2>Monday in Toronto</h2>
								<p>I awoke too early today, at 6:20 a.m., so turned on the light, read for ten minutes and drifted back into a deep sleep for an hour and a half extra. Lovely! </p>
<p>Kelly drove Gregg off to the car rental at 8 a.m., and I dashed around getting ready to meet Vicki. Manitou needed a quick trip down the alleyway before going off with a friend of Kelly's and her dog, for a long run with them both. I did some ironing, folded a load of clothes, and quickly ate some cold cereal before leaving the house at 10 a.m. Subway to Eglinton, to Indigo where I was to meet Vicki, and where I picked up a couple of birthday/Christmas gifts for the SF children. </p>
<p>Vicki and I walked over to her daughter Cathy's house on this perfectly wonderful fall day. Cath' and Mike live across from a big park and as we approached we could see Cath' and six-month old Will' on a blanket on the lawn. What a beautiful smiley boy he is! I held him after getting lots of smiles from him, with a wide smile and teeth just bursting to emerge. Cath' is lovely, and exactly the mom I knew she would be... big smiles for her little guy every time she looked at him, or he at her. He loves his "Grandy" too, although Cath' was kind enough to say he obviously loves grandmas as he gave us lots of attention and wasn't the least bit shy with me. We visited for a good hour plus, and of course I took lots of photos! Can't wait to see them! </p>
<p>Vicki treated me to a wonderful Italian lunch... a glass of Niagara-on-the-Lake wine, light and delicious, a wrap with egg, asparagus, tomatoes and cheese, with a perfect mixed green salad. Good bread. Great company with lots of time for catching up, and followed by a shared pane cotta with berries and tea. Vicki has put aside her doula work since William arrived; like me, Vicki is not sure how long this little one will live within such close proximity and isn't willing to give up any of it. I know exactly how she feels. </p>
<p>We did a little shopping together, stopping at a health food store and then at a drug store for only-in-Canada supplies for me. I caught the subway home in time to meet Kelly at the school, where she was meeting Myk' and Bry'. Hans Feldmann Sr. was there too, to meet Caillie. It was so nice to see him; he looks great and they have plans to go to Listowel tomorrow with the children and Hans, for a tractor event, I believe. No doubt Mark will be going with them. I didn't see Bryn as he was at a school soccer game at 3:30. </p>
<p>I asked Bry' to come upstairs with me, and when I showed him his room I got a very enthusiastic "Thank you very much!" Bry' really appreciates a clean and tidy room, but especially appreciates someone else helping with it. He has been like this from the time I have known him and his enthusiasm is very sweet. He immediately asked if we could sort out the bins I told him needed doing, and we did so while Kelly prepared their fruit snack. We got through two bins, with lots getting tossed, and most being sorted, and then after his snack he came up again and we went through the other four. It looks great, we had a huge bag of things to get rid of, and now we need Bryn to go through his belongings. Bryn tends to keep more than Bry' does, but I'm sure there will be some things he hasn't used in the past six months and will be willing to toss. </p>
<p>Kelly walked the two children over to their piano lesson at 5 p.m., came home, and we put out the garbage plus a few things from the basement clear-out... a children's wooden school desk, which disappeared within the hour, an old golf bag, and a printer/scanner. Yahoo! We also have a nice stack of things to go to the school for their big sale, so slowly but surely the house is getting decluttered. </p>
<p>We ate some leftover pizza for dinner (things sure are different when Gregg is around!), watched Dr. Phil, and the first day of the 20th season of Oprah. I was ready to just put my feet up, and enjoyed both shows, but then dashed down to do another couple of loads of laundry. How it piles up around this house with four active children! </p>
<p>I phoned Riku a little earlier tonight, hoping to catch him before his tubtime. Instead, he was eating dinner... spinach ravioli. He sounded much better tonight; he told me he played with blocks and trains at school. We had quite a little songfest session, starting with me singing the alphabet to him (he asked for it by name!), and then we went on to some familiar nursery rhymes... Jack and Jill (he told me that Jack did not climb up the hill!... and then giggled when I insisted he had), Humpty Dumpty, Little Miss Muffet.. and another set of giggles when I said he frightened Miss Muffet away. We sang "Down at the Station" together, with Riku doing Grandpa's "all aboard!" at the end, and then I suggested we hang up so he could finish his dinner. He said "nice talking to you" and we finished off with our usual "goodnight sweetheart" and "talk to you soon." </p>
<p>I wanted to talk with Amelia and hoped I wasn't calling too late for her at 7:15 their time. I was lucky, as her day was running later than usual, and she and Kevin were still at the playground. It gave me a chance to talk with Susan and catch up with her a bit. Amelia came in but didn't feel like talking; she was ready for some TV time, despite it really being her dinner and bath time. Her mom held steady and I could hear Amelia in the background chatting away about her shoes. I asked her where her shoes were when she came to the phone and she said "right here"! She did say goodnight to me, kissed the phone, and went off being her busy self. Can't wait to see her again and then went right to the darling photos Doug took of her on her napping on Friday on their walk together.  </p>
<p>Kelly had a three-and-a-half-hour new consultant orientation meeting here, and is just now finishing up. I'm going to join her, fold the next load of laundry, and relax with her. It's 10:30 already, and I'm sure Kelly will want to get to sleep at a decent hour tonight. Tomorrow we plan to do a major sorting/cleaning in her CM room downstairs. Night night...</p>
