								<h2>"I Love My Life" ... BDF</h2>
								<p>Cool morning, hot humid afternoon, and a lovely cool evening; welcome to fall in Ontario. I arose early this morning, at 6:30, and came downstairs to answer emails before the household awakened. Myk' came down first, at 7:15, all dressed and ready to head to school early for her morning announcement duties. Bry' followed, then Brynnie, and they all went off to school early, walking with Gregg and Manitou. </p>
<p>Caillie had a tough morning, not happy with what her clothes choices were. Kelly had to use all of her patience to get her down here for breakfast and a quick walk to school. The rest of her day was much better! </p>
<p>I played ball with Manitou in the alley this morning, as Kelly had a meeting in the neighbourhood. It's amazing how often he manages to catch it, despite my erratic throwing. </p>
<p>Only Caillie and Bryn were home for lunch today; Myk' and Bry' both had lunchtime activities at school. Kelly made mac' 'n cheese and I put spinach and mushrooms in mine, as well as a whole tomato from the garden. It was so good! </p>
<p>The afternoon flew by; I cleaned out the silverware drawer, started cleaning the outside of the kitchen cabinets, and spent too much time on my photo-ordering project. I had some questions, and after some time was given a credit for three months down the road; this is perfect as ordering them will be much easier from home, with access to dates, etc. Whew! </p>
<p>Bryn had soccer after school, and Myk' and Bry' were to go to their mom's early, so Kelly, Caillie, and I went off on a quick shoe-buying trip for Caillie. We were successful, and Kelly found shoes for Myk' too; we picked up a couple of extra items at Zeller's and bought a few groceries while we were out. After dropping Caillie at her piano lesson, we again dashed home, then took Bryn to his lesson, picking up Caillie! ... what a dash today. Home again, picked Bryn up... and on the way out to the car Bryn told Kelly, "I love my life!". What a lovely statement to hear from him! </p>
<p>We came home to a delicious pesto pasta dinner prepared by Gregg. We ate outside &mdash; it was perfect tonight with no wasps &mdash; and then Gregg took Bryn off to his second practice of the day, taking Manitou with him too. </p>
<p>Caillie's birthday is on Saturday, so tomorrow is the day for her to take cupcakes in to her class. Caillie, being Caillie, has decided she also wants to give one to each of her former teachers too, so as soon as dinner was over she and I got busy in the kitchen. We made the batter together for Susan Mendelson's wonderful chocolate cake recipe, and then wrapped 48 pennies in foil. Caillie also decided it would be very nice if everyone got a treat in the cupcakes, even those who are not invited to her party. She measured and scooped, beat and stirred, broke the eggs, added the milk, etc. until we had a nice big bowl of yummy smelling chocolate batter. </p>
<p>I scooped in a half measure of the batter, Caillie placed a foil wrapped coin in the middle, and she filled the cups to the top. Off she went to bed at 7:15, a tired but happy girl. Instead of a bedtime story tonight, she and her mommy discussed the "Survivor" games she will have at her party on Saturday. </p>
<p>Bryn came in hot and sweaty from his practice, had one of the warm cupcakes, and headed up to shower. He came downstairs, helped me wrap the rest of the coins, placed them in the cups for me, and licked the beaters. I know he was hoping the bowl would be empty before he went to bed, but I still had three more pans to cook... twelve at a time, times four! Kelly had two and agreed that they were delicious; I think we are down to 42 now. I will ice them tomorrow morning for delivery to the class after lunch. </p>
<p>It took a while to clean up the kitchen; I did two more loads of laundry, and was happy to sit down with Kelly and watch TV for an hour, chatting during commercials. Gregg had gone off to meet a fellow who is going to dogsit Manitou when they are away in October, and came home bearing a two-man tent, very small, and a great backpack to borrow. Two items down, two to go! </p>
<p>I called Riku at 7:30 his time; I had Kelly talk to him and she immediately sang two songs along with him, listened to him sing "Itsy Bitsy Spider" and "Down at the Station" as well as "ABC"... they chatted quite a while and then I had a few minutes with him before he had to go to bed. "Bye sweetheart" and "I love you" are sweet words to hear before bedtime. He did say he was still sick; I hope his cold is over soon. </p>
<p>Off to bed at 11 p.m.</p>
