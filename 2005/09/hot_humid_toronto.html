								<h2>Hot Humid Toronto!</h2>
								<p>We had the AC running today and all night too; I just heard on the news that the humidex today made it seem like it was 39C even though it was <em>only</em> 29. Tomorrow will be even hotter and then a cold front is expected; I wouldn't mind it being a tad cooler but a "cold front" sounds ominous. </p>
<p>I spent the whole of today in the house except for one walk to school with Kelly at 3:30 to meet Myk' and Bryant. I was glad to get back inside. </p>
<p>So, here was my day... woke at 8:45! to find that Bry' and Myk' were already at school, and Kelly and Gregg were snuggled in bed as well. Gregg had crawled in with Kelly after getting the children off to school, and the phone woke them at 9:05. What a lazy morning it was for us around here. Emails, a chat with Doug on Skype, and washing the bathroom floor and walls finished up my morning. We had lunch together in the living room (I had tomato salad and the end of the beet salad... so good, both of them), chatting, and then Kelly dashed off for a CM meeting while I turned on the TV and did some mending. Kelly had a nice big stack waiting for me and it was great to sit, have my tea, watch Oprah, and then a "Home with Baby" show, which I enjoyed as well. </p>
<p>Off to pick up the children, and down to help Kelly clean and straighten up the CM room, as there was a crop going on down there tonight. We did a great job and Kelly got so much done; she sorted out and threw lots out while I organized the pop, candy, and extra supply shelf. We worked hard while the children did their piano practice and read for a half hour each. </p>
<p>Gregg made dinner, which we stopped for at 6:45... hamburgers (I had spicy "beef" with mushrooms and spinach), corn on the cob, and grilled zucchini and asparagus. We ate outside; the air was beginning to cool off, so it was very pleasant. </p>
<p>Kelly and I went back down to do a little more organizing before the three gals came in at 7:30 for the crop. Kelly dealt with the various piles of things needing to be organized, while I checked emails and finished up a blog. At 9 p.m. I went downstairs and sorted out the photos from Kelly, Bryn, and Caillie's visit to San Francisco in March of 2003. It was such fun seeing Bryn, Caillie, and Riku from two years ago! We started a second Power Sort box since Kelly still has a huge box of photos from Gregg to organize. </p>
<p>The last two gals left at 10:45, Kelly and I put everything away, and now it's time to head upstairs... at 11:40 p.m.</p>
