								<h2>A Long Walk and Early to Bed</h2>
								<p>Had a lovely long sleep-in today. Today is the practice day for the Dyment/Feldmann/Tilston crew's hike in the Grand Canyon, three weeks from now. Kelly dashed off at 10 a.m. to pick up Bryn and Caillie from their sleepovers; Gregg had made sandwiches, I boiled eggs, we filled water bottles (two each), took along carrots and celery, packed it all into backpacks, and headed off down the Danforth, on our way to Bloor Street. Manitou joined us too.</p>
<p>Kelly and Gregg were not sure how long it would take us to walk 6 miles, as the children haven't walked that far in a single stretch. we were walking along busy streets, and it was hot; Caillie had problems with her shoes, which don't fit closely to her foot, and with her backpack as well. She needed lots of stops and the rest of us stopped for bathroom breaks, to fetch a sandwich, a drink, and near the end we shared popsicles too. I'm sure they would be a hit if available on the way up from the Canyon! We traded walking partners along the way, and had a very successful walk indeed. We called a halt at the five and a half mile mark (9km); we had walked for three hours, not a bad first run for the crew. </p>
<p>Mykayla had to be at the sports field for her soccer tournament trophy event, and so we caught the subway home and took the van to the field. It was hot and we were happy to find shade to stand in while the trophies were being handed out. Myk' sat happily with her teammates eating pizza and drinking pop, before we headed back home. </p>
<p>Home for homework, piano practice, quiet reading time, and dinner. Gregg did a barbecue with ribs, grilled zucchini and asparagus, and boiled corn. I made up a dish with spinach and "chicken" and thoroughly enjoyed our dinner outdoors. Showers followed for all of the children, and it was an early night for them all. What a busy and fun, eventful weekend we had!  </p>
<p>I had been thinking of the camping trip that Susan, Kevin, Amelia, Riku, Bryn, Brent, Miya, Ivonne, Troy, and Diego had been on, and hoping to see lots of photos. Before going to bed I called Riku and heard a little bit about sleeping in tents, and a big fire, and lots of giggles from my little guy too! Bryn even managed to get his unedited photos out to me, which was so kind of him. They were wonderful and it looked as though everyone had a great time. </p>
<p>Night night...</p>
