								<h2>One Week More in Ontario!</h2>
								<p>... and how this five weeks has flown by! I can hardly believe that I will be back in San Francisco a week from now; there is still so much to do here, and I haven't visited with everyone I would like to... and perhaps won't, at this late date. I am off to the Falls on Sunday, returning here on Wednesday morning, and two days later I will be on the plane west. </p>
<p>Caillie and I sleep well together; she snuggles up and curls up against me, just as the night gets cooler, making it ever so easy to slip back into sleep when I awaken around 6:30 a.m. Today however, Caillie woke a little earlier than usual, around 7:10, and we talked softly, about the sound machine I brought for her from home, while I rubbed her back and spent that quiet time together. This is a busy household and our time alone together is limited. </p>
<p>This morning she was up and dressed in her new navy blue skirt, blue tights, neat black buckled shoes (no runners today!) and a cute striped top. I couldn't resist getting a photo of her outside, waiting for her Mom to walk her to school. This is rare too, as mornings are harder for Caillie than the other children, and there is always a last-minute change of socks, or slacks, or top, causing a dash out the door. </p>
<p>Bryn, Bry' and Myk' all went off together earlier, so Gregg and Kelly, with Manitou, walked Caillie to school and came home with a Starbucks hot chocolate for me... a lovely treat. At home I have a big mug of hot chocolate every day but here have had it only twice in four weeks. </p>
<p>Once again, our plan was to get to work on more fall cleaning/sorting, but Kelly had a photo to work on and order, a business call, and some computer business to do first. I washed the second windown in the living room, and two blinds, answered a couple of emails and chatted with Glenna, who called late in the morning. She is on her way to South America tomorrow for a week and then Bermuda, but has just had her baby granddaughter and daughter-in-law visiting with them for a week. Jasmine looks just like her dad (Sharif) at the same age. Can't wait to get to Montreal for a visit to Glenna's new home on Nun's Island; she moved in a year ago! One day... </p>
<p>All the children took their lunches to school today; I had leftover butternut squash risotto, which I missed out on last night (it's one of Kelly's specialties and Caillie, Myk' and Bry' are very fond of it too), and Gregg made grilled ham and cheese for Kelly and himself. </p>
<p>Finally, at almost 2 p.m. we got upstairs to the third floor landing sorting... books, books, and more books, and some games. Kelly gathered together two large stacks of books for the school library/classrooms, and a bushel basket filled with games and assorted oddments, while I tidied and cleared out most of Caillie's room. </p>
<p>Kelly and I drove the goodies to school, gave Bry' his sleeping bag and pillow for his sleepover at a friend's house, went to Rogers video store for movies for Caillie and Myk' tonight, one for the adults which we will watch at some point this weekend, and dropped off Caillie at the hairdresser's to get two bright red strands of red "hair" added to the four blue streaks already there. They are not permanent colouring of her own hair, but woven into her lovely blond hair. Myk' went with her and they walked home together soon after that was done. </p>
<p>I had needed Kelly's help with some of the sorting in Caillie's room,  but unfortunately did not get the garbage bag tossed out before she came home. Caillie was quite upset that Kelly was actually throwing out two broken tambourines!, and the odd bits of paper and plastic bits and feathers that I had gathered up. Egad! The child is a hoarder for sure; it is so difficult for her to get rid of anything at all. We should know better; even books she hasn't read in years become immediately important to her. </p>
<p>It's Friday night, and two of the four children were going to be home tonight, but Gregg had decided not to make his homemade pizza for dinner. I was so disappointed, as I haven't been here for it yet this trip. Apparently Kelly told him this, and the next thing I knew they were out the door to buy pizza dough and portobello mushrooms. How wonderful! I did a little more clearing out in Caillie's room, sat down to answer a couple of emails upstairs, but was soon drawn down to the delicious smell of the pizza cooking. Mine was superb... roasted red pepper, mushrooms, and eggplant, fresh basil and other herbs from the garden, Kelly's homemade tomato sauce, spinach, broccoli, and feta cheese. Oh my, it was soooo good, and I ended up eating what should have been enough for two meals in all for me. He made the girls plain cheese, and he and Kelly added chicken to theirs. We all watched some of "Mean Girls" with the two girls and at 9 p.m. they went up for a sleepover in Myk's bedroom. I shall have Caillie's room to myself tonight. </p>
<p>I phoned Riku at 7:30 his time, and he has such a cold; he sounded so stuffy and had no energy but was happy to have his Auntie Kelly sing "Baby Beluga" to him, and I sang a little to him as well. Poor wee tyke; it was hard to listen to his stuffy little nose and low voice. Doug picked him up from school today and I hope he had a nice long nap in the car before they went on their exploration walk in Golden Gate Park; the photos he sent were lovely, if not his usual smiley self. </p>
<p>I'm off to bed; it's midnight and tomorrow we are going to celebrate Bryn's birthday, three days early. That means a coconut cloud cake is in the works for tomorrow...</p>
