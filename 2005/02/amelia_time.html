								<h2>Amelia Time</h2>
								<p>Today was another gorgeous sunny and warm day here. After chatting with my sisters and brother in the early morning, I dashed off to walk with Amelia in Golden Gate Park; it was time for her mom's annual physical. </p>
<p>Susan was walking her in the Panhandle when I arrived at 9:45. Amelia had dozed off waiting for me... it's always difficult to find parking in that neighbourhood on Wednesdays as it is street cleaning day. However, she opened her eyes long enough to give me a sleepy smile, and five minutes later she was fast asleep again. </p>
<p>I walked slowly, enjoying the sunshine, and did my usual stroll... through the rose garden, with all the pruned bushes waiting to bloom, to Stow Lake, walking around twice, enjoying the birds and stopping to take a couple of photos of the cherry blossoms and the California poppies. </p>
<p>After an hour and fifteen minutes a woman speaking very loudly walked by, waking Amelia. She kept her head down though and I started to sing "Rock-a-Bye Baby" to her, at which point she held her arms together in the classic baby rocking position and rocked her own imaginary baby. Such a sweet mommy she will be one day! </p>
<p>Not too long after that Amelia sat up, showing me her darling old-fashioned little tweed coat with a brown velvet collar, a gift from a friend of Susan and Kevin's. Another grandma, walking by, stopped to admire her outfit. </p>
<p>Back at home (after spending quite a lot of time "walking" up the stairs.. which also involves crawling down more than once!) Amelia wolfed down her homemade mac' and cheese and the steamed carrots her mom had left out for her lunch. That was it though; she wasn't interested just then in the avocado, the fruit, or the applesauce. </p>
<p>I was singing "The Wheels on the Bus" to her during lunch though and that she was interested in. It is just amazing how quickly Amelia picks up on things; within minutes she was moving her hands in the "round and round" position, pushing out her hand for the "move on back" verse and asking for more and more. </p>
<p>We moved on into the living room where we attempted to read six books at once! We would get halfway through one, and on Amelia would go to the next one. Half way through that she would be off to choose yet another from a shelf, eventually returning to the first... and on it went. She is like Uncle Frank it seems and can read more than one book at a time! </p>
<p>Amelia also emptied out my purse and then happily carried around my keys, and a good sized piece of mashed banana in her other hand. Once in a while she would solemnly offer me a bite of the banana and then take a bite herself. Very appetizing! </p>
<p>Susan came home sooner than I expected her to; somehow our time always flies by! We sat in the living room watching Amelia entertain herself, putting on a show for the two of us with her antics. Oh, we had also played "Ring-Around-the-Rosy" so we showed her mommy that too. The funniest thing was watching Amelia almost instantly "fall down"; I guess that is her favourite part so she just did away with the middle section. Then out to the kitchen she travelled to put the new cotton summer clothes her mom had just bought for her into the large plastic garbage container! What a busy girl Amelia is and I can believe that Susan doesn't get a minute to herself in the house. </p>
<p>I got home in just enough time for a lovely long chat with Judith Sarkany, in Maryland; we will continue our conversation on Friday morning! </p>
<p>Doug and I had to dash out the door for a free sneak preview, a very funny German film about an accordian played, newly retired from his mining job, seeking fun and new experiences in Lousiana. We lined up for over an hour for our seats so treated ourselves to take out falafel and a big container of popcorn. This helped fill in the time 'til the movie started, although I don't really need an excuse to buy a big bag of popcorn!</p>
