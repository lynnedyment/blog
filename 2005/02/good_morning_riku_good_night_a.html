								<h2>Good Morning Riku; Good Night Amelia</h2>
								<p>After talking on Skype with all three of my sisters, I phoned to see how Riku was feeling. He was in fine form, reported his dad, back to his usual well and happy self. Riku came on the phone and said "good morning" to me for the very first time ever. </p>
<p>It was laundry day and I got it all done early in the day, then spent a couple of hours upstairs, finding permanent places for stacks of books and CM supplies, and vacuuming, dusting, and cleaning... boring housework chores that have been somewhat neglected lately. It's so much more fun to play with the children! However... </p>
<p>I had suggested to Susan that she drop Amelia off after their morning walk and lunch in Mill Valley, and she kindly agreed to do so. They arrived about 2 p.m. and we all had a bit of a visit together. Susan left about 2:30 or so, leaving us to get on with our day... and on with hers too.  </p>
<p>I love the way Amelia is so at home here, asking for the toys kept in the laundry room, going into the bathroom basket for Robin, and wandering into the living room to see what books are on the coffee table. She also loves to sit on Doug's lap and watch the kaleidescopes on his monitor and kept him busy insisting on this today. </p>
<p>The three of us went out for a walk in the Mission District. Amelia was asleep in under ten minutes and how she has changed! Walking through all the noise and busyness on 24th Street never wakens her anymore. In fact, Doug and I went into a taqueria on Mission for an early dinner burrito, and despite the quite loud 50's music playing Amelia slept peacefully on. </p>
<p>Just as we approached the house Amelia sat up, ready for whatever came next. An hour's sleep was just what she needed as it was later in the day than her normal afternoon naptime. </p>
<p>After a little time in the house we drove to Amelia's. Susan had her dinner out and ready to heat; Amelia ate every bit of the brown rice and spinach, as well as all but two tiny bites of a filled pasta. She tucked into a bit of the mixed fruits and ended up eating half of a small banana that I ate a little later on. </p>
<p>After some playtime in the living it was bath time and what fun she had. I put bubbles in, and lots of water tonight, and Amelia loved running her hands through the bubbles, pulling them up in the air covered with bubbles, and hiding her hands under them. A couple of times I asked her if she was ready to get up and for the very first time was told "noooo" very firmly. I can imagine that "no" will be a very favourite word very soon! Yesterday "baby" and today "no"... what will the next word be? </p>
<p>We all had some quiet time in the living room after Amelia was in her blanket sleeper and she spent most of it climbing up and down from Doug's lap, handing him many books, his Coke can, stuffed animals, and anything else she could think of. He was surrounded by oodles of various objects after ten minutes. She would start a book, get down to get another, flip through mine, kiss the snowy owl, get up on Doug's lap again, then onto the couch beside me... busy, busy, busy girl. </p>
<p>I was doing a favourite little relaxation exercise of Caillie's on Amelia tonight in the living room. She was sitting on my lap and I started singing "Criss cross, applesauce, spiders crawling up your arms... " and like every other child I have known, immediately asked for more the minute the last line was uttered. </p>
<p>Bed time and after about ten of this little ditty, Amelia was a limp puddle of relaxed baby, and continued on being relaxed after I put her into her crib. However, the creaking floor boards waken her each time, and it was impossible for me to leave the room without her hearing me. Susan and Kevin came home just before 9 p.m. after a movie (I hope!) and dinner out, to a little girl still not sleeping. One day... .</p>
