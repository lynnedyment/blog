								<h2>First Day at Ocean Beach in 2005</h2>
								<p>Skyped at 7:15 a.m. with only Candy and Beth this morning; Gail slept in until almost 9 a.m.! We're planning a list of just who will take what to Hawaii so we're not packing four deodorants, shampoos, etc. Fifteen days and counting! </p>
<p>I walked over to pick up Riku at 9 a.m. It was a gorgeous sunny morning and Riku had the sweetest new jacket on bought by Akane'a mom and dad... navy blue with embroidered rocket ships and lighthouses on it. We did our usual slow stroll back to 1361 with a stop at Lily's to say hello, as always. Today she ran into the back of the laundry and came out with a box of crackers for Riku; he carried them all the way home himself. I wish I had had the camera with me. </p>
<p>Riku played on his own in his room for a half hour, sorting through his cars and checking out the tin box filled with various animal figurines. Today there were new-to-him plastic animals from Bryn and Bryant... dinasaurs... and Riku enjoyed finding all of these in amongst the familiar ones. </p>
<p>"Drawing?", "Pencils", "Coloured Pencils" and "Paper?" are frequently heard words these days, and so while Riku drew swirls and cicles, and named letters that I drew for him, he also ate a huge bowl of oatmeal with berries, and finished off a small glass of organic apple juice as well. Whew! That was a loong sentence but a big meal for such a small fellow. </p>
<p>We played upstairs for a bit with the jewelry box and had some fun tent time together, but it was obvious that Riku needed a little nap. He slept for an hour, but woke up needing to be snuggled and held until he dropped off for another half hour. I think he was still not quite ready to get up at that point, but he came out of the room on his own, smiling, so we got on with our day. </p>
<p>Doug walked to the mailbox with Riku while I made him some lunch... ww pasta with tomato sauce, fresh tomatoes, broccoli, a little zucchini, and some shredded carrots. A bowl of homemade applesauce was his dessert and then it was time to go to Ocean Beach! We had made plans with Auntie Susan and Amelia to meet there, but Riku's longer nap kept us behind schedule a bit. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we did not connect at the beach after all (the cell phone Doug promised me for Christmas is going to come in very handy!) but Riku had a wonderful hour and a half there. He was quite content to sit on the beach playing with his sand toys, digging up feathers and bits of wood, and watching a large class of older children running on the beach. He did very little wandering, which was unusual but he seemed ready for this quiet instropective sitting time.</p>
<p>Susan and Amelia did find us just as we were all leaving for the day; she had a wonderful soft stuffed snowy owl toy for Riku. Susan was rewarded with a big smile when she handed it to him and Amelia put out her arms for me to hold her. Lucky us! </p>
<p>On the way home, Riku ate cookies and dried fruit for his snack, and then I popped him right into the tub when we got in. This is a lovely way for Riku to end his day here, as he enjoys his bath time so much. Today he played only with his letters (no boats, dolls, containers, etc), moving them about the tub, but mostly playing with the stream of water I kept going for him. </p>
<p>There was time for a yogurt and then lap and story time, with six books in all, each page carefully looked over and commented on. I had two new books with animal sounds for him, bought in Ontario, and he thoroughly enjoyed them. </p>
<p>His daddy came by for him just before 7 p.m. I ate a little dinner, caught up on a couple of taped shows, and came downstairs to do a little paper work. </p>
<p>Bryn called at 9:20 so that Riku could say goodnight to me, which he did! He had had a busy evening wandering around the Mission District, after dinner out with his mom, dad, and a friend of Bryn's. Bryn said he was going to bed too after  a few late nights working long hours.</p>
<p>... and off I go too. What a perfect February day!</p>
