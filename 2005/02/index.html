								<h2><a href="/2005/02/first_day_at_ocean_beach_in_20.html">First Day at Ocean Beach in 2005</a></h2>
								<p>Skyped at 7:15 a.m. with only Candy and Beth this morning; Gail slept in until almost 9 a.m.! We're planning a list of just who will take what to Hawaii so we're not packing four deodorants, shampoos, etc. Fifteen days and counting! </p>
<p>I walked over to pick up Riku at 9 a.m. It was a gorgeous sunny morning and Riku had the sweetest new jacket on bought by Akane'a mom and dad... navy blue with embroidered rocket ships and lighthouses on it. We did our usual slow stroll back to 1361 with a stop at Lily's to say hello, as always. Today she ran into the back of the laundry and came out with a box of crackers for Riku; he carried them all the way home himself. I wish I had had the camera with me. </p>
<p>Riku played on his own in his room for a half hour, sorting through his cars and checking out the tin box filled with various animal figurines. Today there were new-to-him plastic animals from Bryn and Bryant... dinasaurs... and Riku enjoyed finding all of these in amongst the familiar ones. </p>
<p>"Drawing?", "Pencils", "Coloured Pencils" and "Paper?" are frequently heard words these days, and so while Riku drew swirls and cicles, and named letters that I drew for him, he also ate a huge bowl of oatmeal with berries, and finished off a small glass of organic apple juice as well. Whew! That was a loong sentence but a big meal for such a small fellow. </p>
<p>We played upstairs for a bit with the jewelry box and had some fun tent time together, but it was obvious that Riku needed a little nap. He slept for an hour, but woke up needing to be snuggled and held until he dropped off for another half hour. I think he was still not quite ready to get up at that point, but he came out of the room on his own, smiling, so we got on with our day. </p>
<p>Doug walked to the mailbox with Riku while I made him some lunch... ww pasta with tomato sauce, fresh tomatoes, broccoli, a little zucchini, and some shredded carrots. A bowl of homemade applesauce was his dessert and then it was time to go to Ocean Beach! We had made plans with Auntie Susan and Amelia to meet there, but Riku's longer nap kept us behind schedule a bit. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we did not connect at the beach after all (the cell phone Doug promised me for Christmas is going to come in very handy!) but Riku had a wonderful hour and a half there. He was quite content to sit on the beach playing with his sand toys, digging up feathers and bits of wood, and watching a large class of older children running on the beach. He did very little wandering, which was unusual but he seemed ready for this quiet instropective sitting time.</p>
<p>Susan and Amelia did find us just as we were all leaving for the day; she had a wonderful soft stuffed snowy owl toy for Riku. Susan was rewarded with a big smile when she handed it to him and Amelia put out her arms for me to hold her. Lucky us! </p>
<p>On the way home, Riku ate cookies and dried fruit for his snack, and then I popped him right into the tub when we got in. This is a lovely way for Riku to end his day here, as he enjoys his bath time so much. Today he played only with his letters (no boats, dolls, containers, etc), moving them about the tub, but mostly playing with the stream of water I kept going for him. </p>
<p>There was time for a yogurt and then lap and story time, with six books in all, each page carefully looked over and commented on. I had two new books with animal sounds for him, bought in Ontario, and he thoroughly enjoyed them. </p>
<p>His daddy came by for him just before 7 p.m. I ate a little dinner, caught up on a couple of taped shows, and came downstairs to do a little paper work. </p>
<p>Bryn called at 9:20 so that Riku could say goodnight to me, which he did! He had had a busy evening wandering around the Mission District, after dinner out with his mom, dad, and a friend of Bryn's. Bryn said he was going to bed too after  a few late nights working long hours.</p>
<p>... and off I go too. What a perfect February day!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/02/amelia_time.html">Amelia Time</a></h2>
								<p>Today was another gorgeous sunny and warm day here. After chatting with my sisters and brother in the early morning, I dashed off to walk with Amelia in Golden Gate Park; it was time for her mom's annual physical. </p>
<p>Susan was walking her in the Panhandle when I arrived at 9:45. Amelia had dozed off waiting for me... it's always difficult to find parking in that neighbourhood on Wednesdays as it is street cleaning day. However, she opened her eyes long enough to give me a sleepy smile, and five minutes later she was fast asleep again. </p>
<p>I walked slowly, enjoying the sunshine, and did my usual stroll... through the rose garden, with all the pruned bushes waiting to bloom, to Stow Lake, walking around twice, enjoying the birds and stopping to take a couple of photos of the cherry blossoms and the California poppies. </p>
<p>After an hour and fifteen minutes a woman speaking very loudly walked by, waking Amelia. She kept her head down though and I started to sing "Rock-a-Bye Baby" to her, at which point she held her arms together in the classic baby rocking position and rocked her own imaginary baby. Such a sweet mommy she will be one day! </p>
<p>Not too long after that Amelia sat up, showing me her darling old-fashioned little tweed coat with a brown velvet collar, a gift from a friend of Susan and Kevin's. Another grandma, walking by, stopped to admire her outfit. </p>
<p>Back at home (after spending quite a lot of time "walking" up the stairs.. which also involves crawling down more than once!) Amelia wolfed down her homemade mac' and cheese and the steamed carrots her mom had left out for her lunch. That was it though; she wasn't interested just then in the avocado, the fruit, or the applesauce. </p>
<p>I was singing "The Wheels on the Bus" to her during lunch though and that she was interested in. It is just amazing how quickly Amelia picks up on things; within minutes she was moving her hands in the "round and round" position, pushing out her hand for the "move on back" verse and asking for more and more. </p>
<p>We moved on into the living room where we attempted to read six books at once! We would get halfway through one, and on Amelia would go to the next one. Half way through that she would be off to choose yet another from a shelf, eventually returning to the first... and on it went. She is like Uncle Frank it seems and can read more than one book at a time! </p>
<p>Amelia also emptied out my purse and then happily carried around my keys, and a good sized piece of mashed banana in her other hand. Once in a while she would solemnly offer me a bite of the banana and then take a bite herself. Very appetizing! </p>
<p>Susan came home sooner than I expected her to; somehow our time always flies by! We sat in the living room watching Amelia entertain herself, putting on a show for the two of us with her antics. Oh, we had also played "Ring-Around-the-Rosy" so we showed her mommy that too. The funniest thing was watching Amelia almost instantly "fall down"; I guess that is her favourite part so she just did away with the middle section. Then out to the kitchen she travelled to put the new cotton summer clothes her mom had just bought for her into the large plastic garbage container! What a busy girl Amelia is and I can believe that Susan doesn't get a minute to herself in the house. </p>
<p>I got home in just enough time for a lovely long chat with Judith Sarkany, in Maryland; we will continue our conversation on Friday morning! </p>
<p>Doug and I had to dash out the door for a free sneak preview, a very funny German film about an accordian played, newly retired from his mining job, seeking fun and new experiences in Lousiana. We lined up for over an hour for our seats so treated ourselves to take out falafel and a big container of popcorn. This helped fill in the time 'til the movie started, although I don't really need an excuse to buy a big bag of popcorn!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/02/its_post_time.html">It's Post Time!</a></h2>
								<p>Gail wasn't on Skype today, nor was Beth, so Candy, Glenn, and I chatted for about forty-five minutes. Just as I emailed Bryn to bring Riku over asap (Doug was on the phone), who shows up but Riku! I opened the door to meet them on the outside stairs and Riku shouted out "Hi Nana" in a big enthusiastic voice! Music to my ears that is... </p>
<p>Today he wanted "toys?" immediately meaning the big wicker basket filled with toys that is stored in the laundry room. He loves poking through it as there is always something new to be discovered; things go to the bottom and get "lost" there for weeks at a time. </p>
<p>Kelly had given me a pegboard for Riku and he was happy to sit at the table and spend some time doing that. I got his big bowl of hot cereal ready for him, and he ate every bit up on his own, and enjoyed a small glass of apple juice when he finished. </p>
<p>I sat at the table with him drinking my hot chocolate; for the very first time he asked for some, so I got out the small blue dotted china cup which I've had for years and years and filled it up halfway with hot chocolate. It was a big hit, and it was adorable the way that Riku held it so nicely by the tiny handle and then carefully put in on the saucer. He liked it so much he had a second helping, being just as careful with it the second time. He took little sips too and didn't just drink it all down.</p>
<p>Riku and I had time for some book reading too; today I read "The Carrot Seed" to him, another gift from Kelly, and did he just love that book! He has heard it before but today he really seemed to understand what was going on with the story. We read it three times today and it went in the car with us too. We also read "The Very Quiet Cricket" several times as he just loved getting to that last page and hearing the cricket sounds. Riku sat quietly in the kitchen today turning one page after another, looking carefully at a favourite ABC book Doug had bought for him many months ago. I think we have a little reader on our hands. Lovely.  </p>
<p>Nap time followed and Riku slept for an hour and twenty minutes, snuggled up with his entourage of monkey, two dogs, and two mice. He woke at one point and asked me to "hold you" meaning for me to hold him. I suppose because I always tell him I will "hold you" when he is going for his nap he feels that is how he should be asking. </p>
<p>After his nap, Riku explored his room for a bit, picking up his cars and putting together the bear dress-up puzzle from Auntie Kelly. We all ate lunch together and Riku ate every bite of his pasta with tomatoes, broccoli, and mushrooms as well as his bowl of chunky applesauce. </p>
<p>And then we were off to the races! I had been telling Riku earlier that we would go and see the horses running very fast and he seemed very interested in it. He was a bit sleepy on our way out to the Hillsdale Meadows Racetrack, which surprised me after his good nap, but he managed to stay awake and was happy to walk to the stadium.</p>
<p> Susan and Amelia met us there not long after and the two of them made it obvious that what was really exciting about the racetrack were the rows and rows of steps, and all the long row of seats! It was hard to get either of them very enthused about the horses running by, although Amelia was very excited to see them up close in the paddocks between races. Riku was far more interested in the game machines, pushing all the buttons, the levers, and checking out the change return pockets on each and every one of them. It was quite a struggle to get him up for the next race! </p>
<p>Susan and I each bet on three races and proved that we would be better off just madly guessing at which horse might win, and not picking out the horse that appealed to us the most. This was my very first time at a horse race, and it looked just like they do in the movies! Talk about colourful characters! It was lots of fun, and I anticipate going again with the four older children in March. I think we'll hold off on the younger two until they are four or five years old. By then Amelia will no doubt be riding and will be much more interested in the horses although I have a feeling that Riku will still be more interested in exploring. He had such a great time walking back to the car; he had found a great stick and lots of holes and dirt to poke it into! </p>
<p>Less than three minutes into the ride home Riku was sound asleep with his head resting against his "big dog". Doug drove to a couple of different stores running errands just to make the car ride last longer and Riku slept for another hour and twenty minutes. </p>
<p>We didn't have too long at home as his Dad and Mom came to pick him up for an office party just after 6 p.m; he had a few minutes on the keyboard making loud sounds, listened to some Raffi songs, ate a little French toast, and played with the basket of toys before they arrived. It was a little bit of a fast departure but the promise of some play time with Brent seemed to do the trick!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/02/saturday_market.html">Saturday Market</a></h2>
								<p>This morning at 9:40 Doug and I picked up Akane and Riku for a trip to the Alemany Market just outside the city; Bryn was at his three hour Japanese language course. </p>
<p>Riku was in fine form, as he really enjoys wandering through the market, often wanting go solo (although this is often difficult as it is <strong>so</strong> busy there). He often reaches out to hold hands though, and occasionally wants to be lifted up. Mostly he enjoys stopping to pick up a big stalk of broccoli ("Yum! yum!", says Riku!), pat as many dogs as he is allowed to, or just stop and say a big "Hi!" to random people. They almost all respond to him at this market and with big smiles directed right back to him. Such a social butterfly is our Riku! </p>
<p>We bought mushrooms, kiwi, daikon radish, cheese curds, pecorino cheese, dates, oranges, raspberry jam, Yukon Gold potatoes, and a big bag of "kettle corn". I made the mistake of telling Riku he could have some popcorn and of course he wouldn't hear of eating anything else in the car. At least he ate the entire container of oatmeal and mixed berries I had taken along with me; he polished it off in the car on the way to the market. So he and I sat happily nibbling our way through the popcorn, and once we reached his house I went upstairs to put some in a bowl for him and in a bag for his parents. </p>
<p>Riku was ready for a nap and Doug and I headed off to a movie, a Chinese action film called "Infernal Affairs"; it was well acted and I liked it although I did think that I could have gotten a lot done at home during that time! Doug and I finished the last of the popcorn though, and it's always relaxing to just sit back and be entertained.</p>
<p>We had an hour at home before dashing off for a house party at a friend of Doug's. I had made Nanaimo Bars in the morning to take along and we both enjoyed the wide variety of main course dishes waiting for us... a pasta dish, two vegetarian soups, a Thai noodle dish, a delicious quiche, olives, and the desserts! There were more of them than main dishes, I think, although I just indulged in some dark chocolate a couple of hours after dinner was over. </p>
<p>The best part of the evening was meeting the mother of a darling little five month old boy named Liam. I had met his parents once before but tonight really had a chance to chat with her. She invited us over to see a movie on Saturday so I will see Liam once again... what a treat to look forward to! Home at midnight. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/02/rikus_first_fever.html">Riku's First Fever</a></h2>
								<p>Rriday Bryn had asked if we would like to go over to Hampshire Street for breakfast today, and I completely forgot about it! He called right in the nick of time though as Doug hadn't eaten. As soon as Doug had showered off we went. Bryn and Riku had been out to buy croissants at their favourite bakery, and Riku fell asleep on the car ride home. It was early, only 9 a.m. but he had wakened early too. Bryn managed to successfully transfer him to his bed and he was still sleeping when we arrived at 9:20. </p>
<p>Bryn cooked up some Yukon Gold potatoes, and scrambled eggs, there was  delicious sweet French toast-like treat to share, and warm croissants with Judi's strawberry jam. Riku woke up just as we were sitting down and ate one bite of egg and two bites of croissant with us. Akane made a pot of tea and we chatted about movies and trips coming up. </p>
<p>Doug and I walked back home and spent an hour there... Doug on the computer and I vacuuming the downstairs and tidying up the master bedroom... finding a place for puzzles that Riku and Amelia will enjoy a few years from now. </p>
<p>Off we went to see a movie, a wonderful movie called "Born into Brothels", a documentary set in Calcutta about the children of "lane workers". I think that every person in the theatre had tears in their eyes at the end of it; it was beautifully told and yet both sad and happy. </p>
<p>We stopped to pick up Riku at 3:10 so Akane and Bryn could go off to see a movie. Doug and I took Riku to a new playground in the Mission. It is lacking a sandbox but Riku thoroughly enjoyed climbing the stairs to the slide and exploring the "big kids" area for the longest time. </p>
<p>Back at home an hour later, I made Riku a big bowl of four grain cereal with berries and he ate every bite of it. He also had some drawing time, which gives him such great pleasure. He carefully takes the lids off the coloured markers, uses them, and then replaces the caps. Akane told me he did the same with pens at the pre-school she is hoping to get him into next year, and the teacher was so impressed. He tidied it all up when told they had to move on to another area. </p>
<p>Riku collected his tin of plastic animals and sat on the mat in the kitchen while I cleaned mushrooms and made a batch of Nanaimo bars. A few minutes later I noticed that he was lying on the rug with his face down... very unusual. Jokingly I asked him if he was a tired boy and he just turned his head to the other side. I went over, picked him up and asked if he wanted me to tuck him into bed. He just snuggled in and put his head on my arm in our usual going-to-sleep position. I was astounded; this was a first and it was then that I noticed how hot he was. He let me carry him into his room, turn on the sound machine (he always does this himself!), I took off everything but his diaper and tshirt as always, and sang to him. Less than two songs later he was sound asleep. It was 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Akane and Bryn came in 6:25 from their movie and Riku was standing on a chair playing in water in the kitchen sink. I pulled on a little pair of jogging pants but left his feet bare and just the tshirt on to keep him cool. No socks or slippers either and he happily played for a half hour with the water and some containers. </p>
<p>We all had dinner together; I had pasta on cooking when they arrived and put it together with some fresh basil and Buffalo mozzarella cheese from Susan. A salad and some English custard for dessert gave us a quick and easy meal. </p>
<p>Riku just wanted to snuggle and read "in other room" so off to the living room we went while everyone ate. I gently rubbed his tummy and back with my cool fingers; he was really hot and didn't mind my touching him a bit. After three books, we went back to join the others at the table so that Riku could eat a bowl of custard and some of his dad's as well, a good sign that he is a little hungry. He had nursed when his mom first came in too, so was a happy boy. </p>
<p>I hope whatever bug has caused our wee guy such a fever will be gone by tomorrow; he wasn't miserable with it, but did want to be comforted and quiet. Poor little fellow... I wonder how he is doing now, almost three hours later.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/02/good_morning_riku_good_night_a.html">Good Morning Riku; Good Night Amelia</a></h2>
								<p>After talking on Skype with all three of my sisters, I phoned to see how Riku was feeling. He was in fine form, reported his dad, back to his usual well and happy self. Riku came on the phone and said "good morning" to me for the very first time ever. </p>
<p>It was laundry day and I got it all done early in the day, then spent a couple of hours upstairs, finding permanent places for stacks of books and CM supplies, and vacuuming, dusting, and cleaning... boring housework chores that have been somewhat neglected lately. It's so much more fun to play with the children! However... </p>
<p>I had suggested to Susan that she drop Amelia off after their morning walk and lunch in Mill Valley, and she kindly agreed to do so. They arrived about 2 p.m. and we all had a bit of a visit together. Susan left about 2:30 or so, leaving us to get on with our day... and on with hers too.  </p>
<p>I love the way Amelia is so at home here, asking for the toys kept in the laundry room, going into the bathroom basket for Robin, and wandering into the living room to see what books are on the coffee table. She also loves to sit on Doug's lap and watch the kaleidescopes on his monitor and kept him busy insisting on this today. </p>
<p>The three of us went out for a walk in the Mission District. Amelia was asleep in under ten minutes and how she has changed! Walking through all the noise and busyness on 24th Street never wakens her anymore. In fact, Doug and I went into a taqueria on Mission for an early dinner burrito, and despite the quite loud 50's music playing Amelia slept peacefully on. </p>
<p>Just as we approached the house Amelia sat up, ready for whatever came next. An hour's sleep was just what she needed as it was later in the day than her normal afternoon naptime. </p>
<p>After a little time in the house we drove to Amelia's. Susan had her dinner out and ready to heat; Amelia ate every bit of the brown rice and spinach, as well as all but two tiny bites of a filled pasta. She tucked into a bit of the mixed fruits and ended up eating half of a small banana that I ate a little later on. </p>
<p>After some playtime in the living it was bath time and what fun she had. I put bubbles in, and lots of water tonight, and Amelia loved running her hands through the bubbles, pulling them up in the air covered with bubbles, and hiding her hands under them. A couple of times I asked her if she was ready to get up and for the very first time was told "noooo" very firmly. I can imagine that "no" will be a very favourite word very soon! Yesterday "baby" and today "no"... what will the next word be? </p>
<p>We all had some quiet time in the living room after Amelia was in her blanket sleeper and she spent most of it climbing up and down from Doug's lap, handing him many books, his Coke can, stuffed animals, and anything else she could think of. He was surrounded by oodles of various objects after ten minutes. She would start a book, get down to get another, flip through mine, kiss the snowy owl, get up on Doug's lap again, then onto the couch beside me... busy, busy, busy girl. </p>
<p>I was doing a favourite little relaxation exercise of Caillie's on Amelia tonight in the living room. She was sitting on my lap and I started singing "Criss cross, applesauce, spiders crawling up your arms... " and like every other child I have known, immediately asked for more the minute the last line was uttered. </p>
<p>Bed time and after about ten of this little ditty, Amelia was a limp puddle of relaxed baby, and continued on being relaxed after I put her into her crib. However, the creaking floor boards waken her each time, and it was impossible for me to leave the room without her hearing me. Susan and Kevin came home just before 9 p.m. after a movie (I hope!) and dinner out, to a little girl still not sleeping. One day... .</p>
