								<h2>It's Post Time!</h2>
								<p>Gail wasn't on Skype today, nor was Beth, so Candy, Glenn, and I chatted for about forty-five minutes. Just as I emailed Bryn to bring Riku over asap (Doug was on the phone), who shows up but Riku! I opened the door to meet them on the outside stairs and Riku shouted out "Hi Nana" in a big enthusiastic voice! Music to my ears that is... </p>
<p>Today he wanted "toys?" immediately meaning the big wicker basket filled with toys that is stored in the laundry room. He loves poking through it as there is always something new to be discovered; things go to the bottom and get "lost" there for weeks at a time. </p>
<p>Kelly had given me a pegboard for Riku and he was happy to sit at the table and spend some time doing that. I got his big bowl of hot cereal ready for him, and he ate every bit up on his own, and enjoyed a small glass of apple juice when he finished. </p>
<p>I sat at the table with him drinking my hot chocolate; for the very first time he asked for some, so I got out the small blue dotted china cup which I've had for years and years and filled it up halfway with hot chocolate. It was a big hit, and it was adorable the way that Riku held it so nicely by the tiny handle and then carefully put in on the saucer. He liked it so much he had a second helping, being just as careful with it the second time. He took little sips too and didn't just drink it all down.</p>
<p>Riku and I had time for some book reading too; today I read "The Carrot Seed" to him, another gift from Kelly, and did he just love that book! He has heard it before but today he really seemed to understand what was going on with the story. We read it three times today and it went in the car with us too. We also read "The Very Quiet Cricket" several times as he just loved getting to that last page and hearing the cricket sounds. Riku sat quietly in the kitchen today turning one page after another, looking carefully at a favourite ABC book Doug had bought for him many months ago. I think we have a little reader on our hands. Lovely.  </p>
<p>Nap time followed and Riku slept for an hour and twenty minutes, snuggled up with his entourage of monkey, two dogs, and two mice. He woke at one point and asked me to "hold you" meaning for me to hold him. I suppose because I always tell him I will "hold you" when he is going for his nap he feels that is how he should be asking. </p>
<p>After his nap, Riku explored his room for a bit, picking up his cars and putting together the bear dress-up puzzle from Auntie Kelly. We all ate lunch together and Riku ate every bite of his pasta with tomatoes, broccoli, and mushrooms as well as his bowl of chunky applesauce. </p>
<p>And then we were off to the races! I had been telling Riku earlier that we would go and see the horses running very fast and he seemed very interested in it. He was a bit sleepy on our way out to the Hillsdale Meadows Racetrack, which surprised me after his good nap, but he managed to stay awake and was happy to walk to the stadium.</p>
<p> Susan and Amelia met us there not long after and the two of them made it obvious that what was really exciting about the racetrack were the rows and rows of steps, and all the long row of seats! It was hard to get either of them very enthused about the horses running by, although Amelia was very excited to see them up close in the paddocks between races. Riku was far more interested in the game machines, pushing all the buttons, the levers, and checking out the change return pockets on each and every one of them. It was quite a struggle to get him up for the next race! </p>
<p>Susan and I each bet on three races and proved that we would be better off just madly guessing at which horse might win, and not picking out the horse that appealed to us the most. This was my very first time at a horse race, and it looked just like they do in the movies! Talk about colourful characters! It was lots of fun, and I anticipate going again with the four older children in March. I think we'll hold off on the younger two until they are four or five years old. By then Amelia will no doubt be riding and will be much more interested in the horses although I have a feeling that Riku will still be more interested in exploring. He had such a great time walking back to the car; he had found a great stick and lots of holes and dirt to poke it into! </p>
<p>Less than three minutes into the ride home Riku was sound asleep with his head resting against his "big dog". Doug drove to a couple of different stores running errands just to make the car ride last longer and Riku slept for another hour and twenty minutes. </p>
<p>We didn't have too long at home as his Dad and Mom came to pick him up for an office party just after 6 p.m; he had a few minutes on the keyboard making loud sounds, listened to some Raffi songs, ate a little French toast, and played with the basket of toys before they arrived. It was a little bit of a fast departure but the promise of some play time with Brent seemed to do the trick!</p>
