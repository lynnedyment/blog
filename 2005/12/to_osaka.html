								<h2>To Osaka</h2>
								<p>I awoke a half hour before Riku this morning; he rolled over to put his hands on my face at 7:15, a nice long sleep. He didn't cough at all last night and only started sounding stuffy in the hour before he woke up. Once awake, however, he had some hard coughs, which Bryn said are typical in the mornings, and he's pale, despite the long sleep. </p>
<p>He ate a good breakfast of porridge, 1/2 banana, 3/4 of a piece of toast, and some veg/fruit juice, which was reassuring. I decided not to go to school with him this morning; he was protesting from the time he woke up, and I don't want to possibly be making it worse by being there. Bryn and Akane walked him over today but Bryn said he cried for them as well, which wasn't fun to know but at least I know it wasn't me making it harder for him. Riku asked one of the teachers to hold him, and she was as they left him. </p>
<p>I Skyped with Doug, wrote an email to my sisters, and made myself some hot chocolate and toast for breakfast. Akane and Bryn had gone out for a quick breakfast at a tiny local cafe and when they arrived home we decided we would spend a few hours in Osaka this afternoon. I went through the last of the magazines I had brought with me, while Bryn worked and Akane was on her computer. Now I wish I had brought a dozen or more of the magazines as I have so many to go through and so little time at home. </p>
<p>We caught the 1:06 train to Namba, one of the huge and bustling shopping areas in Osaka. Our first stop was at the Canadian Consulate to get the paper work for Mirei Elizabeth before her birth. We had to wait twenty minutes for someone to get back from lunch hour and Bryn managed to find their names in the guest book from three years ago for Riku's passport visit. It was three years and one day from today. When the clerk returned, Bryn got an envelope stuffed with all that is required to get the baby started toward her Canadian passport. </p>
<p>Bryn and I both wanted to wander through Uniglo, a very reasonably priced clothing store with great quality clothing, a somewhat rare combination here. Bryn buys all his jeans, tshirts, socks and underwear here, and some of Riku's clothes are purchased here as well. I needed more time than we had, but did buy a very lightweight turtleneck top, for $10, and had a good look at some two-piece top and slacks outfits for Caillie to replace the ones that didn't fit for her birthday gifts. </p>
<p>I went to the restroom in the store and saw a new feature on the toilet there... a button you push that sounds like a flushing toilet but is really just camoflage for any indiscreet noies one might make! It was certainly very authentic sounding and worth a photo too, which I took.</p>
<p>I would have liked to wander around the store much longer, but we had to pick Riku up at school at 5 p.m. and needed to get moving. There will be other chances. Off we went to get some wonderful basil french fries I remembered from three years ago. They weren't making them anymore but we chose some "butter" fries which came with various toppings, Bryn and Akane both had a sandwich with theirs and I was to share Bryn's and ordered myself a small margherita pizza. None of it was wonderful and even though I ate every bite of my pizza and polished off the end of the fries, we decided we wouldn't go back there again. I should have eaten a more substantial breakfast or not waited so long for lunch; once I'm hungry all discretion goes out the window! </p>
<p>We dashed to get back to Riku and made it in lots of time. He was busy playing happily with the little kitchen, his favourite spot of all, and even though he was glad to see us he played for a few more minutes before getting ready to leave. Once out the door though it was obvious that he was just wiped out. Bryn and Akane decided to go in and talk to the staff to see if there was a possibility of arranging his days so that he doesn't have two days back to back. With eight-hour days, it might make him happier to have a day in between to be at home with a less active day. </p>
<p>While they were talking to the teacher, Riku and I waited in the park. It was getting dark, but we were wandering about, and ran into one of the twins from my visit last May... Yui, with her big brother. It was such fun to see her again, and before long Aya came along too. We had a nice little reunion before Akane and Bryn joined us. We introduced them to Bryn too, and off we went for home. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane went to the store downstairs, and I came up with Riku to get him fed immediately. Dinner was on the table for him in less than ten minutes, and then it was story time and tuck-in.   </p>
<p>Bryn assured Riku when they came home that he would not be going to school for two and maybe three days as... and at this point he asked Riku what day it was tomorrow, to which Riku responded "it's the weekend!" not long after Akane and Bryn left to meet Ayako downstairs.</p>
<p>They are all off for a steak dinner, won by Ayako in a contest. The restaurant is in one of the biggest hotels in Sakai City and it was pretty good, but not excellent. </p>
<p>I finally got another blog written, although Riku woke up a couple of times, so I got into my pajamas early and washed so I could just crawl in with him when it was my bedtime too. Riku coughed a bit when he first went to bed, but was fine the rest of the evening. Bedtime at 11 p.m. after Akane and Bryn returned home; we had time to catch up on our news before saying goodnight.</p>
