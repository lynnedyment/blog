								<h2>Cold and Rainy... Sakai City</h2>
								<p>Riku and I woke at 7 a.m. today. He was a happy boy, going into the kitchen to see his dad sitting at the table working. Bryn got his "O"s out, his favourite morning meal right now, and he watched his TV show while eating some toast and an orange. He has been peeling his own mandarins lately and does so by first sticking an index finger in the top, to start a hole (a la "he put in his thumb and pulled out a plum!") and then deftly peels and sections it. </p>
<p>I had a bit of Skype time with Myk' and Bry' this morning and it was lovely to have a little chat with them. They caught me up on some news... the puppy is doing well, although now barking in the night; their music concert went very well; and I am not going to miss the annual Dyment/Tilston/Feldmann sugar cookie decorating party after all, since school lets out for the holidays this year on the 23rd! This is quite a bit later than usual, but they don't return to school until the 9th of January. </p>
<p>Bryant told me he liked Island school even though he got in trouble from one of the teachers for talking too early in the morning; sounds like he was just the one who got caught, though. </p>
<p>Caillie was diagnosed with pneumonia last Friday but Gregg told me she had an amazing recovery over the next three days, which was good to hear. I spoke with Kelly briefly, and then with Doug who had been put on hold while I spoke with the Ontario crowd. They are harder to find in on any given day, given their crazy schedules, and three hours later than SF. </p>
<p>Kelly and I had some time to IM about Christmas gifts; there are so many wonderful and very inexpensive clothes to be found at one of Akane's and Bryn's favourite stores here... Uniqlo so this will make some gift shopping easy. </p>
<p>Susan sent some gorgeous photos of Amelia today, one lot taken in the rain the day before, and another series of shots taken at various times. Amelia is such a ham, and of course gets herself into such funny situations.</p>
<p>I had decided to get out for some fresh air and a walk today on my own, as I am feeling the lack of exercise these past few days. Riku, who was obviously not feeling well, didn't approve at all when I said I was going; he cried and said "Nana stay home. No going out." and so  I decided it was too cold anyway. It was very windy today and much colder than I expected it to be when I hung some laundry out on the balcony. </p>
<p>Akane was busy puttering about the apartment this morning and in the early afternoon. This is a good sign for the baby's arrival, as often that little "nest building" urge kicks in. We can only hope, as her doctor told her he will induce her once her due date arrives. Let's hope Mirei Elizabeth heard that and decides to come into the world on her own terms. </p>
<p>After Riku had taken his medicine, which contains a decongestant, it seemed to kick in and make it obvious that he needed an early nap. He decided he would nap with his mommy, and she was fine with that, but unfortunately it didn't happen. Bryn and I were at the computers in the dining room, could hear thumps of feet against the wall, chatting from a certain little person, a little crying, protests against being urged to sleep, and finally calling out for me. Of course I brook no nonsense and took him into his room, lay down with him, told him he was to go to sleep now, and after a few thumps and protests for me too, fell into a sleep. He napped an hour and a half and needed it. </p>
<p>Akane made him fried rice for his late lunch, full of finely chopped veggies, and he ate a good-sized portion of it. It's great that despite feeling so tough Riku has been eating well throughout it all. </p>
<p>About 3 p.m. we all headed off to the gelato place I discovered in May. Akane had been a few days before I arrived, and told the owner I would be here soon, and I fully intended to get there before now. Akane was reluctant to go with us, as she had been busy in the house with the cooking and laundry too, but Bryn talked her into it. We went outside to discover it had started to rain, but lightly, so we continued on. It's only a fifteen minute walk, and of course because of the rain it was milder than it had been earlier. It was most pleasant, and Riku enjoyed it too, looking at the interesting things along the way that he spotted... like the cow-looking spots on a building! </p>
<p>The gal behind the counter recognized me when we walked in, and let the owner know we were there. He came out with a nice big smile to greet me; took my hand and shook it and placed his other hand on top... accompanied of course by a bow as well. He did the same with Bryn when I introduced him and then we each set about the business of choosing a flavour. After many offers of various new and familiar gelatos we were ready with our order; I had marscapone with black beans... sounds strange I know but it was really delicious, Bryn had mango, Akane had strawberry, and Riku chose vanilla with chocolate bits. He didn't like the big pieces of frozen chocolate though and passed them on to his dad when they were "too crunchy!" </p>
<p>I took some photos of Riku, Akane, and Bryn eating their little cups of gelato, sitting side by side on the long bench. Then the owner took  mine with them, and I coaxed him into posing for a photo with me, something I was sorry I didn't do in May. He promised he would make coconut gelato for me for tomorrow... what a lovely man! Not only did he remember how much I liked it, but isn't even going to make me wait too long for it. Riku sat like a little treasure, daintily eating tiny bites of his, asking "would you like to taste mine?" of his Mommy, Daddy, and me, and then happily tasting bites of ours too. "This is delicious!" he exclaimed when he tasted mine, but chose not to taste one of the soft black beans. </p>
<p>The rain had pretty much stopped on the way home and we all agreed it had been good to get out. Bryn and Akane stopped for a few groceries, and Riku and I came up on our own. He spent a long time drawing today, making the most beautiful stack of colours and also playing with his fire station while watching the evening children's show on TV. </p>
<p>Akane made a delicious dinner for us of mixed vegetables in light sauce, served with rice. It was great and a small bowl was perfect after having had dessert first tonight. </p>
<p>Riku had his first tub here; both Akane and Bryn have been showering and Riku showers with his dad, but I know how much he enjoys playing in the tub. It's relaxing too, and the steam in the room is good for his chest. I had cleaned the tub earlier and Akane had partially filled it, so after dinner in he went. What a happy boy he was with five containers to pour from and into! He also likes being wrapped up in the towel like a baby, even when the towel isn't heated the way it is at Nana's in SF. I read him his story in bed and tucked him in at 7:30; he was sound asleep at 8 p.m. </p>
<p>However, not an hour later he was awake, crying and coughing. He would settle down very quickly, be in a deep sleep, snoring quietly, and then the cough would hit again. At one point, we were all quite alarmed as it seemed he wasn't able to breathe; what a scary thing that was! I just held him and it passed but he will be going back to the doctor in two days, when his medication is finished. <br />
As a result of Riku's coughing and upsets, the  rest of the evening was a short one... I wrote a couple of emails, and did a little knitting on Candy's scarf which I have been working at whenever I sit down with Riku for meals, or when I don't have computer access. There are times when Bryn needs both computers; it might be time to get a laptop of my own! </p>
<p>Bedtime early... 10:30 p.m. as Riku is calling out frequently, at one point saying "Play-Doh" in a loud voice!</p>
