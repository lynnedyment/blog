								<h2>Everyone is Waiting... for Mirei</h2>
								<p>Riku woke up at 6:45 today, willing to snuggle for a few more minutes but obviously ready to get up and start his day. He ate more lightly this morning than usual but made up for it tonight! </p>
<p>It's a school day and after his dad reminded him about it, he clearly stated and with great feeling "Riku not go to school today!" Bryn handled it very well, saying it was a school day, but tomorrow was the weekend. He also took a special treat along with him, a piece of caramel chocolate to give to him when he left him. </p>
<p>Bryn came home at 9:15 telling us it had gone more smoothly that he could have hoped for... not one comment about "no school" on the way there, no hesitency when approaching or going into the school, no tears, and just a nice "bye Daddy" when Bryn left him. What a relief to hear this; we had also reminded him when we go to pick him up he isn't ready to leave and he seems to have remembered that. </p>
<p>I answered a couple of fast emails before showering, did quite a bit of knitting, tidied up my paper work in the bedroom, and washed out a couple of blouses. Time for one more email before dashing off to meet Kei for lunch. I had invited her out on Wednesday and was so pleased her mother-in-law said she would babysit for her. </p>
<p>Akane had phoned the restaurant last night to ask if they would make a non-meat or fish broth for me, and so when we walked in at 11:50 they were prepared for me. Akane had also written a note, complete with a drawing, of two dishes I would like. They were exactly what we had last week and were just as delicious... tofu and broccoli hot pot (it was okra last week though), and then a mixed veggie, mushroom, and more tofu! with noodle dish. Kei had never eaten here before and liked it very much. We managed to chat a lot, with a little help from Kei's dictionary at one point to find the word "labour" as I had asked her what hers was like. </p>
<p>We are invited to their home tomorrow for tea at 4 p.m. after the children's naps. Kei apologized in advance for how tiny her house is, and how crowded it is. I know that it's unusual to be invited into a Japanese home, so feel very honoured that Kei is comfortable enough with us all to do this. We managed to polish off every last bit of our lunch before I had to dash for the 1 p.m. meeting with Akane and Bryn at the train. </p>
<p>Off to Namba, one of the main shopping areas in downtown Osaka. It was bustling as usual, but we managed to be very efficient and got lots done... my bit of shopping at Uniqlo, with two new turtlenecks for myself, Bryn bought a quilted but light down jacket, off to "Afternoon Tea", a lovely shop with three floors, to look for cards (I bought a large number of these as they are so different, and yet affordable), and then into another nine-floor store, quite inexpensive, called "Tokyu Hands", but nothing there tempted me at all. </p>
<p>We had decided to stop for a cup of tea/coffee and a dessert and had stopped in at a French cafe, but after realizing that a cup of tea in the smoky environment was going to cost $7, we decided we would leave and find something else. That ended up being four "Beard Papa's" cream puffs eaten at home. Perfect, and my tea was exactly as I like it too. </p>
<p>The train arrived here at 4:45 and we went right over to the school. Riku, as usual, was happily playing, today dragging a long apron and the ties along the floor, and interacting with another child, and one of the male teachers. Once again, he was in no hurry to leave at all, and we finally managed to corral him and get him dressed. One of the teachers told us he hadn't cried once all day, not even at nap time and had slept for an hour and 40 minutes. He ate all his salmon and vegetables at lunch time, and they were out in the playground for part of the morning. All is well, and we were all so pleased to hear it! </p>
<p>Since going to school, Riku has been carrying his dishes to the kitchen when he finishes eating here at home. They have a low sink with three taps at school and rinse out their own milk bottles and tidy up after themselves. The second time I was there to pick Riku up he was struggling to put his chair on top of another, stacking them for the next day. It may be a co-incidence but he has also been emptying the waste basket each morning from the bathroom into the kitchen garbage pail. Such a helper! </p>
<p>Bryn asked if I would take care of Riku while he and Akane went out for a sushi dinner, and of course I was happy to have the time with him. We had such a wonderful three hours together this evening. I made him porridge again for dinner with apples and almonds finely sliced into it, then he asked for toast, and had two small tomatoes after that. His dessert was two big strawberries followed by half a cream puff, that I forgot I was supposed to save for after the BM we had told Riku we wanted in the toilet tonight. He has been protesting the idea for the past two days, but it's time. </p>
<p>So, as soon as he had finished eating... which took a while!, I took off his pants and diaper, and let him wander around half naked. Eventually he felt the need to go, and let me know. I had told him we would read some books in the bathroom and we did... two Caillou books, one of which showed Caillou on the toilet! Nothing happened however, so he popped off and sat on the floor to play with his garage. A few minutes later though, he asked me if I had to use the toilet. I went along with it and sat down pretending to try to go; Riku "read" to me, and then out of the blue said "Plop!" and then said "I have a surprise for you! What would you like?" He dashed into the living room, brought me back my surprise, telling me first to "open your hands and close your eyes; I put in a big surprise!" and there was the helicopter I had always wanted! </p>
<p>I was washing the dishes when he told me again he had to go; two new books, a little concentration, and then success! He was so pleased with himself and I think we're on the way to a toilet-trained boy. </p>
<p>Face washed, teeth brushed, PJs on, one Nicky book, and fifteen minutes later I had a tired little boy sound asleep, at 7:45. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn came in not much later with chestnut gelato for me; it is delicious as it's not too sweet and with a very subtle flavour. I have 2/3 of it left for tomorrow. Unlike Riku, I ate the entire cream puff. They had had a wonderful dinner at a local spot, in a well-heeled neighbourhood, just a few blocks from the gelato spot, and were pleasantly surprised at how inexpensive it was. Bryn had a particular brand of saki, recommended by another customer, and Akane chatted with a third staff person about their pregancies; this woman too was expecting her second baby, but not as soon as Akane! Bryn said they didn't have one of the special dishes on the menu... raw horse, called "cherry blossom". Ugh! Akane isn't interested at all, and Bryn said he would have needed to have more to drink to be talked into it. </p>
<p>Akane's lower back has been aching all day, and Mirei was moving less this morning, so of course we had high hopes that today might be the day, but tonight she is on the move again, and Akane's back is still aching... maybe tomorrow.</p>
