								<h2>Short... But Still not Short Enough!</h2>
								<p>That's my new motto for blogging. After months of knowing my blogs were far too detailed I have decided make them short and sweet. So, yesterday in a nutshell... </p>
<p>Happy, busy morning for Riku playing on his own for the longest time, "fixing" his car by piling lots of toys on top of it. He also worked with his dad taking apart a great airplane they built last night. And there was time for drawing and eating and snacking too. </p>
<p>We met Tomoha, and her parents, Kei and Shigeru, in the park at 10 a.m. Cold and crisp, but clear, and the bonus was meeting up with a nice woman we met in May last year. She was there almost every day walking her small Dachshund, which Riku loved to pat. She speaks English quite well, so we chatted a bit, and I took her photo with Riku. She also told me the man with the four dogs who took Riku's and my photos last spring was away hiking in the mountains, so we quite likely won't be seeing him. </p>
<p>From there, we walked to Riku's school to play in the playground; Riku's teacher was there and he was a bit apprehensive about being there, but eventually believed that we were there just to play. Our visit ended with an hour in a playroom on the third floor, with a "ballroom" area, and two slides.</p>
<p>After lunch Riku had a three hour nap, ending at 5:40, when I opened the door, turned off the sound machine, while he finished it up with some snuggling with his mom. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane planned for us to have dinner at a local okonomiyaki place, within five minutes of the condo. We walked over and found the restaurant completely empty, even of the owner, but he soon showed up, turned on the grill and started cooking our dinners... a base of cabbage, flour, egg, tempura crumbs, and sticky yam, with added green onions, pickled ginger, and varying other ingredients such as pork, shrimp, squid, oysters, etc. Each restaurant has its own style and/or variants and can taste quite different... but similar. Riku was not content to sit there while they cooked, and I decided it would be best to take him home for his dinner and have mine brought home to me later on. </p>
<p>We stopped in at the "Little Mermaid" bakery downstairs and picked up a few baked treats for us... a golf ball sized cream-filled pastry, a bun for Riku, and one for me topped with pumpkin seeds. </p>
<p>Riku was eating the noodles and veggies soup I prepared for him, when Akane and Bryn came home, and after eating a half portion of my okonomiyaki, I (with help from Bryn) got Riku into his PJs and he was tucked in at 8:30. Wakened a number of times, just not going into a deep sleep, so I went in to him at 9:30, "Put your head down Nana"... and woke up, fully clothed, teeth unbrushed, face unwashed, and thirsty at 1:30 a.m.! Very atypical for me to fall asleep when lying with him... and getting ready properly for bed after sleeping for five hours was not ideal. </p>
<p>P.S.s: </p>
<p>... Big hug and a photo with the woman in the mall store downstairs, for Riku of course! </p>
<p>... and last night, while tucking Riku in, he playfully went through our now "traditional" morning routine... pulling aside the curtain to the pitch black night, saying "It's light outside! Good morning! Time to get up!" </p>
<p>Riku's weight... 13 kilos... 28 1/2 pounds</p>
