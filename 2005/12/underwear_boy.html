								<h2>Underwear Boy!</h2>
								<p>Today started off a little differently than usual. Instead of going out into the dining/living room soon after waking, Riku decided to bring the toys into our room! He was awake at 7 a.m. and told me "Don't move". It started with just the tool box but I made the mistake of choosing to play cars which meant two more containers had to come in. Then came his car, the container of blocks, and last, but not least, the kitchen sink... really! His entire little kitchen was soon sitting beside the bed, with everything else neatly piled on top of the bed. </p>
<p>I was cold and suggested moving into the other room; his response "Oh, I sorry, here's a blanket", pulling the duvet over my feet. I gave in and had a lovely time; Riku made me a wonderful breakfast of bread "Toast? Oh, I sorry, I not have toaster, have to buy one", egg "How you like it? Oh, poached, okay, I cook it in water", and tomatoes. He gave me the pepper, after choosing it from a set of four, by seeing all the Ps on the container. We had a proper place setting too, of plates, a knife and fork, and cups. </p>
<p>He did a great job on my hot chocolate too, mixing the whole pretend works thoroughly with a spoon and then "You like cream on your hot chocolate?" making sounds of the machine as he squirted it on. What a great little cook he is. </p>
<p>I am sure we were in there for a good hour, interacting with zebra and dog, feeding them too, and finally coming out into the warmer room. The floor is heated in main room and on such a cold day that made a huge difference. </p>
<p>We had a quiet day at home. Riku has developed a little cold and his cough seems worse when he is first down for his nap or nighttime sleep, so a day inside on this cold day made sense. For the first time since I arrived, he didn't have a great appetite for breakfast. Akane made us a delicious egg, cheese, and tomato scramble with thick whole grain toast but Riku didn't eat any of it, just a few "O"s earlier and a mandarin. Akane and Bryn went downstairs for underwear for Riku and came back just as Riku was finishing his lunch. </p>
<p>He certainly made up for the morning slack, with a huge meal of oatmeal, strawberries, toast and soy milk! His tummy was so round we wondered how he could walk about. We kept him awake until 1 p.m., a little later than was ideal, since he naps at school at 2 p.m. and we are trying to make that adjustment a little easier for him. Of course, he was asleep very quickly and shortly after that Akane and Bryn headed downstairs for groceries and underwear, or so we thought. </p>
<p>Riku slept so well, and only wakened once at the almost-always forty minute mark. After that he slept for a total of two hours and forty-five minutes. I was on my own and whipped through more emails than ever at one time since arriving. It was great and I was completely caught up for the second time this trip. Of course they keep arriving but that's fine; I love to get my mail in each day and to keep in touch. </p>
<p>Once Riku awoke I turned off the computer and we played and played and played. </p>
<p>First though, after his snack I had taken his diaper off to encourage a trip to the bathroom (he had already urinated). He was chilly and so I pulled on a pair of pants and he commented "that feel funny". I remembered that he now had underwear, so pulled a pair of those on him; he was delighted and told me a little later he had to urinate! , </p>
<p>Riku had lots of energy for continuing with an airplane adventure started by his Daddy earlier. He had wrapped the duvet into a long cylindrical shape, the folded his two small futon and base for wings. We spent a good hour on this nice soft plane, with Riku taking the pilot's seat, flying us through thunder and clouds and big accidents and crashes (which Brent miraculously saved us from!) and me being a perfectly obedient passenger. </p>
<p>Riku is quite the little bossy boy these days, and I was told to do up my seat belt, to sit back, to not leave the plane to go to the bathroom, and was also put in charge of his dog, who apparently was hungry, frightened, and tired, and needed comfort or food from me regularly. I did get to be the pilot at one point, but it only lasted about three minutes as I wasn't doing something right and got shifted back into my seat again. What a fun time we had! I really wish we had a video recorder set up for some of these games as he is just so entertaining. </p>
<p>We both chatted with Doug a little bit on Skype about his upcoming trip to Toronto, leaving on Monday his time, Tuesday ours. </p>
<p>At 5:30 Riku's parents came home, having eaten a nice lunch out after taking a train to a nearby shopping centre. They are looking for a few extra gifts for Riku for Christmas and this seemed a good opportunity. It worked for Riku and me too. They brought me home an egg salad sandwich, which I ate immediately, having forgotten to eat lunch after our late breakfast, and then Riku had noodle soup, toast, 2 oranges, and banana milk gelato for dessert. </p>
<p>School tomorrow, so after some floor time with his dad, I got him into a warm bath for some wind-down time, and had him tucked into bed and asleep at 7:45. </p>
<p>Both computers were busy for most of the evening, so I got into my PJs, washed so I was ready when Riku called out, and wrote two letters... one to Tay, who is now living in Everett, Washington, and one to Neal. Then I knitted for an hour on Candy's scarf, now on the third try (I accidently pulled the stitches off a few nights ago! and messed up somehow one tired night as well), and had just started on a few emails on  Bryn's computer when Riku woke up coughing hard and crying. </p>
<p>Bryn went in with him, but Bryn is on the end of a cough problem himself, so I went off to bed about 10:45. There may be a baby here tomorrow, if Akane is right about the doctor not wanting her to wait much longer for Mirei to be born.... more sleep is good at this point. </p>
<p>p.s. At one point after dinner, Riku looked as though he was ready to have a BM in his underwear. Akane caught him just in time, his dad sat on the floor of the bathroom reading to him but it was all in vain. We were surprised that he would not tell us, when wearing diapers but I guess he is not quite ready for this. Bare bottoms might be best for a bit longer...</p>
