								<h2>No Baby Yet...</h2>
								<p>Well, despite our positive thoughts yesterday about Mirei arriving on Uncle Frank's birthday, she decided to remain where she is. Bryn says Akane has just made her little abode too comfortable and she has decided not to relocate quite yet. We just took some photos of Akane, so perhaps that will get things moving; she certainly looks more than ready for this baby to get a move on. </p>
<p>Today was a school day for Riku. He had a great couple of hours at home before leaving, partly due to his almost eleven hours of sleep last night. He was rested and happy and ate a big breakfast, and went off with his daddy to school at 9:05. Bryn said he was fine until they were in sight of the school before he started protesting his fate, but Bryn knew he would be fine once he got in there. Sure enough, when we arrived to pick him up at 5 p.m. he was in no rush to leave, which was also true of the last two times he was there. He did cry for a bit both then and at naptime, and was coughing a bit too, but we hope both these things will get better over the next while. Riku's next day there will be Friday, three days from now. </p>
<p>Akane puttered about again today, sweeping the floors and tidying up Riku's kitchen and play area. I read and knit but didn't have much computer time until later in the afternoon, and then wrote long emails to both Uncle Frank and Zoe. Nice to have the time to write them before too long has passed by; otherwise I forget what I have already written. </p>
<p>Bryn and I decided to go off to do a bit of shopping in a big plaza not too far away. It is at a main train station called Tennoji which I have not been to before, except as a transfer point on the trains. Bryn has a bit of a cold and is under the weather, but we poked around trying to find a 100 yen store Akane had been to the other day. We found it with a phone call to Akane, who had decided to stay close to home today. We also wandered about for a while checking out a few other stores and found some silverware for the children, some great cards, and a couple of plastic travel items for me. Caught the express train at 4:30 to get back for Riku's pickup at school. </p>
<p>It was very cold and windy all day; the sun was shining but it was still bone-chillingly cold out in the open. We came right home with Riku, who was happy to be surrounded by his toys. After a snack of rice crackers and some tiny delicious tomatoes, he got busy taking all of the tiny decorations off the advent tree and putting them all back on again. </p>
<p>Akane and I earlier in the day had cleared some pottery and dried flower arrangements off a table in the tatami room, and have made it into our holiday area. It now has the decorated small evergreen on the table, along with the Advent tree and the tiny house that Tomoha gave to Riku for Christmas on Saturday. A little wicker stand holds the snowman Mrs. Goda sent along with the tree, the first Christmas card to arrive, from Uncle Frank. It now feels a little more like Christmas and I wish Kelly were here to remind me of the words to some of the songs I would like to teach Riku, such as "Must Be Santa" and even more obvious ones I should know. </p>
<p>For instance, what is the last line of the first verse for "Christmas time is coming" repeated three times? Any help would be greatly appreciated as Riku is singing everything he hears and I had better get it right before it's in his head. While he was playing tonight after dinner he was really working hard to remember all the lines in "Santa Claus is coming to town". I know this one, thank goodness. </p>
<p>I did a little emailing while Riku played happily with his toys, with his mom lying nearby on the futon. Bryn started dinner, as we had decided we were going to have the "Lynne and Gail" special... boiled potatoes, cut into chunks in a bowl, topped with a hard boiled egg, freshly boiled and hot, and a nice knob of butter and pepper. Just lately I have started adding something green to it, for a healthier meal, which tonight was steamed broccoli. Bryn also peeled some crab legs Mrs. Goda had sent over. All I did was cook the broccoli, after Bryn had prepared it. </p>
<p>I set the table for four, we turned off the light over the table, and we all sat down together to eat at the same time. Usually this does not happen here, as we all eat different things at different times, or at least Riku and I do. Akane and Bryn often eat later in the evening, as they piece at bits during the afternoons. So, this was a real treat and we all enjoyed it. </p>
<p>Riku ate so very well, including a few bites of crab, drank a big cup of plain soy milk (he always has a glass of chocolate soy at breakfast), and while eating his dessert sang Japanese nursery songs with his Mommy, complete with actions. I wish I had had my movie camera here with me as it was so very cute. Bryn joined in on one of them too. Riku is so animated when he sings that he is a joy to watch.<br />
We all commented on how rounded he is getting, looking more grown-up as a result of it. </p>
<p>Playtime followed dinner, and while I tidied up, he joined his parents on the futon. Bryn built him a plane from Riku's tool kit, and by the time he had finished it, Riku had moved all of his toys, including the kitchen sink!, to the edge of the tatami room. He wanted "all my toys, many things" right there and they have been left there untouched for tomorrow morning. Tucked Riku in at 8:15 and left the room at 8:25. </p>
<p>While I was doing this, Akane and Bryn faced the nasty cold weather to venture out for a forty minute round trip walk out for gelato. It has been six days since we've had any and Bryn felt we really needed to get back to it. I agreed. Apparently it was so windy and cold that Akane begged to go back, but once they turned the corner it was much better, they shared a delicious chestnut gelato there (this will be my next cup), and brought home two containers for me to choose from, a raspberry cream and a chocolate. I was in a chocolate mood but the other was certainly appealing looking. Mine was just delicious, so creamy, rich, and chocolately, and Bryn insisted on saving me some calories and having a few bites of it too. </p>
<p>Bryn off to bed at 10 p.m. Riku awoke a few minutes ago crying out loudly and refusing to be comforted. He finally settled down and I told him his mommy would come in and snuggle him. I think he needs this extra time with her right now, as we hope that soon she will be off to the clinic having this baby. I'm sure Riku is going to suffer somewhat with that sitution as they have never been apart for more than two days and just one night. </p>
<p>I'll be off to bed shortly just in case Mirei decides tonight is the night. Bryn told me last night that if it does happen at night, I will be going to the clinic with Akane at her request. I am relieved that I will not miss the birth of this child... and now just hope she arrives very soon.  </p>
<p>I shall close off with a message on a wedding card I saw in one of the stores today: "Congratulations on your marriage. I celebrate that the great partner who catches all you was able to be encountered from the bottom of my heart. With my love and very wishes for today and for the future."</p>
