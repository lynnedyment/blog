								<h2>Monday... an In the House with Riku Day</h2>
								<p>Riku awoke in great spirits this morning, at 7 a.m., despite having a hot little body burning with fever up until about 5 a.m. He was happy to lie there for a bit, chatting to me and to his "dog", and then up we got. I expected it to be later and to find both Akane and Bryn awake, but they were snuggled in for just a few minutes longer. </p>
<p>Riku was hungry and had a big bowl of dry "O"s, a mandarin orange, and some juice. He played with Play-Doh and watched a children's TV program while I showered. Akane told us it was a very cold day out there today; they were even predicting snow! We bundled up, as Akane is off to see her doctor later on and to run some errands. Riku and I planned to spend the day at home. </p>
<p>We were lucky enough to do a little Skyping with Bryant and Kelly, and a tiny bit with Bryn as well. They are keeping their new little dog for a bit longer to see if she will look too obviously part bull terrier or not. Riku said hello to Bry' and Auntie Kelly; Gregg told me that Caillie had made a remarkable recovery from her pneumonia, diagnosed last Friday, and that I would be there for the annual sugar cookie gathering after all this year, as the children aren't out of school until the 23rd! I called Doug briefly as well, but we didn't have too much time before we had to get going. Nice to hear all these familiar voices though; I can't wait to talk to Amelia and see if she is going to feel too shy talking to a computer. I must get Doug to tell her about putting a photo up next to the name, as it does seem to make it easier for Riku to see who he is talking to. When he's at my house he can see Auntie Candy, or Gail, or Kelly. I like it too. </p>
<p>Akane and I were out the door with him at 9:25 to get to the nearby clinic to see a pediatrician... a female, and very popular. Riku has seen her once before, to have a check-up for his school enrollment, and Akane had liked her very much. The place was packed to the rafters with sick children and their mommies; runny noses and coughs seemed to be the main symptoms, although there were two very sick little ones waiting to be seen to. Riku seemed well in comparison to most of them, but after an hour and twenty minutes of waiting he started to show the symptoms of not being well too. He lost interest in the toys and didn't want anyone strange to smile at him. Thank goodness we were seen shortly after that. </p>
<p>I liked the doctor very much; she runs her office very professionally, and was thorough and friendly. Riku had started saying he didn't want to see the doctor and wanted to go home, but once he saw her stethoscope, decided it was perhaps an interesting place to be. He smiled at her as she put it in various places on his front chest, and then as he expected, on his back too. She had him stick his tongue out and say "ah", albeit a very small "ah" and drew a little picture for us of his red and infected throat. His chest is clear, thank goodness, despite his infrequent but always-there cough these days, and his ears are clear as well. She sent us home with an antibiotic containing a decongestant as well, and some suppositories for fever, which I hope we won't have to use. They are for a very high fever of over 39 degrees; Akane and Bryn bought a thermometer tonight so we can check if need be. </p>
<p>It was bloody cold out for certain. I wore my long navy blue wool coat with the long scarf Bruni sent for Riku, and we bundled him up in his winter jacket, a hat and the hood all tied together with a scarf. He still buried his head in my shoulder on the eight minute walk over and back. </p>
<p>Ayako had picked Akane up at the clinic, and as soon as we got in I made Riku his lunch. He was very specific... "toast and bacon, no egg" and he ate every bite of it, as well as polishing off his "O's" and drinking lots of juice. He was to have his medicine after his meal, so I gave that to him and within twenty minutes, after doing a wonderful drawing, it was obviously nap<br />
time, an early one at 12:30. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the phone rang at 1 p.m. and startled him and it took a bit to get him asleep again. By this time the fever had returned, and it was hard for him to settle in immediately. I lay with him for a bit, gave him some water, and finally he went back to sleep for another hour and a half, waking slowly with the fever down and happy to be up and playing. He asked for some noodles and I made him a big bowl of udon noodles in soy broth, with spinach, carrots, and mushrooms all finely diced. He ate more than I expected him to so his appetite is still good, a great sign. </p>
<p>Bryn left at 2 p.m. to join Akane for some errands downtown, and Riku and I spent a happy afternoon together with more Play-Doh, drawing, snacks and a bit of TV, although except for a brief segment on animals there was nothing for him to watch. By the time his parents arrived home Riku was feeling almost completely normal, his happy self making an appearance, and ready for some balloon playing with his dad and with me. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn went out for groceries within an hour of arriving home; I fed Riku more snacks, we played with the tools in his toolbox, and soon Akane and Bryn were home with us.  </p>
<p>Akane had ordered a DVD for Riku on "Ultraman", a movie made in Japan back in 1972. Riku has a few of the newly released action figures and likes them so was quite interested in seeing him in action. It's violent in many places, with guns and fights, but Riku sat on my lap making lots of comments and asking questions. We talked about how it was like Hallowe'en and the men were in costumes, especially the big scary ones. </p>
<p>Riku ate a half bowl of porridge for dinner, half of a banana, another Fig Newton which was a hit this afternoon, and did some more drawing. I am so amazed at watching this little boy intent on his art. He sits so nicely, with his back straight, having laid all of his pencil boxes neatly around him... two sets from Akane and one from his Baa-ba. He chooses one, uses it, places it on his left side neatly alongside the others already used, and continues in this fashion until he has used them all. At least that is how it went both times today and I took photos of both of his "pieces". </p>
<p>Within a half hour of having his medicine, Riku was lagging, and so his Daddy brushed his teeth and read "Small Pig" to him in bed. I followed with one "Nicky" book, and he took a little longer than last night to fall asleep. Unfortunately, if he coughs it really disturbs him and looks as though it hurts him to do so. Perhaps it hurts his throat... </p>
<p>I called Kei tonight to cancel our plans for meeting in the park tomorrow; it would be too cold to spend much time with the children there anyway, even if Riku were well. We have plans to meet on Thursday, and perhaps we will all meet Kei's husband too, who is off work that day. </p>
<p>I did some emailing, wrote this blog up, worked on some knitting off and on during the day, and somehow it all flew by too quickly. I must get out to the gelato place soon, although it is not that appealing when it is so cold! I can hear the wind blowing madly outside as I write this... brrrr.</p>
