								<h2>Sunny and Warmer... But Still no Mirei!</h2>
								<p>Riku awoke at 7:15 with giggles today, staying in bed again, pretending there was a monster coming in the door, and hiding our books and my watch under the covers with us. What a lovely way to start a day! </p>
<p>Bryn was up working hard when Riku wandered into the dining room. I prepared his first breakfast of "O"s, an orange, and chocolate soy milk, checked my email, and got into the shower first. </p>
<p>It was a sunny and bright day, and I wasn't sure how cold it was, but called Kei to see if she and Tomoha could meet us at the park at 10 a.m. Tomoha was still sleeping but she planned to waken her to make sure she would nap this afternoon. She called later to say they would meet us at 11 a.m. Riku polished off his now routine "second breakfast" of a poached egg on toast (he watched me cook it so knows that it is cooked in boiling water), two pieces of his "bacon", and plain soy milk.</p>
<p>What a fun morning this was, as there were so many familiar faces there... the two women with their dogs, a woman with a dog named Riku(!), our old friend the "dog man" (I got his name and address and as soon as Akane translates it for me I shall stop referring to him as the "dog man" (except in parentheses to remind you who it is!), and a mom we met in May, named Noriko, and her daughter Yui. This is the woman who gave me ointment for Riku's mosquito bites and later on wrote a wee note to me which Kei put in one of her letters for me. I didn't recognize them at first as Yui has grown much taller and her mom was wearing a sun hat the last time I saw her. </p>
<p>I had a chat with the dog man with some translation help from both Kei and Noriko and learned that he had indeed been mountain climbing for one month. I was so lucky to see him again, and he smiled so nicely at  Riku. This time I asked Kei to take a photo of me with him, for which I got thanked several times. Now I can mail him a photo; I took one of him alone... well, with his dogs, too. </p>
<p>The three children played very well together, collecting stones and sticks and wandering down some steps into a more desolate looking area. Some children from Riku's school were out playing, and he told me several times he was not going to school. At one point, after reassuring him once again that he was not going today, but would be going tomorrow he looked at me and said, very seriously, "tomorrow I am going to the doctor." Nice try, Riku! </p>
<p>Riku's vocabulary and language skills have changed so much, so rapidly, that I realized yesterday that talking with him now is just like talking with an adult. He makes perfect sense, can make himself understood 99.9% of the time, knows how to make jokes, and tease, and cajole, and express his anger (not always in an acceptable adult way, but he's getting there), and make it clear when he is hungry, when he has had enough, and how he wants his dessert despite being full of noodles. </p>
<p>Sitting on the futon yesterday, he said "Hmm, I wonder what Daddy is doing? Hmm, maybe nothing I guess. I can't hear him." Also last night he was watching a cooking segment on a children's TV show; they were cooking meat and he asked if I would like that dinner. I said "no", as I didn't eat meat. Riku replied: "I eat meat. I also eat crab. I eat lobster too... and then after a long pause, and a furrowed brow, he said "... but I don't like sea stars. They too crunchy" and then nodding and shaking his head with real certainty he repeated, "They too crunchy. Riku not like too crunchy." Akane laughed out loud when she heard this as of course he has never tasted a sea star and never will. He did eat octopus at dinner the other night, and salmon roe, so I suppose there was no reason for him to think one wouldn't eat a sea star too. </p>
<p>We came home to a delicious homemade lunch, fried rice with lots of veggies, prepared for us by Akane before going out with her sister.<br />
Riku had his with a few fresh tomatoes, and then I tucked him right into bed for his nap. He slept for only forty-five minutes, although it was partly my fault. I lay down beside him for a minute, and he immediately rolled over and put his face right next to mine, with wide eyes staring at me. I couldn't help but smile, and pulled my face down lower to hide it. He of course knew something was up and so pulled his face down to see mine; I was grinning even wider by now, so when he came down even lower I couldn't help but laugh. I started out snickering, and as he realized what was going on, he started laughing and trying to see me. Finally we both burst out laughing and that was the end of nap time! </p>
<p>Bryn was finished work, so he agreed to walk to Diamond City with us. We hoped Riku would nap, and he almost did, though not quite, but enjoyed the walk and the sights along the way. Bryn was stopping to take photos for his Japanese Web site, so it took us forty minutes to walk there. It was quite cool when we started out, but of course we were fine once we started moving. </p>
<p>Riku was happy to see the second floor toy space again as we had gone several times in May, but it was Bryn's first time there. Riku was obviously tired, and there weren't quite so many toys available, because of Christmas I suppose, so we didn't spend very long there. Perhaps we will get back again. Bryn found a free Atomu (Astroboy) stroller for Riku after he had a cup of hot chocolate from Starbucks; does he love his whipped cream! He's his Nana's boy.  </p>
<p>We left for home at 5 p.m. I was afraid he would fall asleep and he almost did, but a snack bag kept him going. We arrived home at 5:30; tomorrow is school for Riku so I want him in bed early after a relaxed evening. Porridge for dinner, toast and tomatoes, and two cups of plain soymilk which he seems to be enjoying a lot right now. He had a nice long splashy bath with a hair wash first, and then he and Bryn crashed cars for a bit before tuck-in at 7:30. I was out the door within ten minutes.</p>
<p>I spent the evening knitting, and going in and out to Riku after 10  p.m. (he was really snuffly), finally giving in and joining him at 11 p.m. </p>
<p>p.s. I did mean to say in yesterday's blog that the "pool" Riku fell into held about eight inches of water at its deepest. And while we were poking about in it today, pushing leaves back and forth, a very small child tripped into it!</p>
