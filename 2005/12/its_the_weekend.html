								<h2>"It's the Weekend!"</h2>
								<p>Riku and I both woke up this morning at 6:50; he is so sweet in the mornings when he first awakens. He rolls over and puts his hands on my face and smiles at me, until I say "good morning". Then he starts to chat, and rolls over me to get whatever book we read the night before. Pulling the curtain aside he waits for me to say "too bright!" at which point he giggles and then we start to read. </p>
<p>Bryn was working at the dining room table when we got up at 7:10 or so. He asked Riku, "Is today a school day?" to which Riku replied "It's the weekend" and sure enough, it is. Riku started off his day with Play-Doh, making little bits of it with a plastic knife, and poking holes into it with a tiny chopstick and a wooden dowel. His parents are not keen about this activity since it lands on the upholstered chairs but he is such a fan of it. We've decided we need to cover the chair or make it disappear until we are back in SF. </p>
<p>It has been three full days for Riku without a BM, unheard of for this boy, so I was determined it was going to happen today. While he was playing I served up a full mandarin orange, a slice of whole wheat toast, and a cup of veggie/fruit juice. This seemed to do the trick, as Riku disappeared into the bedroom and shut the door. Bryn decided we wouldn't suggest the toilet this morning, as we think this discouraged activity last night. (I am trying to be discreet here about a personal topic!). Alas, it was not a successful venture, and he joined us again a few minutes later. A few more bites of toast and ten minutes later we were all cheering his success. Whew! </p>
<p>Kei, the gal I met here in May, had been in touch with Akane yesterday via computer, too unsure of her English to talk to me on the phone. She and Tomoha were available for a visit in the park today for a meeting, and we were to be there at 10 a.m. I quickly showered, dressed, and fed Riku a few bites of the oatmeal I had asked Akane to prepare for him. </p>
<p>Despite his good sleep last night, Riku seemed not really rested, and was a bit grumbly about the meeting. Turned out that Tomoha was feeling quite shy, and that did the trick, as Riku was the one who warmed up first. They went over to the slide immediately and flew down a few times, and while Kei and I managed as best we could in her English and my no Japanese, they children played together. They climbed up the little hill, collected a few rocks, although Riku was not at all happy when she helped herself to one of his. He had them in a little baggie I found in my purse, and they were his!</p>
<p>I suggested at one point that we go to play in his school playground as it is open to the public today; there were lots of children there. However, Riku would have none of it; he said "no school, no playground" even though I assured him we were just going to play.  </p>
<p>We were eventually joined by an old acquaintance of Kei's, a classmate from kindergarten! and her three year old daughter. The three children played very well together in a little stand of trees, especially when the other mom chased them and saying "boo" when she came upon them. I had forgotten my camera! and whenever Kei tried to get a photo Riku up and left the scene. Both girls were determined to sit beside him at one point; it was funny to watch. Riku would wander off on his own and sit down on a little ledge. Tomoha would wander over and sit next to him and the other little girl on the other side of him. Up he would get and move on and it would start all over again. The visit went in spurts like this, with some running and fun, and then with Riku choosing not to play. It was chilly when the sun went behind the clouds and we both agreed we would meet again on Tuesday in the park. Tomoha was tired too, just as determined to hold on to the stick she took from Riku, as he was to have it. Eventually he traded her a bigger stick for it, and off we went waving goodbye.</p>
<p>Riku had an appointment to get his hair cut today at 3:30 p.m. It was the perfect plan; Riku would nap from approximately 12:30-2:30 and be awake long enough before the cut to not mind having his hair cut. Well.. the best laid plans, as they say... he ate his bowl of oatmeal for lunch, had another orange, and Akane and I left with a very tired boy for the 1:43 train. Riku fell asleep almost immediately on the train, just as we planned, and then woke up as soon as we got into the underground mall to go to the area we needed to get to. It was jam-packed with shoppers on every street, with lots of loud advertising, Christmas music being played at top volume, and no chance at all that Riku would sleep through it, without a good half hour nap under his belt first. It was frustrating as he was already overtired and we still had two hours before his appointment. </p>
<p>Akane walked me over to Uniglo to do some shopping I wanted to do, and she went to a quieter department store hoping that Riku would sleep for her then. But that plan failed too, and when she picked me up Riku was still awake. Bryn met us at 3 o'clock, after working until 2 p.m. (it's Friday in SF and a work day for him) and we headed over to the hairdressers after I fed Riku a yogurt and some snacks. Akane had given him two madeleines too, so he had a full tummy. </p>
<p>I thought the hair cut was going to be a total disaster as by this time it was so obvious that Riku was overtired. He was not a happy boy at the thought of getting his hair cut. Akane instructed the gal how she wanted it done, and they left saying they would be back in a half hour. Unfortunately, the appointment was stretched out a half hour late!, and I read to Riku in between bouts of his saying he didn't want to get his hair cut. </p>
<p>Thank goodness, it went well. I sat on the chair and got a cape on, with Riku on my lap with his towel and cape on too. Fortunately, looking at himself in the mirror is one of Riku's favourite things to do, so he managed to forget, for the most part, that he wasn't happy sitting there with hair falling into his mouth and eyes. I fed him bites of the tiny Toblerone bar I had been given on the plane and that was a diversion too. Akane and Bryn came in, watched the action for a few minutes, and after Bryn took a few photos of us, left for another walk around the area. Riku looked very handsome and like a regular little person with his new haircut. Akane had the gal cut his bangs a little bit shorter and Riku put up with yet more sitting very well. </p>
<p>Bryn suggested Akane and I go off to a big department store to buy the two little toys he had promised Riku for being co-operative with his cut, while he walk Riku around the block a few times to get him to sleep. Riku's eyes were almost closed when we parted, but a half hour later, there they appeared, Riku sitting straight up in his stroller appreciating night time in the big city. The crowds of people are unbelievable! Bryn says it has nothing to do with the approaching Christmas season, but just the fact that there are so many people in Japan, and apparently a lot of them like to shop! </p>
<p>We did our part too, with a new police car and a new fire department vehicle for Riku, and four delicious-looking custards, which I purchased from my first-this-trip visit to the most amazing food floors they have here. I really love wandering around in any of these massive bottom floor food emporia; they are beautifully set up with incredible breads, dessert displays... more than a half dozen of each, as well as fish and meat areas, prepared foods, hawkers calling out their specialties... I love it, and wish my sisters could see this just once in their lives. </p>
<p>We decided once we met that it was time to head straight home with this tired little boy. He went from being so good to not-so-good on the way home on the train, walking happily with me along a very long corridor filled with glass blocks with interesting collections of various things in them... glass bottles, undersea fantasies, etc. to throwing his hat on the floor on the train. He wanted me to carry him on this portion of the trip, after Bryn had carried him on his shoulders through the bright streets aboveground. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane stopped on the way home for a dinner at Mos' burgers, while Riku and I came upstairs immediately to get Riku fed and ready for bed. It didn't take long; I heated up a good-sized bowl of mac' and cheese with veg' for him, and he ate while we read about "Frog and Toad". Bryn and Akane returned with an order of fries for us to share, a small portion here in Japan. Riku ate only one so I had to finish the rest off on my own. Surprisingly, Riku did not want more than about a half dozen tiny bites of his plain custard so that was the rest of my dinner. </p>
<p>By 7:30 the light was out in Riku's room, after a story and an extra drink of water for Riku. I love his acceptance of his night time routine here; he has his teeth brushed after he's in his PJs, says goodnight to his parents, steps up on his bed, lies down (tonight he propped his face up with his elbow and told me to "try it", then got back up to turn on his sound machine and said "Oh, I forgot to turn off the light!". I reminded him it would be very hard to read his story in the dark so on it went again and he settled in beside me. He's a bit restless these nights settling down... pulling aside the curtain, sticking his leg up in the air, but it didn't last long tonight, and neither did I. I think he was asleep by 7:45 and I crept out of the room at 8:35, much to my surprise. I don't usually doze off while tucking a child in. </p>
<p>Tomorrow we are heading for Kyoto on the 8:55 train, so I will get to bed at a decent hour tonight in preparation for a long day out. Kyoto is about a one and a half hour train ride, and I wonder if a little boy will nap that early on the way there. </p>
<p>Notes: Susan sent sweet photos through of Amelia today and also installed Skype so that Amelia and I could chat a little bit... oh, and others too!</p>
