								<h2>A Long Walk.. .and More Gelato!</h2>
								<p>Riku and I slept late today, waking at 7:30, after a somewhat restless night for him. The coughing stopped soon after I crawled in with him,, but he had bad dreams, calling out not to wake him up, and just being a bit fretful. However, he woke a happy boy and ate a good breakfast immediately. </p>
<p>I showered quickly, had Akane show me how to use the washer; you put the clothes in, and the machine weighs it and decides how much water is required. It was a lovely sunny day and I hung my clothes up on the line outside on the balcony. I tidied up and came out to find that Akane had prepared breakfast for me, "bacon", scrambled eggs, and toast. Bryn had made me tea so it was a lovely breakfast. Usually, I have a piece of toast with peanut butter or a banana. </p>
<p>I decided to get out for some fresh air so Riku and I went off at 10:45 with Riku in the stroller. Usually he likes to walk until he's tired but today he asked to go right in; we took along his mittens as it seems quite cool out despite the sun. </p>
<p>I just wandered about the streets, going down interesting looking laneways, and enjoying the sun when it was out. Riku asked for his mittens and enjoyed the little "thumbs in the thumb hole, fingers altogether" song when I put them on him. They are attached to strings to keep them together, just like the ones my mom used to make for us. </p>
<p>Riku fell asleep about twenty minutes into our walk, which was great, as he was a little cranky at home. I enjoyed meandering about and found a little shop where the husband and wife were making and frying up tofu. I stopped to buy a package of three for 130 yen, and then asked if I could take their photo. They both smiled and the man gave me the "traditional" peace sign as I clicked the button. </p>
<p>I found a "shopping" street with banners at each end and wandered slowly along, looking at all the items for sale. Wandered into a big grocery store just checking out the prices, but the noise level was too high and I was afraid Riku would waken. </p>
<p>He napped for forty-five minutes and woke just past a large playground/park area we had passed on the last trip in May, but had never stopped in to explore. Initially, it looked quite boring with one slide and a few painted plaster animals to sit on, but Riku enjoyed the slide very much. It had large metal ribs, starting out low and ending with them much higher up, so by the time he reached the top he was standing at the end of the slide. He was the only child there and must have gone up and down about fifteen times. Then he discovered a ladder about halfway up on the side and used that way for a bit. From there we went on to a wonderful collection of dried leaves, laying by a fence. We walked through them, kicked them about and at each other, he tossed some over the fence and then made a huge pile of them. What a grand time he had! Of course, he also collected two perfect sticks which were part and parcel of the various activities. </p>
<p>Home for lunch, fried rice for Riku as well as a dish of kobocha squash, made by his mom. He ate some of both and then we coloured together for the first time. Riku has a colouring book and wanted me to do colour with him. Of course he always impressed me with his ability to not only stay inside the lines but to choose such great colours. The second page he started he would do one section in two colours and go on to the next section, choosing another colour combination. He looks quite intent on it while he's working and yet obviously enjoys it. </p>
<p>The afternoon went by in typical fashion, with Riku playing on his own for a bit, then we read a couple of stories, and he made tea and cake for me in his kitchen. </p>
<p>At 3 p.m. Bryn wondered if we would like to walk out for a gelato and of course Riku and I were both interested. It is the perfect little mid-afternoon walk, just fifteen minutes away with a reward at the end of it. Once again, the owner came out to tempt us with flavours he thinks we will enjoy. This time Bryn chose banana milk, which tasted just like fresh bananas... no artificial flavours at all, I had the wonderful coconut which he had made just a small container of, and Riku had of course his favourite strawberry, but gave away his frozen strawberry slices to his dad and to me. </p>
<p>It was just the three of us for dinner, so Bryn had leftovers, I made Riku oatmeal and toast for his dinner, and I didn't eat as I was full of gelato! </p>
<p>I warmed up the tub water for Riku and his dad sat with him while I did some emailing. He had lots of fun, and I bundled him up, put lots of cream on that warm little body, and had him tucked in at 7:05; at 7:30 I was typing away on the computer. However, Riku had a tough time settling down with his coughing spells; they were worse today than they have been, so it's off to the doctor for him tomorrow. He woke many times and I kept going in, settling him down in just a couple of minutes just to have it go on in another half hour or so. </p>
<p>Akane came home about 8 p.m. after a relaxing day out on her own. She kindly let me use her computer for the rest of the evening, as I was so far behind in both emails and my blog from last night. I managed to get that done and a few longer emails written before heading off to bed at 11:20. Riku had been sleeping soundly for the last two hours so I got more done than I expected to. Off I go...</p>
