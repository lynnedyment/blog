								<h2>A Bed for Mirei, Ultraman and... .</h2>
								<p>At 6:45 a.m. Riku woke me up saying there was a monster in our room! We quickly hid under the duvet, peeking out after a minute to see if we were safe. Riku wasn't sure so we took his golden dog in with us, just in case. Whew! Safe for another day. </p>
<p>We sat on the floor and played with his tool kit for quite a while. I managed to build a bridge that Riku's lowest fire engines could fit under and then we satisfied his "I'm hungry!" plea for food. </p>
<p>Today is the day that Mirei's crib was to be installed in the bedroom, so while I Skyped with Garry, Bryn and Riku got busy with the tools and put the crib together. Riku took his job seriously and helped carry parts and hold the rails for his dad. </p>
<p>Garry and I got caught up on lots of news and later on he sent on some wonderful photos of friends, both human and feline. He is off to Sri Lanka on Monday for the Christmas season, leaving the cold weather and snow behind in Montreal. </p>
<p>Bryn had agreed to go to the "ballroom" downstairs to see Riku roll about and bury himself in the balls, so we left here at 10:15. Riku put his own mittens on today; we were as delighted as he was, as he has only worn them twice now and had to fiddle a bit to get those thumbs in the thumb hole! </p>
<p>He had a great time again with the balls and slide, although it doesn't take too much exertion to bring on the coughing and tire him out. The big draw downstairs today though was the arrival of the action hero "Ultraman" dressed up as Santa(!), so after a half hour we headed downstairs to the main level. </p>
<p>While we were waiting for his arrival we stopped to see hello to the woman in the dress shop. Once again Riku got picked up for a big hug, and this visit also was given a lovely ornament, a finely woven filagree ball, quite small, with a ball made from old kimono cloth inside. She also gave him what we call, in North America, a dried Chinese lantern. After a quick trip to the bakery we joined the now crowded area in the mall to see "Ultraman". Riku was just thrilled and grinned from ear to ear while perched on Bryn's shoulders. </p>
<p>The woman standing next to me, and a woman beside her, were two of the women from the playground area on the second floor outside, where Riku and I spent so much time last May. It was such fun to see them again, and their children recognized me from their front row vantage point and smiled and waved until the hero caught their attention. </p>
<p>A nap for Riku followed right after his lunch; I read to him (the Caillou books are his favourites right now), and then Akane tucked in beside him for a one and a half hour sleep. We had planned to go to the gelato place today, but forgot about it until it was too late. Riku watched "The Incredibles" movie sitting on his dad's lap for the first half; he was slow to waken from his nap, but some more food and this snuggle helped him come 'round. </p>
<p>Bryn had bought Riku two sheets of plastic stencils at the "ballroom" shop, and Riku spent a good long while carefully tracing along the lines of the animals on one sheet and the dinosaurs on the other. While he was doing this, and when nothing out of the ordinary at all was going on, he piped up with "calm down, just calm down" which made us all laugh. Of course that just encouraged him and he managed to entertain us for a good long while by coming out with it now and then. He sounded exactly like his daddy, so there was no question where that came from!  </p>
<p>Dinner out with the Goda family was planned for this evening, so at 5:40 we left the apartment to walk to where Ayako works. She showed me her office and then Riku kept her busy trying to get him into the parking lot, and we were at the tofu restaurant at 6:30 to meet Akane's parents. They were about twenty minutes late, so Riku had lots of time to play with Ayako. It was a lovely spot and we had a big room to ourselves. The food was delicious and I took lots of photos of it and the company. It was something to see Riku eating salmon roe, deciding not to eat the tail of the ebi (shrimp), and asking before the meal if he could have sushi! I had agadashi tofu, yuba (boiled soy milk which forms a skin, and is scooped up and eaten after dipping in a sauce... delicious!, and a big green salad with crisp tofu "chips" which I crumbled into the salad. Tea, rice, and some soy pudding of Riku's which he not only shared with me, but fed to me every other bite! </p>
<p>Home at 8:45 and I tucked Riku in at 9:15 after he had a chance to look at a large calendar his Baa-ba had given him. I walked out at 9:30... email and blog time.</p>
