								<h2>Kyoto, the Hermitage Shisen-Do... and a Sick Boy</h2>
								<p>The plan for this morning was to take the 8:55 train to Kyoto. Riku had a good start as he awoke at 6:15, the earliest he has been awake since I arrived. I think he was too warm, as I had shut our window earlier this morning than usual. However, he was happy to just lie there quietly snuggling with me for another half hour, and then we got up. Bryn was already at the computer in the dining room, so while they had a little time together I popped right into the shower. I did check my email first, but didn't spend much time at it. </p>
<p>I wanted Riku to get rid of all the little hairs from his hair cut yesterday, but he didn't decide to join me in the shower until after I had already gotten out. However, I popped back in with him just to get his hair shampooed and the body hair free. We were quick at it though, as Akane too had to shower. </p>
<p>Riku ate some Os while playing on the floor with his daddy, plus some juice and a whole mandarin too. He was coughing a bit more this morning, in good spirits, although did say he would like to stay home and play. Tomorrow we shall do just that. Unfortunately, we missed the express train by one minute; Bryn was not happy about it, although the rainy grey day probably didn't help either. We ended up taking more trains but the advantage was that the last one was the first of the run so we had a guaranteed seat for the forty-five minutes to Kyoto. Before that last train we had time to stop for an "Egg McMuffin", the first I have had in a couple of years, and I enjoyed every bit of it. I had packed lots of snacks for our trip, plus some food for Riku, but hadn't eaten myself. </p>
<p>Riku was a bit out of sorts; it was obvious he was tired despite his nice early-to-bed night last night, and a good ten and a half hours of sleep, but he wanted me to hold him, and didn't want to go back in the stroller once he was out for a bite of breakfast. I was happy to hold him and once on the train he was asleep in my arms, in less than five minutes. The train was very crowded but Riku slept right through to the end of the line. It just wasn't long enough for his needs. </p>
<p>It was raining in Kyoto and we took a taxi to Shisen-Do temple, one of Akane's favourites in this city. Bryn carried Riku up the rough stone steps, and I parked the stroller at the top. After a few minutes Riku was willing to walk around for a bit, especially since there were puddles and some mud along the way. Bryn pointed out lots of interesting things to Riku... several lovely little waterways, a lovely stand of bamboo, a wooden bridge, and two ponds with fish in them. At one point, Bryn pointed out a loud clacking sound and asked Riku to find where it was coming from. He did so, after listening carefully, and found a hollowed out bamboo pole, filling with water, and then tipping onto a stone, carved out by millions of thuds of the end of the bamboo pole on it over the years.</p>
<p>This temple was built in the early 1500s and is a beautiful place. The gardens, even in the rain, were just lovely. A persimmon tree, bare except for some brilliant orange fruit, was set in the middle of a raked area, backed by mountains covered in fall foliage. We walked slowly from one spot to another and I took lots of photos. It was wonderful that Riku enjoyed it so much, as the rest of his day was not much fun for him. </p>
<p>As we were leaving Riku said to Bryn "Let's go home now". However, we were all hungry and ready for the tofu restaurant lunch that was planned for today. We took another cab, which Riku enjoyed very much, pointing out various things he noticed along the way, and then walked around for about twenty minutes trying to find this restaurant. It is just not meant to be; three years ago Bryn and I planned to go to it as well, and something came up and we had to change our mind. Ah well, one day... </p>
<p>Riku meanwhile was asking for noodles, so Akane managed to find us a nice, small local place where noodles were the main dish. Bryn and Akane chose a noodle and toful dish for me, Bryn's contained a well-known local fish, herring, and Akane had noodles with nori and we shared a small plate of tempura vegetables as well. I am not a fan of fish broth, and found Bryn's much too strong, but there was enough ginger in mine that it it was fishy, I didn't notice it. </p>
<p>Riku had changed his mind after eating a few noodles from both Akane's and my bowls, and instead ate some apple slices I had taken along, a half a container of yogurt, and orange juice, a drink he made clear he wanted. He also ate some "fish" crackers when we first sat down; he was obviously not feeling well at this point, he had a slight fever, and we were happy to have him sit with us and eat. By this stage he wanted only me to do anything with him... sit beside him, hold him while he ate, and accompany me to the bathroom too. Bryn decided we would head right home with him, while encouraging Akane to stay out and enjoy wandering around checking out the few things she had hoped to do today. </p>
<p>The rain had stopped so the walk to the train station was fine. Riku was happy to sit in the stroller and he was asleep five minutes after the train started. It was a forty-five minute trip, and another forty-five between waiting for the train home and getting to our station, Sakai-Shi.  </p>
<p>Riku was really burning up by the time we got in the house, and wanted nothing more than to snuggle up and lay quietly against me. He did tell me he was hungry though, and when Bryn asked what he wanted he came out with an egg, "bacon", toast and hot chocolate. He wasn't well enough to eat it all though; ate about half of the egg and toast, polished off the bacon and decided against the hot chocolate in favour of the veggie/fruit juice. He drank a lot of it, and it is a good thing, with the fever running.</p>
<p>At one point, I lay with him on the double futon in the tatami room, right next to where I sit typing in the dining room, and he was asleep within three minutes. He was whimpering, poor wee guy, but slept for a half hour or so. Up he got, climbed into a chair and watched some TV with his dad... a great show about children seeing how animals live in the forest, and just leaned in against him while I did some blogging. Riku also said he was hungry again, ate some of his "O"s cereal and drank lots of juice. </p>
<p>His fever got a little higher with his legs and arms quite hot, but now, at 9:30, Bryn says his arms and legs seem a touch on the cool side. His face, neck, and body are still warm, and I am prepared to give him a little bit of crushed Tylenol in the night if he is too uncomfortable. I would prefer not to, naturally, and let it run its course, knocking out whatever bug is making him sick. Akane came home about nine; she enjoyed her afternoon and evening out, which is wonderful, as there will soon be a little girl keeping her busy.  Both Akane and Riku will see their doctors tomorrow. Shall keep you all posted. I can hear him struggling a bit again, so shall close off for tonight.</p>
