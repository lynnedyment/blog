								<h2>From Toronto to Niagara Falls</h2>
								<p>Caillie and I both woke at 8:30 this morning, but lay in bed for another thirty-five minutes, talking, while I drew pictures and numbers on her back for her to guess. She always remembers I did this with my sisters when I was a child, and always asks me at least once a visit to do this with her as well. Caillie took a turn on my back too, but mostly she loves it for herself. We had to get up before doing any reading today, as the plan was to leave for the Falls as early as possible. </p>
<p>I showered immediately, packed up my bag, and did as much of the kitchen cleanup as I could... washing the big bowls and platters, getting rid of some of the bottles, and then doing my part of clearing out the fridge by eating a huge portion of watermelon and drinking a large quantity of the juice left over from the makings for watermelon margheritas! </p>
<p>Of course, leaving is always later than we had hoped for, and we finally left the house closer to 11 a.m. Traffic was fairly light and we made good time to the Falls, stopping first to eat at Harvey's, and then heading downtown to the aviary exhibit on River Road. A friend of Kelly's had told me last night how worthwhile it was to visit and it certainly was! We all enjoyed it so much and spent longer there than we had planned to; there were so many wonderful birds to see, on three levels. Bry' kept track of the ones we could identify and all four children went in to the enclosed pen holding the lorikeets, to feed them. Caillie and Myk' were both nervous and had the birds taken off their arms and hands before they had finished eating, but the boys both enjoyed it so much, even when they crawled up and around their necks. </p>
<p>We got to Uncle Frank's about 3:30 p.m. and there was little time for everyone to visit with UF. They did each play him a tune on the litttle organ and we spent a bit of time chatting and taking photos too. They went back to Toronto and I went in to unpack in my room. What a lovely surprise to find a bouquet of fresh flowers awaiting my arrival, and the photo of UF and me that I sent to him last week, now framed and displayed on the dresser. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank had a small flooding incident on Friday, having left the bathroom tap running while he was out of the house for a few hours. We plan to get busy with that job tomorrow, but sat and caught up on our news over a cup of tea in the kitchen. UF suggested dinner at Lina Linguine's, knowing how fond I am of it, but it was 6:30 by the time we thought about dinner, and instead we stayed in town and went to a Boston Pizza. It really hit the spot; we shared a mushroom and green olive pizza, a combination that Mom and AR had introduced me to many years ago. Yum! We both enjoyed it thoroughly. </p>
<p>We came back home for our tea and had it sitting in the damp rec' room. This is where the flood damage is... the ceiling and a very damp rug. We read the two papers, and I called Marie at almost 11 p.m. while UF finished up his paper. He heard me telling Marie about having bought a bottle of port last week, when out with two couples at a wine tasting tour, and the next thing I knew I was being handed a very generous glass of delicious port! I had told UF about the port last week, and he had thoughtfully picked up a bottle for us to share. </p>
<p>We stayed up far too late, turning in at 1:30 a.m.! It's lovely to be "home" again.</p>
