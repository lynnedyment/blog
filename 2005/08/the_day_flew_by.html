								<h2>The Day Flew By!</h2>
								<p>It was a busy, busy, day today although not quite as productive as I thought I would be. Doug is in Seattle and I don't have Riku today. Despite having the house to myself, or perhaps because I had the house to myself, I chatted with all three of my sisters today. Beth and I spoke on Skype for quite a while, and then Gail came on after Beth left. I dashed up to shower, made the bed, and made my breakfast... "bacon", an egg and a thick piece of toast made with bread Bryn brought over on Sunday morning. It is thick enough that I can cut it in half and still have my two pieces of toast... yummy.</p>
<p>Candy called just as I put my hot chocolate on the table, along with the paper. Our cordless phones are not working well right now, so I started chatting in the kitchen while eating my breakfast, changed to the bedroom phone upstairs, and ended up sitting on the floor in Riku's room. We hung up at exactly noon hour!</p>
<p>I quickly got busy, deciding to get the ironing out of the way. That done I answered a few emails, made room for our new indoor grill in the pots and pan cupboard, cooked up some rhubarb, and made banana bread for Akane, Bryn, and Riku.</p>
<p>Today in the mail I received a long chatty letter from Kei in Japan. I am surprised she didn't email, as we have exchanged emails, and now I wonder if I should respond to her via a handwritten note as well. I won't answer immediately and will think about this.</p>
<p>I sat upstairs in late afternoon with a cup of hot tea and a bowl of fruit salad, flicking through the tape of Oprah shows Doug taped for me last week. Only one was not a repeat which was just perfect for my break.</p>
<p>Kelly was on MSN for a bit; she has been ill with a nasty virus and is still not feeling great. She gave me the news that Hans has been offered a job with his old office... "Food and Agriculture" for the Liberal party. It may just last two years but it was good news; he will be out in the world again which is good for him, I think. Kelly asked if I would stay for the party they are having on Sunday afternoon, a crowd of 55 expected!. I will babysit for Gregg on Saturday night, as Kelly will be at a CM convention, and then will be there to help with prep' work on Sunday morning. She may drive me to the Falls on Monday and all four children would be with us, so that will be fun.</p>
<p>Chatted with Gail for a bit on Skype again; she and Tom are on their way out for a walk, I ate a perfect dinner for me... sauteed, pre- baked tofu, and a big mound of spinach lightly steamed on top of it, and then served with a nice generous slice of French goat cheese that I must use up before leaving. It was <strong>so</strong> good and I enjoyed every bite of it.</p>
<p>And then it was time to tackle the laundry room. I can't bear to come home to it, and it has been on my mind for a couple of weeks now. I worked away at it non-stop except for another little chat with Gail, back from a two hour walk. And now, I am happy to report, I have a very clean, tidy, and much better organized laundry room. Some of the children's toys are on a rolling rack with three shelves, which will keep them together and still handy for them, the paper, paint, and brushes are on the top of another rolling stand. I somehow managed to part with dozens of cleaning cloths; I am taking Flylady to heart and realizing that I really truly do not need four or five dozen rags. Off to the SPCA they will go tomorrow!</p>
<p>Riku called to say his usual goodnight, when his Daddy is there to make the call for him. It's the highlight of my day, especially on the days that I haven't seen him. Tonight he told me he was reading "Babar", although I thought he was saying bubbles in his soft little voice. After I told him that Babar wears clothes, he told me that his daddy and mommy did too... Babar's that is! And of course it ended with the sweetest thing of all. I say "goodnight sweetheart" and he says it back to me. And then comes "I love you" and he loves me too! A kiss goodnight ends the call, after "see you tomorrow!".</p>
<p>And I am off to bed... too late once again. It's almost 11:30 p.m. and I shall no doubt be awake at 6:30, after turning out the light at midnight.</p>
