								<h2>Pretty Pink!</h2>
								<p>I awoke earlier than usual today; guess my body has had enough of this sleeping-in business! I was downstairs and showered at 7:30 this morning, checking my email and starting the laundry, both ours and Akane's and Bryn's, which he dropped off yesterday. I also dashed off to the hospital with a card for the 9:30 a.m. pick-up; I had a card for the UK which had to be mailed asap. </p>
<p>Even though yesterday I had thoroughly watered the six thriving blooming pots of flowers that Susan planted a few weeks ago (they are looking full and gorgeous!), I noticed they needed another good soaking, so did that as soon as I got home. Then it was time to read the paper, while having a banana and my big mug of hot chocolate.</p>
<p>I decided I really did not want to be doing last week's ironing tomorrow, so went back upstairs to change the bedding and iron the five remaining shirts. Susan called while I was up there to see if Riku and I would like to join them at Ocean Beach today. It is very foggy over on that side of the city, but it was sunny here, so the chances were good that it was going to burn off later on. </p>
<p>Chatted with Bryn on IM for a bit; Akane and Riku had plans to go to the library in the early afternoon, and no doubt he would be napping in the stroller, after which it would be too late for me to take him to the beach. Doug and I planned to go to an author's reading tonight in San Mateo, so I would have to be back home by 6 p.m. So, we will have an Ocean Beach day tomorrow if the weather holds. It's often either foggy or windy over there, but we might be lucky. Riku could nap in the car while I read, with the ocean view... lovely! </p>
<p>It was time to get that pedicure I forgot to get on my birthday. Finishing the ironing seemed like a good reason to treat myself so I called and found out that it wasn't busy and I could just walk on in. Doug wanted to go to Safeway and Rainbow, he is the shopper in the family!, so he dropped me off, agreeing to pick me up in an hour. I was in for a very nice surprise! Susan had given me a gift certificate for what is reputedly the "hot" spot in the city to have a manicure/pedicure; it's called "Mani-Pedi" and is right here in Potrero Hill.  I thought the certificate was for a pedicure but it was also for a manicure and a special ten minute foot massage too. It was heavenly! They have vibrating chairs, with various settings and lots of People magazines to browse through. However, once it started I just lay back and enjoyed every minute of it. How I love, love, love having my feet massaged! I chose a nice bright, but not too bright!, pink for my toes, for a change. I usually go with something a little more subtle but I am off to San Diego soon, so decided to go for something different. Because it wasn't busy, I got to stay in that lovely moving lounging chair while the polish dried. My fingernails are tidied up and all one length now but I have clear polish on those... no point going overboard here! </p>
<p>After all that lovely relaxing time, I managed to get lots done during the rest of the day. Laundry took up a lot of time, I wrote a couple of notes, annotated some photos, and answered a lot of emails. And so went my day... nothing exciting happened... although we did have another piece of Bryn's cake, and I polished off the end of his pasta salad. I was very hungry when I got back from my "treatments". </p>
<p>I was still working on the laundry in the early evening, and so decided not to go to the reading with Doug after all. I have so many little jobs to do and they are just not getting done. Apparently I missed a great reading, and as the audience was small, missed a great informal chatty evening with the author and the small group that attended. It felt good though to get ahead of some of the jobs on my list, and I was more relaxed at the end of the evening than I would have been otherwise. I also got to IM with Kelly for a bit; she is home from the Manitoulin and on her own for four days! Gregg is away on business in Ottawa, and the children are with their grandparents. I might actually get to talk with my daughter this week! She didn't even know I was going to San Diego on Thursday... we are so out of touch these days, with too much going on in both of our houses. </p>
<p>It's 10:30 and I am off to fold another load of laundry (one more to go), before heading upstairs to get involved in one of my birthday books. Bryn is at ping pong tonight, so no good night phone call from my little guy...</p>
