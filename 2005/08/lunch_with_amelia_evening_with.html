								<h2>Lunch with Amelia, Evening with Ian</h2>
								<p>'twas another busy day, although it started it off in a leisurely fashion. I woke at 8 a.m. and got busy with emails and a blog entry, put it a load of laundry and sorted through a few envelopes of photos. Had eggs and toast for breakfast along with our half whole wheat Italian loaf, cleaned the stove, finished cleaning the fridge, cooked up some of last year's rhubard for UF's desserts, and tidied up the laundry room a bit. </p>
<p>Uncle Frank decided to drive me out to Amelia's and Jake's so that he could run some errands in the car on his own this afternoon. There was road construction going on Garner Road so we had to turn back and take the long way 'round to their house. Jake is working the chip wagon today but was kind enough to make up potato pancakes for our lunch today. They were just delicious... tender and tasty! and I ate four of them. We did have a glass of wine first and ate a lovely green salad while the pancakes were heating up. </p>
<p>Amy and I had a good long stretch of time to catch up on all our news.. our grandchildren, our children, and trips and plans for the next year. It was so relaxing sitting in their bright and cozy den, feet up, relaxed and happy to have the time together. Tea followed, and at 4:15 UF picked me up. He had had a hard time finding his way back to us as there was more work going on, but I had called the hairdresser and told her I would be late. </p>
<p>Arrived at Studio 54 at 4:30 and was finished at 5 p.m. Had a new stylist called Karla who did a very good job with the cut, although it is much shorter than I intended it being. UF picked me up</p>
