								<h2>Riku's Special Art... and Our Little Helper</h2>
								<p>IM'ing with Bryn today:</p>
<p>Lynne says:<br />
Riku napping... 10:30 a.m. on the dot</p>
<p>Lynne says:<br />
says Riku "I'm going to do art now. Special art. No touching. I'm working now"<br />
Lynne says:<br />
and he is indeed busy doing art<br />
Lynne says:<br />
"no touching the art. Special art. No touching, okay?"<br />
bryn says:<br />
wow!<br />
Lynne says:<br />
he just keeps saying over and over... "making special art. No touching, okay?"<br />
Lynne says:<br />
it's very cute...<br />
bryn says:<br />
he was drawing this morning, and didn't want me to draw on the sheet<br />
Lynne says:<br />
now saying "What shall we make? Maybe you would like a hat? Maybe you would like this art?"<br />
bryn says:<br />
usually we just draw together<br />
Lynne says:<br />
He is going on and on... typing away to try to get it all<br />
bryn says:<br />
adorable<br />
bryn says:<br />
first time he's said "making art"<br />
Lynne says:<br />
"Maybe draw a circle?"<br />
Lynne says:<br />
first time i have heard this too<br />
bryn says:<br />
like his overalls?<br />
Lynne says:<br />
oh yes, but I like overalls a lot... he is asking me to come and work on his little chair<br />
Lynne says:<br />
Riku LOVES his little table (we bought it for him at IKEA recently)<br />
bryn says:<br />
that's awesome</p>
<p>OK.. here is a another new one for me... in the car coming home after dropping off Akane, Riku was chattering away to himself and making rolling motions with his hands... very busy<br />
Lynne says:<br />
and then he said to me "Riku speaking Japanese"!<br />
Lynne says:<br />
I repeated it to him, asking "You are speaking Japanese?" and he said "yes, Riku speaking Japanese".<br />
bryn says:<br />
yeah, we kind of kid about that...<br />
bryn says:<br />
if he's talking gibberish, i'll sometimes say "are you speaking japanese?"</p>
<p>later still... </p>
<p>Lynne says:<br />
I'm fading fast here... off I go to tidy Riku's room. Today he helped me fold the two blankets he uses during his naps... he took one side and I took the other... he likes his room tidy.. interesting, but then so did you<br />
bryn says:<br />
he helped carry stuff up from the car<br />
Lynne says:<br />
Karyn said today that Riku looks so much like you! She thought it was his smile perhaps. Akane says more people are saying that too, although I see many of Akane's mannerisms in him lately<br />
bryn says:<br />
he carried the banana bread up.... wanted to participate<br />
Lynne says:<br />
he is a helper for sure...<br />
Lynne says:<br />
yes, that's what it is... he pulls up the chair to help cook, and today helped load up a bag with things for the baby!<br />
Lynne says:<br />
he is such a special little boy<br />
bryn says:<br />
i'm glad you think so!<br />
Lynne says:<br />
yeah, me and the universe!</p>
