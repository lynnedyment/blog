								<h2>Happy Birthday, Bryn</h2>
								<p>Thirty-seven years ago today I was in the Salvation Army Hospital in Ottawa, having just given birth to a beautiful baby boy. Gram was visiting me to take care of Kelly when I went into labour; Doug was on his way to Calgary on a business trip. My water broke in the late evening and at midnight I was getting into a cab, with Gram carefully walking me out on a cold and icy night. I worried about her all the way to the hospital; she was 68 years old that year, and strong and capable, but she didn't like ice any more than I did, and the driveway seemed long on that walk to the taxi. </p>
<p>At 2:13 a.m. Bryn was born, a beautiful 7 pound 13 ounce baby, with red fuzz on his lovely round head. I had such an easy delivery and the next morning was feeling energetic and missing Kelly terribly. I called home frequently that day and by day two Kelly was asking Gram "Mommy again?". She didn't see us until six days later and she was very excited about her baby brother. </p>
<p>Thirty-seven years later we broke San Francisco records for the hottest March 11th ever recorded, with ninety-one years of temperatures behind us. Bryn had a long day at work today and finally managed to get here just after 7 p.m. for his birthday celebration. Originally the plan was to have his favourite Japanese hot pot dish with vegetables and crab in broth, but it was far too hot to cook in their apartment and Akane happily agreed to come here instead for a simpler dinner of quiche, squash, corn, and carrot cake for dessert. </p>
<p>I met Akane and Riku on the block before our house; it was dark and Akane was carrying him. I went running towards them and Riku was down and running towards me calling out "Nana! Nana! Nana" in a very excited voice. He just loves running and racing at this stage. </p>
<p>Kelly and Gregg called from home quite late at their end, after possibly their last skiing trip of the season. Bryn spoke to each of the children and was amused when Bryn, obviously ready to hang up, said, "Well, I had better go now and get into my pajamas." </p>
<p>Gail called too, and she and Tom sang "Happy Birthday" to him as well. Bryn sits there grinning throughout all these songs in his honour... fun to see.   </p>
<p>Riku was delighted with the balloons hanging above the table, enjoyed spooning into his own slice of carrot cake, and looked just a little embarrassed, and then very pleased with the singing of "Happy Birthday", as though somehow it was all for him. Very sweet. He also blew out a candle on his own piece of cake, the first one he has blown out completely on his own, and very proud of himself too, as we all clapped. </p>
<p>We gave Bryn a heavy deep omelette pan, which will no doubt cook up mountains of home fries over the coming years, a gift certificate for a reading lamp for the bedroom, and money towards a family photo shoot to be taken soon, I hope. </p>
<p>Bryn has a test tomorrow for his Japanese language classes, so while I read to Riku, Akane made tea, and we all sat in the living room finishing up the night while cool air blew in through the front windows.</p>
