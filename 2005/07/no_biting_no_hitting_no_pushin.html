								<h2>No Biting, No Hitting, No Pushing, No Licking!</h2>
								<p>I woke this morning with a very sore shoulder; the kind that makes you wince when you turn your neck. I must have slept on it in a strange way, although was not aware of doing so in the night. That led to a low grade headache, so I started my day off with a particularly long and hot shower. </p>
<p>I answered some emails, sat and enjoyed my big mug of hot chocolate while reading the paper and then got to work on my paperwork. Bryn called to ask if Doug could help him out with the motor scooter he bought in Vietnam, with the intention of selling it here. Doug agreed to go over, and I agreed to have Riku while they worked on it. It is always so wonderful to see Riku's big smile, and he was ready to go right upstairs to the castle, farm, and blocks. Bryn had brought their laundry over as well; he started the first load and I continued on with it during the day. </p>
<p>Riku was obviously tired; I had come downstairs for some strawberries for him and when I went back up he was lying on his side on the carpet, holding onto one of the firemen figures, but not playing with it. He had a very loose and smelly BM, and seemed just slightly out of sorts, not like Riku at all. I called to see if I could put him down for a nap. Bryn said that was fine; ten minutes later Riku was sound asleep with "many animals!" and the ocean sound blocking out the neighbour's barking dog. He slept for an hour and a half. </p>
<p>Doug and I had plans to go to a double feature, but with my neck so sore I decided against it. I thought if I took a muscle relaxant I would sleep through the movies, and if I didn't I would sit there totally aware of holding my neck up and straight to see two movies. I decided instead to stay home and really work on my files and then perhaps get to the photo order as the last of the three packages came in this morning. </p>
<p>Ah, how plans change. Bryn asked if I would like Riku for an extra hour while he went home to do some work. He was off to play ping-pong at a club at 1:30 so would pick him up before then. At 1:35 he called to say that Akane wasn' t feeling well and would come over to work on the laundry and be here with Riku. Of course it is impossible for me to ignore Riku but he was happy to sit on the bed in his room playing with the wooden blocks, his cars, trucks, trains, etc. while his mommy watched him, and then they both sat at the table drawing. Riku is amazing! First he drew some circles and coloured them in carefully, and then Akane drew a flower, an orange, and a strawberry. Riku took a marker and very meticulously filled them in, hardly moving outside the lines at all! It would have been hard to believe if I hadn't seen it myself. He had such a look of concentration on his face as he did this; a half hour later he scribbled all over the page but you can still see his previous careful work. Wow! </p>
<p>Akane folded the laundry as I took it in to her in the bedroom, which allowed me to continue work on the stack in the dining room. I have been throwing out lots of paper and the recycling bin will be full this week. What takes me so long with this process is that I clip out so many different things of interest to me, as I go through all my magazines and the paper. I end up with recipes, interesting sounding books for the various children and for me, health tips with herbs, vitamins, food, etc., all the financial statements that come in (and they have been piling up since before Kelly's visit with the children in March!), photos from others, so many letters to answer, cards to send out, interesting websites to add to my list, articles to pass on to mostly Susan, but also Kelly or my sisters, and this time paraphernalia from Japan and the trip from Vancouver to Las Vegas, and back to SF. And then there are the photos! ... and interesting sounding restaurants in the Bay area (not that we are going out to eat much these days, but one day... ), and crafts for children... and on and on it goes. At least I have the good sense to recognize that I am not going to make the potato chip cookies or the double chocolate chip cookies so tossed the recipes out for those; I must have been very hungry when I went through that particular magazine. I got lots done, despite my favourite little diversion in the house. </p>
<p>Bryn came by at 3 p.m. and sat down to play Sudoku for a bit with Akane. Riku and I had some time together on the sofa to read several books; a cuddle is always a pleasure. I made Akane and Bryn a toasted tomato sandwich before they left for home at 4:30, and after they left made a cup of tea, sat and read a magazine. </p>
<p>I had offered to babysit Amelia early tonight so that Susan and Kevin could get out to an early dinner at "Suppenkuche" (our gift to Kevin for his birthday in March and one of his favourite places to eat in the city)followed by a movie. Doug had gone to the movies, which were out at 5:15, and handily, Kevin was in the neighbourhood with Amelia, at a baby shower. He came by to pick me up just as I finished my tea. I sat with Amelia in the back seat of the car and we chatted about her day; she had escaped from an enthusiastic puppy at the shower by going into his kennel and shutting the door! </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin left the house about 5:30 and I fed Amelia immediately. She was a hungry girl and ate every bite of her mac' and cheese, sliced carrots, a spinach/brown rice dish and then amazingly, blue corn chips dipped into a delicious home made guacamole, licking it off the chip and redipping! It was very funny to see, as she really enjoyed the whole process. Dessert was most of the fruit that Susan had put out for her and lots of water. </p>
<p>Doug played with her in the living room while I ran her bath. Amelia is so smart and knows that tuck-in follows her tub so she wasn't at all anxious to stop playing with Doug. They had been reading, then when I went she clung to his neck and hung on for dear life! Boy, talk about feeling like the Grinch! </p>
<p>Amelia enjoys her tub though and she had a nice warm relaxing time with her two babies; after washing Amelia's hair she had me pretend to wash both babies' hair too. I took a darling photo of her (below). </p>
<p>After her PJs were on, Amelia ran in to see Doug again (of course!) and had both of us lifting our legs in the air from our sitting position on the sofa. She would raise Doug's leg up as best she could, groaning away, and then doing the same with his other leg, before commanding me to do the same. What a girl! At one point, Doug lifted her high in the air holding on to her with his lower legs, which she quite enjoyed, wanting him to do it over and over again. </p>
<p>At 7:30 it was time for a little girl to go to bed. She whimpered a little bit, but we read two stories on her chair, had some snuggle time with songs, and she was a heavy tired girl when I put her in the crib. Amelia did stand up when I stopped stroking her back and singing; I sang another couple of songs until she was drifting and left the room. Immediately, with the creaking floorboard outside her room, she awoke and back in I went. This time I told her that it was sleepy time, that she was to stay lying down, with her monkey and her horse, and left. </p>
<p>I was walking down the hall to the living room when she cried out, but I kept walking until I was with Doug. He had a movie all set up for us, and I stood waiting to hear how Amelia was .... and there wasn't a peep! Amazing when this happens! We watched a DVD Susan and Kevin had rented "Hotel Rwanda" which was not a movie I could sleep through; it was quite grueling yet compelling and hard not to want to see what happens... it's a good movie that keeps me awake in a dark room at night. </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin came in just past 10:30 when we were fifteen minutes from the end of it. We left with DVD in hand to finish watching at home, which we did. Doug also put on the clips included with the movie... an interview with the real manager of the hotel, visits to the burial sites and memorial halls, and interviews with the writer and director of the film as well. I did fall asleep through the last of these, washed, and read until almost 1 a.m. </p>
<p>p.s. Oh! The heading! Today out of the blue Riku mentioned that he had bitten Amelia. This happened about two plus weeks ago. I said yes, that he had made Amelia cry. His response... "no biting, no hitting, no pushing, no licking"! ... and then he licked me! I licked him right back; it is funny after all, although maybe not something we want to encourage exactly but we made each other laugh. Riku often ends something like this by saying "That funny. Nana laughing."</p>
<p>And one more note; Bryn told me today that he had allowed Riku to watch the beginning portion of one of the Star War movies (I believe). Riku was quite taken with it, and when it had been turned off (the rest is too violent) Riku asked "Watch just the beginning portion?"</p>
