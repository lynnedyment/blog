								<h2>Pool Time.. for Kevin!</h2>
								<p>Today I had visions of a full day at home, doing all the things that kept me awake last night... online photo sorting, catching up with emails once more, writing letters, vacuuming... all the things I didn't get to this week. I got off to a late start, which was not a good thing, sleeping until 8:45 a.m. I had gone downstairs to Riku's room at 3 a.m. so that I could read without disturbing Doug. That did the trick as I was asleep in less than ten minutes; I should have done this an hour earlier instead of making mental lists of what needed doing! </p>
<p>I had decided to send Doug off to the Independent Book Fair on his own, and getting started at my list of chores. Instead I talked to Gail for quite a while; she suggested that the housework could wait (it has been waiting for quite some time!) and that I really should go off with Doug and enjoy some time away from the house. So, with no time for anything more than a quick shower and making the bed, I dashed off, sans breakfast! on this already hot morning. </p>
<p>I hadn't intended to buy any books, as I have more than plenty to read right here, but of course who can ignore those bargains? The book I am most anxious to read first is a non-fiction book called "War Orphan in San Francisco", about a ten-year-old Jewish girl, an only child, sent from Vienna to San Francisco on her own during WW2. After flipping through the book, I was introduced to the author who was sitting at the end of the aisle, and had a chance to chat with her for a few minutes... her father survived the war, but not her mother; she was the only child of the ten she travelled with to come to San Francisco; she stayed with a distant relative for six months and then lived in several orphanages before being reunited with her father many years later. He had kept all their correspondence during their years apart, and this is the foundation of the book. My kind of book for certain. </p>
<p>It was hot, hot, hot, and I kept to the shady spots as much as I could. I'm sure I could have found more bargains but it was just not comfortable being out there in the sun. However, Doug and I thought that we must take Riku to Yerba Buena Gardens soon, as he would so enjoy the multi-level fountain and the carousel too. Kelly and the two children spent some time there on every trip but the last one. </p>
<p>Doug had noticed an Indian restaurant on our walk to the fair, and realized it was one he had on a list to try. We haven't been eating out and so it was a treat to sit in an air-conditoned room and eat several different dishes... pakoras and samosas for me, as well as potato tikki, while Doug enjoyed a catfish wrap, dipped in spicy chickpea flour and fried. It was good... not fantastic, but worth a try for sure. </p>
<p>Off to "Trader Joe's" for soy milk, some frozen berries for Riku's cereal and my fruit bowl, and butter to mix up. There was a message from Susan saying that Kevin would like to bring Amelia over for some pool time, as she had a bit of a sunburn on her arms and needed to keep her out of the sun. I quickly emptied the pool, with Doug's help, cleaned it, and then refilled it with some warm water as well, so it wasn't too too cold for Amelia. </p>
<p>I have needed a haircut badly for more than two weeks and decided I couldn't deal with it anymore! I was lucky enough to get in to see Bing, my favourite gal, at Super Cuts in Noe Valley. Such a bargain... a $15 dollar haircut and every bit as good as some $40 plus cuts I have had lately. I felt human again! </p>
<p>Doug had gone up with me, to check out a couple of stores he rarely gets to any more, and had noticed a woman selling children's clothing and toys. She was almost giving them away... a Gap long-sleeved top with an animal on the front, tag still on, for 50 cents! which is also what she charged for three or four toys in tip-top condition. They are a bit young for Amelia and Riku but not enough that they won't have some fun with them. In fact, Doug put fresh batteries in a pull-along turtle toy, and Amelia and Riku were both taken with the little songs it sings and the blinking lights on top. I also bought a pair of pull-on jogging pants for Riku to have as a spare here, along with the top.</p>
<p>We arrived home just as Kevin and Amelia pulled up; she was just finishing off a good hour and a half nap in the car and was ready to stretch her legs... but not in the pool! Kevin did everything he could to entice her in, including getting in himself, making whale splashes, putting her on his shoulders, and soaking his head in the water, but it wasn't enough to convince Amelia.</p>
<p>Riku and Bryn showed up just a few minutes after Amelia and Kevin, and he too had zero interest in going in the pool; he did laugh at Kevin's antics though, and enjoyed getting splashed, but that was enough for him. Funny, as it was so hot out there but... who knows! </p>
<p>The children had a great time playing in the house, upstairs and downstairs. Riku sat on the bed surrounded by books, Amelia joined him, they snacked on some berries and toast, Amelia coaxed Kevin upstairs for block building, Riku joined them... and then Bryn and I went up as well. Bryn, after playing a game of Sudoku on the computer, decided to get out the wooden block set he had bought in Russia many years ago, and I found a doll for Amelia and some whistles that Riku thought were just terrific. He carried them downstairs later on, saying "These are very delicate". We cannot believe how his vocabulary is expanding every day! </p>
<p>The children were so cute running around in just their diapers. Riku was reluctant to take off his shirt, despite being too hot. His hair was wet with sweat until he took off his shirt and shorts, which thank goodness he did eventually. Amelia is repeating words so well; even words that should be difficult for her aren't. We all agree that she is one very smart little girl. It's hard to imagine at times that she is almost a year younger than Riku. They are very different personalities, of course, so it is not easy to compare them; this is a good thing! </p>
<p>Riku played with the buttons again for a bit, and the two children ran around with the push toys as well. At 6:45 both Daddies were packing up their reluctant children to go home. Riku cried a little bit and wanted me to carry him down to the car and put him in his seat too. I piled up all his things on him... a tiny car, a book, an animal, and more... and off he went. I'm sure he was happy to get home building with his daddy, and for dinner too. Bryn wrote later to say he had been using some of the blocks like dominoes and that Riku was enjoying knocking them down. That led to a discussion about whether we still had the dominoes that Bryn used as a child, doing just what he did for Riku tonight. He was all set to buy some on eBay but Doug told him he was welcome to our old set. Bryn's response? "Sweet!"</p>
<p>I cleaned up the kitchen, took the toys out of the pool (Doug helped me cover it up), and then was too hot to even think about dinner. Doug helped himself to some beans and "hot dogs" and I had a bowl of soup, reheated, just to get it out of the fridge. We also each had two pieces of delicious whole wheat bread Bryn and Akane bought for us in Japantown. Yum!</p>
<p>Doug played old songs from the early fifties, found on the computer, while I rearranged and annotated photos online beside him. He was amazed at how many songs we knew the words to, songs that were very familiar to us, after working out that we were only 6-7 years old when they were hits! Both of us had mothers who loved music, had it playing all the time, and sang too. Lucky us!</p>
<p>Off to bed... 11:20 p.m.</p>
