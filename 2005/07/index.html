								<h2><a href="/2005/07/an_amelia_day_to_end_my_week.html">An Amelia Day to End My Week!</a></h2>
								<p>Well, it was a lovely day with Miss Amelia. Her mommy was having some (not magor) surgery today and so we had the day together. Kevin dropped her off at 8:30 on this sunny breezy day. Kevin told me she was already a little tired and had not eaten much so we spent some quiet time upstairs. I ironed while Amelia played with the farm, looked at some books, and meandered about in and out of the bathroom/bedroom keeping busy. She also spent some time sitting on Grandpa's lap and taking him by the hand to show him something interesting. </p>
<p>At 10:15 she ate a container of yogurt and finished off some pistachios and toast she had been nibbling on when she first arrived. I put her to sleep in Riku's room at 10:30 but she slept only 55 minutes today; I thought she was still tired but hoped she would nap a little later in the day as well. Up she got, big smiles, and was happy to go outside to feed the blue jay peanuts, and put stones in a bucket I gave to her. Once in a while she would come in and show us a stone before taking it back and adding it to her collection. </p>
<p>Of course the bee had a few turns around the house, the musical instruments were brought out from the laundry room, and she had a couple of balls rolling around too. We played ring-a-round a rosy a few times as she really loves the falling down part! </p>
<p>We read at the table while Amelia polished off all of her spinach/rice dish, her pesto pasta, and the applesauce Susan had packed for her. Usually Amelia eats smaller portions frequently but today she was happy to eat larger amounts; must be a growth spurt coming on. She stood on my scale today and weighed in at 24 pounds fully dressed. </p>
<p>Amelia has started repeating words I say right back at me and very clearly too! I told Susan yesterday that I am amazed at how quickly the hand signs have disappeared and words have emerged. At one point today Amelia dropped some pine seeds and I said "oh my goodness!" and Amelia immediately looked at me and said "oh my goo'ness". It was really adorable and is happening more often than I can say. Kevin told me tonight that just recently she has started repeating the last word of a sentence he says back at him... so he will say "It's all over" and Amelia says "over" instantly. She will be talking very well very quickly! </p>
<p>She and Doug walked a couple of blocks to the mailbox at 1:30 and on the way home Amelia wanted "up!" Not too much later, I tried to tuck her into bed, as she was yawning and rubbing her eyes. However, for whatever reason, she just would not settle, although came very very close. She's a character though! I asked her to close her eyes after they popped open when I finished singing a song, so she did as she was told... closed them up tightly, and then a minute later put both her arms across them. I couldn't see her eyes at all but knew from the smile on her face that she wasn't drifting off back to sleep! No point in her lying there, so up we got. Amelia loves turning off the ocean sounds as it means she is getting up! </p>
<p>I gave her another snack, put her on the toilet, and off we went in the stroller for a long walk/short nap I hoped. It took about a half hour before she settled in; there was a flock of pigeons to inspect first, and then a big crowd of school children out on an excursion, both of which made her sit up to comment on them! Finally, at 3:45 she was in a lovely deep sleep, which lasted for forty-five minutes. I was so pleased as I don't want her raring to go until 10 p.m. tonight for her parents! </p>
<p>We were just five minutes from the playground and we had arranged for Kevin to pick her up there. Amelia spotted that familiar corner and piped up with "playg'ound"; we had almost an hour there, with Amelia trying so hard to play with a little girl's doll stroller and finally had to settle for a ball. However, she also kept busy on a four sided teeter-totter and two rocking toys as well as the usual climbing up and down the steps of the playhouse. </p>
<p>Kevin met us at 5:30, as planned, and since Riku had not shown up with Akane, I drove back to our place with them for Kevin to pick Amelia's bag. I made a quick dinner for Doug and me, and off I went upstairs with a hot cup of tea to watch some taped Oprah's, now piling up quickly. It was just what I needed, although I should have continued on with annotating the photos from Japan. I got started at them while Amelia was sleeping... however.... </p>
<p>Marie also called and we had a long chat about her difficult day with her mom's viewing. However, she also had a fun bit of news for me. The daughter of her parent's friends was at the viewing today and told Marie she has a tape of her at "Buffalo Bandstand", a show that was very popular when we were teenagers. I am on it too, and Marie will get a copy of it made for me as well. Apparently this gal's parents had a video camera and had driven Marie there and taped some of the show. I'm sure this will be such a hoot to see, after forty-odd years! Marie had no idea it even existed, and there are also bits of her mom and dad at a party with relatives and other friends. Can't wait for September when I will see it. </p>
<p>Doug came up and we watched a taped doo wop show, which we both enjoy so much. We were singing along to those great old songs, and the highlight of it was we saw Jack Scott, who sang a song we both loved and still do... "What in the World's Come Over You?" Doug played it three times and is now busy on the computer trying to find a DVD copy of the show for us. I will certainly be sharing it with my siblings and friends. </p>
<p>Riku called at 8 p.m. to say a very quiet goodnight to me. This is very early for him to go to bed, so he must be a very tired little fellow. We talked a little bit about the puppy he held in the playground yesterday; I do have the sweetest photo of this. Ah, if only dogs weren't such a big responsibility! Riku and Amelia both would love to have a dog in their lives. </p>
<p>Good news today is that Bryn called me at 8:50 this morning to say that Riku had not cried even a bit when he left him today! Yahoo! What good news! He took in a stuffed animal from home today, so maybe that, along with knowing the main teacher will take care of him if necessary, has given him the comfort he needs to cope with his new schedule. Riku told me that he didn't play with the other children; when I asked if he played by himself he said yes. What fun it would be if we could see how he spends these four hours!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/finally_the_ironing_is_done.html">Finally, the Ironing is Done!</a></h2>
								<p>And yes, that is worth being the heading for this blog, as the ironing has been hanging around far too long. It had started to collect when I was in Japan, and continued to build up in the more than three weeks since my return. It is such a relief to have it caught up with and over, until the Monday wash! </p>
<p>I was tempted to go off to a double feature with Doug today, but had second thoughts when I realized how much housework there was to do, and a dinner party to arrange for Doug's birthday tomorrow. I resisted, and am so glad I did! I had time to read the paper, make Doug's cheesecake, iron for three hours!, clean both bathrooms thoroughly, and vacuum and dust upstairs. I did manage to do the main floor yesterday. The house feels like home again. </p>
<p>At 5:30 I was making a grocery list for the dinner tomorrow, and at 6 p.m. we picked up Akane and Riku for a quick trip to Rainbow. Riku, unfortunately, is sick. His throat sounds rough and husky, he is feeling quite sensitive, his dad told me, and he has an infrequent but hard cough which doesn't sound good at all. </p>
<p>We pulled up at their house just a few minutes after Mark and his girlfriend, Chelsea, arrived by motorcycle from Vancouver! It was great to see Mark again; it has been years, and I am looking forward to spending some time getting to know Chelsea. </p>
<p>Riku was happy to see us and ready to go to Rainbow for some cheese! Off we went and picked up what we needed, with Riku mostly wandering around the aisles but also wanting to be picked up, which is rare in that store. He is not feeling up to tucker at all. </p>
<p>While at Rainbow, Doug was holding Riku in his arms and Riku started waving his arms in a big arc asking "What is this?" Doug was taking wild guesses... "a building?", "a store?" when Riku answered it himself, pointing to a painting on the far wall... "That is a rainbow". And yes, it was indeed a rainbow. </p>
<p>Akane had to drop in at the studio for her wallet, and Doug went to the bank, so Riku and I sat in the car chatting. It was such fun, as Riku first noticed the murals on the wall of the pet store and described them to me in detail... "Oh, that is a dog, and 'nother dog, and a cat, and there is a bird and a snake". And looking to his left, he said "Oh, that is a bridge and what is that?" "Oh, that is a big hill" and to the right was a "bulding". He also did lots of pretending... held a little "puppy" in his hands and asked me to pet it, and then it was a "little cat" and finally a "little mouse", and they ate and drank and put out their "little tongues". They were "sleepy, Riku let them go to sleep". And when the little stuffed bear we keep in the car for him fell, he cuddled it and loved and kissed it. He is just darling with his stuffed animals and now the imagination is really kicking in too. </p>
<p>After dropping Akane off, we drove to a block on 24th Street looking for a burrito place; Doug left the car to search it out and Riku asked "where are we going?" Riku going to Nana's house for little while to play cars with Nana" and I reassured him that we were coming here. He also sang, completely on his own with no suggestion from me at all, his one full song "Down at the Station". I must get this on video tape as it is really sweet to hear. </p>
<p>Dropped Akane off at the house at 7:10 p.m. and Riku came home with us, for a little playtime, while his parents and houseguests went to the Roosevelt for dinner. I put together a quick pizza for Doug and me, with lots of extra tomatoes, and Riku ate a big bowl of oatmeal, with fresh strawberries, flax seed and wheat germ, three-quarters of a piece of grainy toast, a half of a banana, and a big drink of "super food". He was a hungry boy, despite his sore throat; he pointed to the back of his throat while he was eating. Poor wee guy. However, we looked at a new book with googly eyes tonight which Riku really enjoyed. He must have asked twenty times over the course of the book "what is this?" and Doug would try to guess which sea creature it was supposed to be... wildly imaginative sea horses, clams, blowfish, and clown fish. When I handed Riku the second book "The Very Quiet Cricket" he said "Riku turn it" and his face just lit up when he turned that very last page to hear the cricket chirping away. </p>
<p>Bryn told me a three sentence paragraph Riku came out with today; (I shall try to get Bryn to tell it to me tomorrow so I can write it down) it's astounding how his English is improving so much, considering how much Japanese he is hearing lately. Every day I feel I should have a notebook handy to write down all the new concepts Riku has grasped. One of the things he said to Bryn today after breakfast at "Jim's" with Kevin and Amelia, walking back to the car was "Where is OUR car?" </p>
<p>We had just a few minutes of playing upstairs with the farm when Bryn came by to pick Riku up. It was almost 9 p.m. and more than past time for Riku's bed, and he complained only a little bit about going home. He had a busy day today, starting out at the playground with his dad, Kevin and Amelia, then the restaurant, and on to the SF zoo. Both children slept a short while in the car on the way, and then both had a short nap in the afternoon as well.</p>
<p>Doug took him down to the car to let him "drive" it for a bit until Bryn collected up sheets, pillows, and a duvet for his house guests. </p>
<p>I made a hot cup of tea, my first one today, and went upstairs with it to watch Oprah tapes. Off to bed now... midnight and it's Doug's birthday! He is asleep already though. Riku hit his glasses today and Doug had to manage the rest of the evening wearing his sunglasses! He will have to get them replaced tomorrow...</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/a_wednesday_with_riku.html">A Wednesday with Riku</a></h2>
								<p>I thought I wouldn't be seeing Riku until later in the day today, if at all, so called Carol Woods at 7:30 to catch up with her; it has been a long time since we have chatted. At 9 a.m. we were still catching up! The doorbell rang and Riku was there, all big smiles, and ready to come and visit for the day. What a lovely surprise; Carol and I made plans to finish up our conversation next week. </p>
<p>Riku is still coughing a bit, and so we had a quiet day at home. He wasn't interested in going out to the garden, so we did just what he wanted to... I read books to him, "Small Pig" included as it has been a while since we read it. I was amazed at how many of the last few words of most pages he could fill in; he started doing this in Japan but we have been reading other books more frequently since then. </p>
<p>He wanted to "go upstairs, play with barn and chickens" so while he was busy moving the animals around and having the "grandma" clean up the barn (as in "Small Pig") I got some of the ironing done... mostly Riku's little shirts and pants and a few flat items too. </p>
<p>Bryn said Riku hadn't eaten much for breakfast at home... toast, and a little milk, so I made him pancakes, "bacon", and fresh strawberries. He really enjoyed dipping his pancakes into the little puddle of maple syrup! </p>
<p>We played with one of Doug's birthday balloons for a while, played hide-and-seek, and he drew as well. Nap time soon followed and Riku slept for an hour and twenty minutes. He wanted me to hold him for the longest time, which is unusual anymore for him; since I came back from Hawaii he has wanted me to put him down on the bed and then stroke his hair and forehead. Yup, it's clear he is not quite well. His voice sounds quite husky and his throat raspy and he's just not quite himself. Akane told me later though that he is much better today so that was good news. </p>
<p>After his nap Riku was ready for lunch; I gave him some soba noodles in broth with minced carrots, spinach, a bit of tofu, and some kabocha squash too. He ate all but one tiny bite of it, and a whole peach and more strawberries too! </p>
<p>We went back upstairs, I did a little more ironing while Riku went through all the upstairs children's books, one by one, very slowly and carefully, talking to himself about what was on each page. When he finished he asked me for "more books downstairs?" so I came down, picked up five more and he went through those as well. It sure was fun hearing him saying to himself "one green dog under the roof"! We did have a little snuggle too and read three of them right through. </p>
<p>Riku said he didn't want to go to the beach or the playground but I wanted him to have some fresh air. He had a snack of yogurt with blueberries and flax seeds, and then went over to one of the big drawers in the kitchen, tried pulling it open and said "cookies in there!" and yes, there are cookies in there. We pulled it open together and he ate two small ginger snaps and a digestive biscuit Susan had brought over the other day.</p>
<p>We left the house in the late afternoon for a stroller ride; I need the exercise and Riku needed the air, so off we went. There was a little wind, and he was snuggled in with a warm jacket and two animals... his dog from here and his lion from home, the first time lion has been over here.</p>
<p>Riku had told me he wanted to take "many animals" but I told him there was just room for two. He came walking out with many from his room, counting all the while he was in there... I wasn't listening carefully but I am quite sure he counted all the way to twelve, missing number ten! I am going to check this out in the next few days. I always count going up and down the stairs but, unlike Bryn and Caillie who started counting with me, Riku never has. Sounds as though he may know his numbers though! </p>
<p>Riku was asleep in less than ten minutes and I enjoyed my walk through the Mission, walking on the shady side of the street so Riku wouldn't be too warm. I walked over to 24th Street to buy oranges when he woke, walked a bit further, and then decided to call Akane to see if I should just walk Riku home. </p>
<p>Akane had been at the studio today and I was closer to their house than to mine. I had forgotten that Bryn was at his Japanese lessons tonight, so picked up two burritos and walked over for dinner with Akane. We had dinner together last week too; it works out nicely, especially when Doug is away as well. </p>
<p>Riku dragged all three of his boxes of blocks into the kitchen so we could play; I fed him the meal Akane had ready for him while we built a building and chatted. He is such an interesting little conversationalist! He ate a good dinner, and finished up most of it while showing me how well he is using the scissors. </p>
<p>I left him sitting with his mommy and scooted home to order my online photos. I was halfway through and the website went down, so now I am hoping I haven't lost an hours worth of work!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/thursday_feels_like_friday.html">Thursday... Feels Like Friday!</a></h2>
								<p>Slept in 'til 7:15 this morning; felt wonderful to roll over at 6 a.m. and drop off again! Out the door at 8:30 to pick Riku up for nursery school. He was pretty quiet on the way over and I thought me might drop off to sleep, even though Bryn told me he was still sleeping when he left the house at 7:30. </p>
<p>Riku walked willingly to the door of the school with me and then wanted up in my arms. The main teacher greeted him, took him from me and held him; we both pointed out the bags of coloured paper for each child and paper birds hanging from the rafters. Riku was distracted and I put his bag in his cubby, saying goodbye as I walked by. He started to cry with his hands over his eyes, but when I picked him up at 1 p.m. I was told that he had cried for just a few minutes. </p>
<p>It was a special Japanese holiday so Riku came home with the bag of coloured papers, and two large fronds from a plant of some kind. I sat in the back seat with him, fed him a large bowl of porridge with blueberries and strawberries, he drank lots of water, and wanted a cookie as well. Luckily, I had a couple of digestives and a ginger snap with me, so that worked out just fine. </p>
<p>My goal was to get him home for his nap, but despite lots of "sing farm chicken" singing, those eyes were drooping almost immediately. Riku slept from 1:20 until 2:50 in a shady spot on 17th Street. When he awoke I started to drive home, just a few minutes away, and within one minute he was sound asleep again! This time I parked over in my neighbourhood where it was a little quieter and shady as well, and he was in a deep sleep until 3:40. </p>
<p>Riku was still a little dozey and teary when I took him out of his car seat, so had to go upstairs with him in my arms, plus his lion, the last of his snack, and the dog and blanket I had with me for his head and the breeze... and of course his lunch/kit bag, and the paper bag, and the two large fronds! I am woman, hear me roar! </p>
<p>Akane was at the door and she was ready to decorate using the paper he had brought home. I came right home, had some lunch, and got busy with the paper work covering my kitchen table, and back to ordering hundreds of prints online! Ah yes, I must get busy getting them into albums. I also called the doula co-ordinator as I am determined to get working on that as soon as I can. </p>
<p>Quiet evening at home; I chatted with Susan and Amelia after Amelia left a lovely message on my answering machine. She had a twelve hour sleep last night! and a three hour nap today! after which she said "Nana?" so Susan had her call me. The message from Amelia? "Hi Nana!" and "I love you"... very clear to me as I have heard her say it before, and then "goodbye". We had a little chat too. </p>
<p>Skyped with Gail for a few minutes, exchanged two very sweet emails with Uncle Frank, and then went off to pick up Doug from his 8:45 flight from LA. The bombing in London today did not affect airport security at all; Doug thinks the line was shorter than it has been in the recent past.</p>
<p>There was a message on the machine from Bryn, left at 8:50, saying Riku had been calling to say goodnight... and I missed it. Darn! I look forward to my goodnight calls.  </p>
<p>Have completed my online photo order, thank goodness, after some help from Susan with two problems... </p>
<p>Off to bed at 11:15 p.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/friday_at_home.html">Friday at Home</a></h2>
								<p>This was an unusual Friday as I spent the entire day at home. I had considered going off to the Kabuki and/or using my pedicure certificate from Susan, but I settled in at various and sundry jobs around the house and ended up sticking to them instead. </p>
<p>It felt good to just sit at the computer and annotate the Japanese photos; it's time they were done! and it has been a longer and slower job because of the incorrect dates on the photo files. Next time I will set the camera to the date of my destination and not leave it in SF mode! I didn't get them all finished but came within fifty before relaxing with a cup of tea and watching taped Oprah's... also stacking up. </p>
<p>I continued with the ironing as well. I think the pants are reproducing up there as I don't seem to be coming to the end of this darned laundry at all this week! Since coming back from our trip I feel I have done more ironing than anything else and it is not my favourite job... but... thank you Oprah for reminding me... I am grateful to have clothes to iron, and electricity to do it, and family wearing the clothes... but I still wish there were less of it! </p>
<p>I had offered to sit for Susan and Kevin, as I haven't seen Amelia for a couple of days, and miss her. However, Susan and Amelia spent a lot of the day outside today... a three hour nap this morning for Miss Amelia, while Susan pushed the stroller, and then zoo time in the afternoon, so a quiet night at home and an early night appealed to Susan. </p>
<p>I called to see if Bryn and Akane wanted to go out for dinner or a movie, but Bryn was on his way to the park with Riku. Riku had a good day; didn't cry even a bit when Bryn dropped him off at school today which is so good to hear. He didn't nap until he got home with Akane at 2:30! but then had a good long nap. </p>
<p>It was almost 6 p.m. and I thought the playground might close at 6:30; Bryn asked if we wanted to join him there so we took the car instead of walking so we would have as much time there with them as possible. Good thing too as it was already closed and we were able to drive to Delores Park instead. It was a little windy and fairly cool, but Riku enjoyed climbing on the wooden play structure, going down the slide a couple of times with us, walking and exploring with Doug, and admiring a dog. The wind picked up and Riku was a little short of breath; he didn't like it a bit; it was also damp with heavy fog so it was time to leave. We dropped them off at 7 p.m. and came home for a late dinner. </p>
<p>Susan left an email message saying they had watched a movie and had dinner in the living room. Sounded like a perfect Friday night to me. Doug and I also ended up with a quiet evening in front of the telly; I cooked up some ravioli Susan had bought fresh for us at a local pasta store, added homemade tomato sauce and some good grated cheese to it, and I made a big green salad... taking it all upstairs to eat while watching a Masterpiece Theatre movie, and a taped Ed Sullivan show showing many of his guests from the sixties... the Beatles, Roy Orbison, Ray Charles, Jackie Wilson, Mamas and the Papas, The Rolling Stones, Credence Clearwater Revival, Janis Joplin, Loving Spoonful, James Brown and others. It was great and brought back many memories. Doug had seen many of them live so it made it even more fun to watch. </p>
<p>Riku called at 9 p.m. to say goodnight. I smile every time I hear that little voice saying "goodnight sweetheart" to me and "see you tomorrow". I always hope I will... </p>
<p>Back down for more photo work and Doug got involved with redoing some of the PEA website, so we worked quietly away on the computers until after 12:30!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/the_goat_or_who_is_sylvia.html">"The Goat or Who is Sylvia?"</a></h2>
								<p>Doug and I both slept in later than is usual for us this morning; that heavy fog hanging over the city made it easy to pull the covers up and snuggle back in for an extra hour today. Going to bed at 1 a.m. helped too. </p>
<p>We both sat at our computers after reading the paper and having breakfast. I finished up the annotations for the Japanese photos at last!!!!, although I am now looking for a sheet with the names of two of the people I met there. I answered a few emails and was ready to catch the bus at 12:20. Parking is difficult downtown and especially so on Saturday so a bus seemed like a good idea. Good thing too as traffic was very heavy and we got to sit and read our books on the trip there and back.  </p>
<p>We have tickets to an Edward Albee play which started at 2 p.m. The tickets were Doug's birthday gift from Bryn, Akane, Susan, and Kevin and I was lucky enough to be included as his guest! The plan was to have lunch downtown too, but we didn't have a lot of time and prices were sky-high in that neighbourhood. A tuna sandwich for $11! or an all-day diner breakfast for $12. During the last fifteen minutes left to find something we happened upon a taqueria which got good reviews and each ordered a burrito... brown rice, ww tortilla, black beans, and salsa for $3.25. Doug added cheese to his and I avocado to mine; a big basket of chips and salsa was included as well. I ate half of mine and will have the other half for lunch tomorrow. Yum! </p>
<p>The play was in quite a small theatre so our seats at the back still gave us a very good view of centre stage. The theatre was packed full, and the play has been held over for an extra week. </p>
<p>This was true theatre! Four characters, all of whom performed very well, no intermission, and the time flew by... two and a half plus hours. It was funny, sad, disturbing somewhat, touching, quirky, and witty, with some great lines and certainly with not a slow moment in the entire play. I can see why it is a hit and we read that the actors here did a better job with it than the NYC actors two years ago. It must be a hard play to do when they first start out as it is quite outrageous material... long married couple with a gay son; life is good for all of them, until the husband's affair of six months is revealed... with a goat! Yup! Quite a story. </p>
<p>Home for hot cup of tea, after which I finally finished the ironing once more!, and watched some taped Oprah's. I ran through lots of tapes though, as many were repeats. </p>
<p>Doug and I had a light dinner after he returned from helping Bryn with his scooter (bought in Vietnam to sell at a profit here), and some play time with Riku. We watched an episode of a British detective  show we always enjoy, came downstairs for a little more computer time, and we're off to bed soon. Doug flies to L.A. at 10 a.m. tomorrow. </p>
<p>Riku called at 9:10 to say goodnight; I am enjoying this little ritual of ours. Thank you Bryn! Riku told me that he had put chopsticks down the drain! and Mommy and Daddy were angry. Oh dear! He was all ready for bed and repeated my "goodnight honey" to me before saying he would see me tomorrow. </p>
<p>Good news from Don via email. They have a conditional offer on their house and it's looking good; they hope to move into their new home on July 29th, my birthday!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/the_weekend_is_over_already.html">The Weekend is Over... Already!</a></h2>
								<p>I drove Doug to the airport today at 9 a.m. which made it seem like a Monday; of course it feels as though the weekend is over early! I came home and read the Sunday paper while eating an egg and toast and enjoying my big mug (made by Caillie) of hot chocolate. I sat and annotated Amelia's album, finished it up and got started on Riku's... all to avoid getting at the very messy pile of paper work still undone! Tomorrow for certain... </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin are off to see the play today that Doug and I saw yesterday, so I left the house at noon to drive over to their place. Amelia had had a nice long nap after breakfast and playground time with Riku and family, and was eating her lunch when I arrived. Kevin and Susan left at 12:45, Amelia finished up her lunch and we spent some time just hanging around the apartment. Susan had bought me some Japanese vegetable gyoza (pot stickers) and inari, so I ate half of those, and then had a small bowl of Susan's homemade potato salad. It was so good I had a second bowl!, and then a cup of tea. Amelia and I shared a slice of delicious lemon loaf as well, reading a few books while we did so. We also played hide-and-seek which is hilarious as Amelia "hides" in plain view and then shrieks like mad when I "find" her! I whistle to let her know where I am and she shrieks when she finds me too! It is the funniest thing to see. </p>
<p>I decided to walk to a playground in Golden Gate park rather than go to the one across the street from their house. It's lovely to have lots of time with Amelia when she isn't sleeping so this was the perfect opportunity to go to the less frequently visited play area. There was another little girl there, very close to Amelia's age... Emilia... and they must have spent a good half hour taking turns going up and down a rubber ramp being careful to switch sides and avoid bumping into each other. They were so closely matched in their abilities that is was wonderful for them; the bigger children make the platform move more than is comfortable for them. She also managed to talk her way into a fig newton from a mom! </p>
<p>Amelia loves to swing so she had a good long push and then it was back to the wooden structure. This time around Amelia tried it all backwards!... walking backwards on the swinging ramp, and backwards on the platform too. We stopped for a snack break for her; she ate some custard and drank water and then hurried back to the stairs and rope platform. Amelia is so self-assured on these various structures that it really amazes me. Children quite a bit older are much more cautious. </p>
<p>She heard sirens today, put her finger to her ear, and said "siren", nodding seriouosly, and says "backwards" very clearly as well. It's hard to remember all her newest phrases and words as they are coming on so quickly these past few weeks. </p>
<p>On the way home we stopped to watch some rollerbladers; music was playing and there were about a dozen or more people moving to music. Amelia ate all of her fresh fruit snack there and a few circle snacks on the way home. Susan and Kevin were there when we arrived, although Amelia got sidetracked by the cat in the next apartment and invited herself in to track down the cat! </p>
<p>Susan had a pot of tea ready, Kevin sliced up some fresh banana bread Susan had made, and we had a little visit. Amelia pushed her big stroller around the apartment while Kevin pushed her tiny baby stroller in front of her; it was very amusing but that's the way Amelia wanted it, even if she did get stuck and frustrated now and then. </p>
<p>I think it's going to be an early to bed night for Amelia as she was showing signs of tiredness when I left at 5:30 and Susan was going to get her right into the tub. </p>
<p>Bryn had left a message for me on the answering machine just before I got home inviting me for dinner and some play time with Riku. I had had lots to eat today and came home with the leftover Japanese treats too, so passed on dinner, and suggested that Riku come over here while Akane cooked dinner for them. Bryn brought him over and stayed, looking at the Japanese photos (and pointing out some errors that need correcting... spellings, place names...) while Riku and I swept the garden and played upstairs with the farm... of course! </p>
<p>Riku had been to his first movie today in a theatre! and walked in telling me all about the "broken castle and the broken house but the man fixed it". Whew! He had been acting it out on his bed at home before he came over but was soon busy doing other things while he was here. He even helped me pour the banana bread mixture into the pan, but I managed to forget about it while enjoying a hot cup of tea upstairs watching an Oprah tape. Darn! I am quite sure that Akane and Riku are out of banana bread by now and it made good use of the two ripe bananas I had here... </p>
<p>... and I had my phone call from Riku at 8:50, telling me he was in his pj's, his teeth were brushed and he was ready for bed. "Night honey" and "I love you" made my night. </p>
<p>Doug called later on Skype later on as well; he had a great lunch and a tasty dinner out in L.A. although couldn't get into the room where he is teaching tomorrow. So, he hopes that everything he needs will be there when he shows up tomorrow. </p>
<p>More annotating. Now to bed with paperwork awaiting me tomorrow... no more putting it off! Upstairs... 11:45 p.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/this_is_not_good.html">"This is Not Good!"</a></h2>
								<p>How lovely it was to waken at 7:15 with Riku's sweet face next to mine. We both had a great sleep; I went to bed at 10:30 and Riku just an hour earlier, due to that terribly late nap yesterday that seemed to have no end! Bryn came over at 7:30 to take him home for breakfast with them, before Riku went to school and Bryn to work. </p>
<p>I phoned Elizabeth immediately to confirm her flight times for San Diego in August; I am hoping to go with her, depending on the cost of the flight, but needed to know just when I had to be in San Diego to meet her. We would be gone from the 4th to the 8th of August and would have the weekend free to spend with Gregory and his friend, as well as Gregory's half sister and her daughter. I do hope this pans out as Elizabeth and I have vowed to meet up for some time together once a year. The years fly by too fast to let this friendship slide. </p>
<p>Kelly "messaged" me saying all four children were home, back from their two sets of grandparents, and so I phoned and had good long chats with all of them. Caillie and Myk' were helping each other clean their bedrooms. Caillie's was not a big mess, she told me, but just had some books and papers around to clean up. Gee, she sounds like someone else I know! Bryant had fun in the Manitoulin but was happy to be home, and Bryn promised he would make me a birthday card and might even write me a letter. Bry' also thanked me for the birthday books we gave him and said he had loaned one of them to a friend. He might write me a little note after he finishes each one so that I know if he enjoyed them or not. </p>
<p>Showered, ate breakfast, read the paper and then got busy sorting through the same stack of paper work. I'm getting there but it sure is boring and is taking too long! </p>
<p>Off to pick up Riku at 12:35. He was a happy boy and came out dragging his little carry-all containing his lunch "pail", extra clothes, etc. It is a hot day here today and I sat in the back seat of the car with him with the door open wide giving him his after-school "snack" which today was banana yogurt with lots of blueberries in it. He ate a couple of cookies and drank almost a full container of water while we drove home. </p>
<p>The object of the drive is to get him here without his falling asleep. I thought I had done so well today; I had taken along a favourite flip-up book ("Spot's First Easter), and when that was done we sang songs together ("sing alligator song", "sing Jack and Jill song"), and then I made him laugh out loud by making funny throat sounds, but all to no avail, as he fell asleep three minutes before I pulled into the garage! </p>
<p>Taking him out of his car seat was no fun at all; he cried and didn't want to be disturbed. I didn't blame him a bit but sitting in the garage for two hours was not an option! I managed to carry him upstairs, get his socks, sandals, shirt and pants off, but he was not a happy little fellow while this was going on. Next time I will just pull off to a shady street and let him finish his nap, undisturbed, in the car. However, fifteen minutes later I was able to leave the room, with him sleeping soundly. </p>
<p>At forty minutes, he woke with a dirty diaper, again crying as I changed him and settled him again. And, once again, I was successful, even though he was really clinging to me, with an arm wrapped around my neck, making it more difficult to extricate myself! </p>
<p>Susan and Amelia had come in during this time. I had uncovered the pool this morning so the children could cool off in the water, and we had to add big pans of hot water to it before Amelia would agree to go in. And this is a child who walks in Ocean Beach! ... but not up to her chest. She would have stayed in longer if Riku had been in with her, but she got bored and decided it was much more fun to have her Mommy push around the other noise-maker popper, while she did the bee... her favourite. </p>
<p>Amelia looked too adorable for words in her pink and green watermelon  seed two piece swimming suit!  </p>
<p>Riku woke at the two hour mark, but wanted to do nothing more than snuggle in my arms, not go in the pool, and not get off my lap! Susan and Amelia left soon after as now Amelia was needing her nap. Riku slowly came round to his normal happy little self and had me rolling around on his bed with him. "Let's do more wrestling" says Riku! Not my favourite thing to do, as I worry about the wooden side rails (even though I cover them with the pillows) but Riku just loves it so much, that I didn't think of refusing. He just likes to tumble around, throwing the thin cotton blankets over me, and having me do the same to him. It's very funny and I saw it first with Amelia a couple of weeks ago. </p>
<p>He had a nice small "snack" of oatmeal and the bit of leftover fruit from his lunch, and finished off the few halves of pistachios we had cut for Amelia. He likes them a lot, but they are salted and I don't like him to have a lot, and he needs to be hungry for dinner in two and a half hours too. </p>
<p>Upstairs we went for our usual quiet activities in my bedroom... the farm and the camper of his Dad's, and a bit of time with the Lego. But mostly he used three little firemen from Brynnie's old toys, and put out fires, and had them climbing up on the farm to work on it. </p>
<p>When he heard his dad coming up for him at 6:15 he ran into my arms, but was perfectly happy to head for home not too much later. I suggested we walk home so that he got some more active exercise today; we ran fast for a good long block, and then spent the rest of the walk checking out the cars on the freeway, finding two! pennies, which he carried carefully home clutched in his left hand, looking to see if the dog he saw just once, months ago! was in the window, and confirming that Lily was not in her shop. </p>
<p>Bryn was waiting at their window for us to appear and scooted down to take Riku from me. He gave me kisses and a big hug and off he went with his dinner with Daddy and Mommy, saying he would see me tomorrow.</p>
<p>Back to the paperwork for me... although I did sit and finish off a magazine while drinking a hot cup of tea, but also got lots accomplished, including finding the emails and addresses of the two people in Japan I intend to write to... soon! </p>
<p>Left to pick Doug tonight at 11 p.m. I arrived just as his checked bag did... good timing! He is glad to be back in cool SF; even though it was very hot today, tonight it was cool enough that I threw a light jacket on. </p>
<p>Funny bits today:</p>
<p>... Riku had made Bryn and me laugh the other day, after looking at a "big mess" in a book and saying "This is not good!" He said it again today and made us smile; there is really something very funny about the way he says it "this is not goot" almost... </p>
<p>... Riku tonight, as I was holding him before leaving the house, leaned over and gave me a nice impulsive kiss on my cheek, and then another, and then another! </p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/my_day_with_amelia_and_riku_an.html">My Day with Amelia and Riku.. and a Red Letter Day!</a></h2>
								<p>This was a busy busy day and it flew by! I was out the door at 8:20 to pick Riku up for school; Bryn has his Japanese class on Wednesdays and leaves work early, so it's best if he doesn't also get there later as well. It was a very successful drop-off today as Riku walked in as happily as could be and went directly to the sticker table. I said a quick goodbye and left, leaving him with one of the younger teachers. What a relief! I only took him to school three times, I think, and the first time was really tough for him and for me, the second time better but still some tears, and then today... voila! He has been this way with Bryn all week, although there were days he would say "no school" but go in without a fuss. </p>
<p>Susan met me outside the school with Amelia and I switched her over to my car. Susan had a 9:30 appointment and I suggested she take until 12:30 for herself, as I had to be in the neighbourhood to pick up Riku at 1 p.m. </p>
<p>Amelia was awake before 6 a.m. today and her mom thought she would be ready for her nap by 10 a.m. We drove to her house, went upstairs and took enough time for Amelia to show me her Pee Wee Herman doll, and read a book with me while I ate some fruit and yogurt for breakfast. Amelia loves to take us by the hand and lead us about, and today was no exception; we wandered into her room to look at her animals, into the living room where she tried to talk me into "TV?" and some running in the hallway, which she so enjoys. </p>
<p>We picked up the stroller, and Amelia pushed it across the street to the playground. It was quite chilly there, and so I gravitated to the sunny swing area rather than the sandbox. Thank goodness Amelia was happy on the swings as there was quite a cool breeze blowing. It had already started to heat up in Potrero Hill and I couldn't believe how big the drop in temperature was on the other side of the big hill over there! Brrr! </p>
<p>AT 10:10 Amelia was in the stroller and she was sound asleep at 10:15. I walked with her around Stow Lake twice, and as it was getting busy with lots of noisy walkers, headed out on the sidewalk heading towards Ocean Beach. I turned around in time to get us back to Susan's at 12:40. Amelia slept for two and a half hours on the nose. </p>
<p>Susan was just walking over to the Panhandle to meet us.. with a full thermos of perfect hot tea for me, and a baggie of cookies for Riku and me, as well as a basket of organic blueberries, strawberries, and a box of black tea from Trader Joe's. This girl really does spoil me! </p>
<p>We planned to meet at Ocean Beach after Riku's nap, if he slept in the car. It was a bit foggy and cooler at that end of town but still seemed like a good idea. </p>
<p>At 1 p.m. I picked Riku up; I sat in the back seat with him while he gobbled up a big container of yogurt and blueberries, two cookies, a big drink of " Super Food" and a few nuts... and then he was asleep before coming within view of the big rainbow flag in the Castro District, less than a five minute drive away! I turned around and headed back towards the beach, parked there, and read for the two and a half hours that Riku napped! </p>
<p>He woke up quite groggy and even though he could see the rolling waves was not in a big hurry to get out and explore. This is such atypical behaviour for him, but he is really wiped after his long and busy morning. Riku always tells me they sang songs, and had snacks, and played with blocks, but will also say that he did not play with the children! </p>
<p>Susan and Amelia were already on the beach, so after a bit Riku was ready to join them. I snuggled him up in a big towel, carried him down and he sat cozied up to me for about ten minutes. Amelia wanted to sit on my other leg so much and get snuggled and covered with the blanket too, but Riku would have none of it. Susan, however, had a kite with her, with a nice big Canadian flag on it!, and Riku finally decided he would like to get up and see it. Amelia took the opportunity to take the towel, and cuddle up on her Mommy's lap for a few minutes. She too seemed sleep despite her long morning nap. I had gotten out of the car earlier and was amazed to see Amelia just sitting on the blanket with her mom, and not running about. Amelia is not a child who sits long willingly very often! </p>
<p>True to form though she was up, helping to fly the kite, trying to entice Riku to chase the gulls, and finally getting all of us to hold hands and run down the beach quite a distance. Susan let both children hold the kite which was very brave of her as she had to catch it twice as they let go of the handle! Riku was happy sitting with a pail and shovel too for a while, his favourite thing to do on the beach. We must get out as often as we can to some of the area beaches, as September will be here too soon and the opportunity will be gone. </p>
<p>We got home about 5:30 and I phoned to ask Akane if she would like to come over for dinner; that sounded "very nice" to her so I quickly cooked up some pasta, added some homemade tomato sauce, made Doug a green salad with the last of the greens, and cooked up spinach with pine nuts and garlic for Akane, Riku, and me. Riku had some udon noodle soup with carrots, tofu, some spinach and leftover broccoli bits from his lunch. Akane fed him while he was drawing, and then I took over when we all sat down to eat. Riku had a good appetite and ate more than I expected he would. And for dessert we all had Devon custard with some of the fresh strawberries from Susan. Yum! </p>
<p>I popped Riku in the tub right after dinner, as Akane is still having trouble lifting him, and Riku decided he would put "all the toys" in the tub! It was quite full when this was done but he was so happy playing with the stick-on letters (I spelled out Riku Dyment on the side of the tub which pleased Riku very much), and Robin, and the tubs with holes in them, and three boats too! </p>
<p>Bryn had been at work late tonight, and not at his class after all, so he came in while Riku was still in the tub. Riku was looking a little uncomfortable in the tub and both Bryn and I suspected he might have to have a BM. He denied it, and Bryn told him he could get out or we could put a diaper on him, but he said "no" so we let him be. Alone with him a few minutes later, I saw him raise his eyebrows and he said "uh oh!" and I quickly pulled him out and sat him on the toilet, where he had his first BM on the toilet! It may be the last for a while but we shall see. He was looking a little worried about it all, but broke into big smiles when we all clapped and congratulated him. I had bought a toy tractor and hay wagon in Japan for this very event and Riku was a very happy boy with his newest toy. </p>
<p>I got him into his clothes and ready to go home and then we sat on the sofa reading while Akane and Bryn played their first game of Sudoku, the Japanese number game played on the computer. Riku was a tired little fellow when they left at 8:30 and I didn't have my goodnight phone call from him, as I had big hugs and kisses so soon before his bedtime. </p>
<p>I cleaned up the tub and the kitchen, got the garbage and recycling ready for Doug, who had gone over to Safeway for yogurt and bananas, and was ready to sit in bed with a hot cup of tea watching a taped video with Doug when he returned. Of course, after this busy day I fell asleep about half way through the hour show. Doug had to fill me in on who did what when, while I washed and brushed my teeth. I think I read two pages of my new book (a detective story set in Cambridge) before falling asleep.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/thursday_already.html">Thursday... Already!</a></h2>
								<p>My, how this week has flown by! I had the morning to continue on with my never-ending paper work, but didn't get much accomplished once again. Candy called and we had a nice long chat, catching up on news of Michael, and my notes from Japan, and our lives in general. Glenn called on Skype but I had a terrible time with my voice bouncing back at me, so gave up, leaving he and Doug to try to solve the problem. </p>
<p>I had two newspapers to read this morning as I dashed out yesterday morning before reading it. I enjoy this time with the paper but it does eat up my morning at times. </p>
<p>Doug came with me today to pick Riku up from school; we took a different route there to see if it was any shorter. It isn't, but it is faster, as there is less traffic. Riku was happy to see his Grandpa at the door! and came out dragging his little bag behind him. </p>
<p>He didn't want a bite to eat, didn't want anything to drink, didn't want to sing any songs, and despite my being in the back seat with him (the idea of Doug's going along was so that I could sit with him and keep him awake for a nap in the house). Giving him his "snack" while Doug drove would have made the trip home faster, but Riku was sound asleep within five minutes of leaving school. Too bad as I think he has a better quality sleep lying flat in his own bed, and not slumped in the car seat. </p>
<p>I dropped Doug at home, and drove around to a shady street in the neighbourhood. Riku slept for one and a half hours and I read. He woke still not fully rested, his eyes were rolling around, looking bleary but he wanted to come home. I was hoping he would nap an extra half hour with the car moving so Doug came out and we drove to Colma to pick up some things out there. I had hoped to connect with Susan and Amelia at Marina Green today but it was not to be. I should have driven out there after dropping Doug as the extra drive out there would have been just right timing wise. </p>
<p>Riku was quiet but happy to be with us in the car; we went to Target and he had a great time wandering up and down the toy aisles, saying "what is this" and "where did this come from?" He chose a nice big beach ball for the playground; I asked him what colour he wanted and he said "not the red one, not the blue one. Riku want the green one." </p>
<p>Doug and I had decided to have a very early dinner at "Fresh Choice", conveniently located in Colma. We both had huge plates of salad fixings, and enjoyed their mozzarella with basil and sauce pizza; the best they have ever had there. Riku had a few bites of mac' and cheese, and a couple of squares of tofu, but ate almost a whole, but quite small, cornmeal muffin. </p>
<p>He likes them as much as I do! Home at 5 p.m. for some play time upstairs. Riku is far more interested in the farm and the camper these days than in his cars, and keeps busy moving the farmer and the little people around, as well as the animals. </p>
<p>Bryn came by about 6:15 p.m. to pick him up but stayed until 7:15, working on a game of Sudoku before leaving. Meanwhile, Riku had decided we two should "come downstairs now Nana; let's roll around on the bed!" which means he wants to "wrestle" really. Today he asked "where the blankets?" as he likes me to cover him up and roll him over and then tries to do the same with me. I cover the wooden slats with pillows first, as I have visions of front teeth or a small head bashing on them as he rolls very quickly about on his bed, laughing out loud and shrieking away. What a funny little boy he is!</p>
<p>I don't like to send him home all riled up, and it surprises me how quickly he will calm down. He put the rubber rings onto the five coloured sets, all correctly done, and then he did ask for all of his trucks and car baskets to be put up on the bed. "Too heavy, Nana do it!" although he struggled and succeeded in getting the smaller basket with the wooden cars in it up himself. We were busy doing that when Bryn came in to collect him. Riku automatically "throws" himself into my arms to delay his leaving for a minute, but it's all done as a joke. </p>
<p>We have been practicing saying his full name and he will say "Riku Dyment" 9 times out of ten. The other one he says he is two! </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a taped British mystery movie, worked on some emails, and went off to bed at 11:30. </p>
<p>My 901 photos arrived today! so I have that sorting job ahead of me on the weekend.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/no_biting_no_hitting_no_pushin.html">No Biting, No Hitting, No Pushing, No Licking!</a></h2>
								<p>I woke this morning with a very sore shoulder; the kind that makes you wince when you turn your neck. I must have slept on it in a strange way, although was not aware of doing so in the night. That led to a low grade headache, so I started my day off with a particularly long and hot shower. </p>
<p>I answered some emails, sat and enjoyed my big mug of hot chocolate while reading the paper and then got to work on my paperwork. Bryn called to ask if Doug could help him out with the motor scooter he bought in Vietnam, with the intention of selling it here. Doug agreed to go over, and I agreed to have Riku while they worked on it. It is always so wonderful to see Riku's big smile, and he was ready to go right upstairs to the castle, farm, and blocks. Bryn had brought their laundry over as well; he started the first load and I continued on with it during the day. </p>
<p>Riku was obviously tired; I had come downstairs for some strawberries for him and when I went back up he was lying on his side on the carpet, holding onto one of the firemen figures, but not playing with it. He had a very loose and smelly BM, and seemed just slightly out of sorts, not like Riku at all. I called to see if I could put him down for a nap. Bryn said that was fine; ten minutes later Riku was sound asleep with "many animals!" and the ocean sound blocking out the neighbour's barking dog. He slept for an hour and a half. </p>
<p>Doug and I had plans to go to a double feature, but with my neck so sore I decided against it. I thought if I took a muscle relaxant I would sleep through the movies, and if I didn't I would sit there totally aware of holding my neck up and straight to see two movies. I decided instead to stay home and really work on my files and then perhaps get to the photo order as the last of the three packages came in this morning. </p>
<p>Ah, how plans change. Bryn asked if I would like Riku for an extra hour while he went home to do some work. He was off to play ping-pong at a club at 1:30 so would pick him up before then. At 1:35 he called to say that Akane wasn' t feeling well and would come over to work on the laundry and be here with Riku. Of course it is impossible for me to ignore Riku but he was happy to sit on the bed in his room playing with the wooden blocks, his cars, trucks, trains, etc. while his mommy watched him, and then they both sat at the table drawing. Riku is amazing! First he drew some circles and coloured them in carefully, and then Akane drew a flower, an orange, and a strawberry. Riku took a marker and very meticulously filled them in, hardly moving outside the lines at all! It would have been hard to believe if I hadn't seen it myself. He had such a look of concentration on his face as he did this; a half hour later he scribbled all over the page but you can still see his previous careful work. Wow! </p>
<p>Akane folded the laundry as I took it in to her in the bedroom, which allowed me to continue work on the stack in the dining room. I have been throwing out lots of paper and the recycling bin will be full this week. What takes me so long with this process is that I clip out so many different things of interest to me, as I go through all my magazines and the paper. I end up with recipes, interesting sounding books for the various children and for me, health tips with herbs, vitamins, food, etc., all the financial statements that come in (and they have been piling up since before Kelly's visit with the children in March!), photos from others, so many letters to answer, cards to send out, interesting websites to add to my list, articles to pass on to mostly Susan, but also Kelly or my sisters, and this time paraphernalia from Japan and the trip from Vancouver to Las Vegas, and back to SF. And then there are the photos! ... and interesting sounding restaurants in the Bay area (not that we are going out to eat much these days, but one day... ), and crafts for children... and on and on it goes. At least I have the good sense to recognize that I am not going to make the potato chip cookies or the double chocolate chip cookies so tossed the recipes out for those; I must have been very hungry when I went through that particular magazine. I got lots done, despite my favourite little diversion in the house. </p>
<p>Bryn came by at 3 p.m. and sat down to play Sudoku for a bit with Akane. Riku and I had some time together on the sofa to read several books; a cuddle is always a pleasure. I made Akane and Bryn a toasted tomato sandwich before they left for home at 4:30, and after they left made a cup of tea, sat and read a magazine. </p>
<p>I had offered to babysit Amelia early tonight so that Susan and Kevin could get out to an early dinner at "Suppenkuche" (our gift to Kevin for his birthday in March and one of his favourite places to eat in the city)followed by a movie. Doug had gone to the movies, which were out at 5:15, and handily, Kevin was in the neighbourhood with Amelia, at a baby shower. He came by to pick me up just as I finished my tea. I sat with Amelia in the back seat of the car and we chatted about her day; she had escaped from an enthusiastic puppy at the shower by going into his kennel and shutting the door! </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin left the house about 5:30 and I fed Amelia immediately. She was a hungry girl and ate every bite of her mac' and cheese, sliced carrots, a spinach/brown rice dish and then amazingly, blue corn chips dipped into a delicious home made guacamole, licking it off the chip and redipping! It was very funny to see, as she really enjoyed the whole process. Dessert was most of the fruit that Susan had put out for her and lots of water. </p>
<p>Doug played with her in the living room while I ran her bath. Amelia is so smart and knows that tuck-in follows her tub so she wasn't at all anxious to stop playing with Doug. They had been reading, then when I went she clung to his neck and hung on for dear life! Boy, talk about feeling like the Grinch! </p>
<p>Amelia enjoys her tub though and she had a nice warm relaxing time with her two babies; after washing Amelia's hair she had me pretend to wash both babies' hair too. I took a darling photo of her (below). </p>
<p>After her PJs were on, Amelia ran in to see Doug again (of course!) and had both of us lifting our legs in the air from our sitting position on the sofa. She would raise Doug's leg up as best she could, groaning away, and then doing the same with his other leg, before commanding me to do the same. What a girl! At one point, Doug lifted her high in the air holding on to her with his lower legs, which she quite enjoyed, wanting him to do it over and over again. </p>
<p>At 7:30 it was time for a little girl to go to bed. She whimpered a little bit, but we read two stories on her chair, had some snuggle time with songs, and she was a heavy tired girl when I put her in the crib. Amelia did stand up when I stopped stroking her back and singing; I sang another couple of songs until she was drifting and left the room. Immediately, with the creaking floorboard outside her room, she awoke and back in I went. This time I told her that it was sleepy time, that she was to stay lying down, with her monkey and her horse, and left. </p>
<p>I was walking down the hall to the living room when she cried out, but I kept walking until I was with Doug. He had a movie all set up for us, and I stood waiting to hear how Amelia was .... and there wasn't a peep! Amazing when this happens! We watched a DVD Susan and Kevin had rented "Hotel Rwanda" which was not a movie I could sleep through; it was quite grueling yet compelling and hard not to want to see what happens... it's a good movie that keeps me awake in a dark room at night. </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin came in just past 10:30 when we were fifteen minutes from the end of it. We left with DVD in hand to finish watching at home, which we did. Doug also put on the clips included with the movie... an interview with the real manager of the hotel, visits to the burial sites and memorial halls, and interviews with the writer and director of the film as well. I did fall asleep through the last of these, washed, and read until almost 1 a.m. </p>
<p>p.s. Oh! The heading! Today out of the blue Riku mentioned that he had bitten Amelia. This happened about two plus weeks ago. I said yes, that he had made Amelia cry. His response... "no biting, no hitting, no pushing, no licking"! ... and then he licked me! I licked him right back; it is funny after all, although maybe not something we want to encourage exactly but we made each other laugh. Riku often ends something like this by saying "That funny. Nana laughing."</p>
<p>And one more note; Bryn told me today that he had allowed Riku to watch the beginning portion of one of the Star War movies (I believe). Riku was quite taken with it, and when it had been turned off (the rest is too violent) Riku asked "Watch just the beginning portion?"</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/a_quiet_sunday_at_home_mostly.html">A Quiet Sunday at Home... Mostly</a></h2>
								<p>I slept until 8:15 this morning! Reading until just before 1 a.m. helped I guess. Went down to check my email before showering, and found an email from Susan saying that Amelia had slept from her tuck-in at 8 p.m. until 5:30 this morning,  a wonderful long nine hour stretch for Amelia! Susan thinks I am a miracle worker and wants me to come and tuck Amelia in every night for two weeks until she thinks that's how Amelia thinks her nights should go. What lovely news to waken to! Of course it might have been a fluke but at least Susan and Kevin had a good long stretch of sleep themselves. </p>
<p>Bryn sent out an IM saying Riku was still asleep at 8:20! Maybe there was something in the air last night! Bryn thinks it may have had something to do with the fact that Akane was still in bed with him. We chatted for a bit and then Brynnie started a chat as well, and was so amusing; he made me laugh out loud several times. When I put up a self-portrait of his from Cambridge I asked if he knew where it was taken. He instantly replied "England". When I commented on how impressed I was with his memory (it was five years ago!) he said ""grade A for the memory box!". He also said he missed me a lot, which was very nice to hear from my boy. After a bit he invited Uncle Bryn in, and then Caillie joined us, and Akane came in as well! Kelly was on for a bit with us so we had quite a conversation going on! Both children were sending me "nudges" which are very funny, and I learned how to do it too. </p>
<p>Akane asked if Doug and I would like to join them for breakfast as Bryn was cooking up hash browns, eggs, toast, juice and tea, but Doug was eating when the invitation came in. Too bad. Doug always eats very soon after waking though so I didn't even get to make him breakfast on his birthday; by the time I had showered and come downstairs he had finished eating. </p>
<p>Gail called to fill me in on their trip to Bella Coola, so agreed to call me back at 10:30 after both of us had showered. I just made it! She and Tom had a wonderful trip with so many adventures. They saw a black bear with her three cubs, walking across a road, stayed at a gorgeous hotel with wonderful food... tofu! for appetizers every night! They also saw petroglyphs, after walking up a moutain with a local native guide, and spent two not terribly comfortable nights sleeping in airplane-like seats on the boat up the coast. She took lots of photos and I sure do wish they were digital so we could see them in an online album! </p>
<p>Elizabeth Michels also called to see if my flight for San Diego was booked; I thought Doug had booked it yesterday, as he found a good flight for me out of SF but he hadn't. He did so immediately though and I will be going August the 4th very early in the morning, and returning home on the 8th. Should be lots of fun and we had promised to spend some time together every year. This will be two out of two, so we're on track! We're hoping Ellen will join us as she did last year, but she has been flitting about to various places all summer... Oregon, Italy, Lake Tahoe, and Santa Cruz, that she may be "tripped" out! </p>
<p>I spent the rest of my day working on... the paperwork! of course and actually feel I am close to finishing it up. Of course, the work will not be over when the pile is sorted as then I have to sit down and write a dozen or more letters but the hard part will be over at least. </p>
<p>Doug was busy working on a PEA project he had wanted to do for some time, so we both decided that a full day at home would suit us both. At 4 p.m. I took a tea break and went upstairs to watch a taped Oprah and sort through the 901 photos I ordered from Kodakgallery. I had started to iron Riku's little shirts once that was finished when who burst into the room but Riku Dyment himself. </p>
<p>Bryn had called not long before to see if I wanted to go over to their place to babysit him, while they go out for dinner at a friend's, but I suggested Riku coming over to us instead as I wanted to water the garden and have dinner at home. Riku and I sat upstairs reading books and playing with the castle that Doug built two days ago; it has mostly been demolished but Riku is happy to get Brynnie's four tiny firemen and put out the fires that seem to be the biggest plague of this particular castle. </p>
<p>While reading one book, which has a cover of a little boy getting into mischief by pulling on the toilet paper roll, Riku pointed and said looking serious, "Mommy angry" and then told me once again that he had "put chopsticks down the drain in kitchen. Mommy, Daddy angry". Bryn says he says that a couple of times a day; guess he won't be doing that again! Later on at the dinner table, Riku pretended to be angry by banging his fists on the table, but with the biggest grin you ever saw. He asked me to be angry so I pounded my fists on the table. "Grandpa be angry" said Riku, and Doug had the best reaction from Riku, as he not only banged his fists on the table but made an angry face which made Riku laugh so hard out loud. Of course he wanted it repeated over again. </p>
<p>We did water the garden, and emptied out some of the pool water as well. Riku sprayed my windows with the spray bottle, and checked out a dead fly very carefully. It had died on my windowsill inside the house, so I carried it out on a piece of paper so Riku could see it more easily. He was very interested, looking at it with his nose almost touching, and when he went over later on to see it, it was gone! He asked "where that dead fly go?" and I told him that maybe the wind had blown it away. Riku looked up and said "I think that fly in sky now." Perhaps. <br />
 <br />
I gave Riku a big bowl of oatmeal with strawberries and blueberries for his dinner and an hour later gave him a not-too-hard boiled egg and a half a tomato cut into cubes. He ate all but a bite of both of these. Nice to see his appetite back after yesterday; Bryn says he ate a good breakfast too. </p>
<p>I left the house with Riku in his stroller, as he was an obviously tired boy and I needed to get him into bed asap. We arrived home at 8 p.m., I put him on the toilet, got him into his pj's, brushed his teeth, washed his face, hands, neck, and feet to freshen him up, and read one story. It was all he could do to keep his eyes open so I was very glad he chose a short bunny book for tonight. He was sound asleep at 8:30, later than I would have liked him in bed as he had only a one hour nap today. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane home from Brent's close to 11 p.m. They had a delicious dinner and Akane said it was very relaxing for her. Bryn dropped me at home, Doug was still up, I checked email, and off we went to bed.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/monday_a_lovely_start_to_my_we.html">Monday, a Lovely Start to My Week</a></h2>
								<p>Had a nice long lie-in again this morning; I slept until 7:45, showered immediately, changed the bedding, and struggled downstairs with a very full laundry basket. Got my first load in, answered some emails, made up the bed, and was them more than ready for an egg, toast, and my hot chocolate. </p>
<p>I should have gotten straight to work on the last of the paper work but instead started copying photos of Riku from Kelly and the children's visit here in March. This was a lot of work as it takes forever to place that many photos in the right spot in the new album. I helped Doug with a PEA project of his, reading him pages of numbers to slot in on the computer, and then he helped me put the photos in the right places... two hours of this. </p>
<p>However, in between, I was IM'ing with Kelly as she started working with the children on their own photo albums today. Myk' and Bry' were to be there with them for the "class", from 9-12 each day this week. Bryn and Caillie cropped and placed their photos, decorated their pages, and did some journalling as well. They went on to do two more pages and will finish journalling those before continuing on tomorrow morning. Myk' and Bry' got home in time to do two pages as well. Kelly sent me files through email of the finished products and they all did such great work on their pages! Can't wait to see them finished in person this September! How they will love having these when they are older. Lucky kids. </p>
<p>Gail called briefly with the good news that her computer problem is not a major one, thank goodness, and she may be up and running tomorrow when the new power supply comes in. </p>
<p>I had thought I would be taking Riku out for a morning trip to the playground but hadn't heard from Akane. When I called at 11:30 she was just getting his lunch ready and thought he wasn't going to be ready for his nap very soon. However, by 12:25 I hadn't heard from her, and Bryn thought they might be sleeping. He was right, and Riku napped for two and a half hours! With no nap yesterday and an early rising this morning, I am sure he is making up for lost sleep. This worked out so well for him, as an earlier nap is always better than a later afternoon one, and for me as well as I continued on with my photo work while Doug had the time to help. </p>
<p>At 4 p.m. I picked up a rested and happy little fellow and off we walked to the playground, pushing the stroller together. We had just sat down in the nice warm sand in the sandbox when Susan and Amelia arrived from Berkeley. Perfect timing and we had hoped this might work out! Riku and Amelia were happy to play together; both were rested and ran up and down the ramp, holding hands at times, climbing up and down in the little playhouse, playing on the riding toys, and in the sandbox. It was a lovely warm sunny day at the playground, until just before we left when it started to cool down. </p>
<p>Yvonne and Diego were there too so the three children had some time together. Amelia had spend the evening with Diego at his house last night, and was delighted to see him again. A black and white cat was running around the playground and of course the children were running after it! Riku snacked on some yogurt and grapes when we first got there; his nose was running and I managed to get him to drink almost a full container of water by the time we left. </p>
<p>Doug walked over at 5:15 and helped entertain the children, lifting them up and down the steps on the playhouse and keeping track of Amelia who is a fast mover! I had suggested to Akane when I left that she join us before six so she had a little fresh air and a walk, and I was so pleased when she showed up. Riku was too and went running up to her for a hug. Susan and Amelia left just as she arrived, but Bryn arrived just after 6 p.m. and we hung around watching Riku interact with three little girls who were tumbling about near the slide. He is a director and was telling the boys at the top of the slide to "move, move!" Riku had lots of slides down too though and had a fun and busy two and a half hours there. </p>
<p>We all walked home together and ended up having a very nice dinner there too; Akane cooked up some pasta, and made a delicious salad of mixed greens, blue cheese, apple slices, and a very nice vinaigrette. Riku competently sprinkled cheese on all of our dishes of pasta, helped himself to a little as well, and ate a very good sized portion of the pasta. He had answered "yes" when Bryn asked him on the way home if he was hungry and he obviously was. I was also very happy to see him drink a good sized serving of "super food" and then a glass of orange juice as well. </p>
<p>Riku entertained us at dinner with some songs; Bryn heard him singing "Itsy Bitsy Spider" a couple of days ago, complete with action, and had assumed I had taught it to him. I have sung the song a lot, and he did know the words, but we realized that the actions had come from school, as do the ones for "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star". I hadn't taught him that one at all, so he learned a lot during those three weeks! He did go over a few of the nursery rhymes he knows as well; he is getting better and better at filling in more and more of the works himself. </p>
<p>While Akane was getting dinner ready, I gave Riku a fairly quick bath, but it was enough to relax him, and slow him down for the evening. He likes to be wrapped in a big towel and carried "like a baby" these days. He does this for his Mom and Dad too which I hadn't known about. It is funny to see as he lays back so quietly and lets us admire the sweet baby I was holding. It must feel awfully comforting to be held like this. Riku also likes to be kept covered up after his tub, and so when I am putting his lotion on, I just uncover one limb at a time, as when having a massage. </p>
<p>Doug and I were completely out of staple foods in the house, milk, my soy milk, bread, eggs, etc. that we had planned to go to "Rainbow" after dropping Riku off at home. Instead I helped dry the dishes while  Doug read two books to Riku on his bed. The little guy was fading although still paying very close attention to the books he was listening to. </p>
<p>Bryn was off to ping pong at 8:30, so we all said goodnight to Riku, and Brent dropped us off at home before their ping pong game. Doug and I dashed to the store, having just enough time to pick up the few things we needed and some organic grapes and peaches for Riku. </p>
<p>Home, tea, and an hour of a taped British detective show we enjoy so much, based on novels by Elizabeth George. </p>
<p>Have had three very amusing emails from Uncle Frank the past two days in reference to the Flylady pieces I have finally started sending out again! He makes me laugh out loud. And on that note, I shall head up to bed. </p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/not_yet_riku_busy_drawing.html">"Not Yet. Riku Busy Drawing"</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn dropped Riku off at 9 a.m. today. I was upstairs in our room, putting clothes away and ironing the last of Bryn's shirts. Riku came barrelling into the room with his big smile; I hadn't heard the doorbell. He was happy to stay upstairs playing, while I worked away. While ironing I turned on the TV for the very first time ever when Riku was here, and he watched the last five minutes of Barney; the children were sharing snacks and learning to hop, so he enjoyed it very much. He had a big grin on his face when I hopped too! Sesame Street was on next so he saw Big Bird and his Granny Bird eating cookies and sharing with Cookie Monster. When I turned the TV off, he said "more TV" but I had finished ironing and it was time to head downstairs for some breakfast.  </p>
<p>Riku sat drawing at the table while eating a very good-sized portion of porridge with fresh strawberries, and some fresh orange juice. I was glancing at the paper while he drew, but pointed out some cars that had been in an accident. This was interesting, and he asked "What else in there?" so we had a look. Also on the front page was a building under construction, and on the next page an older boy eating an ice cream cone, and then a photo of a plane that had crashed into a house, some stuffed animals, and finally a table. I got a piece of paper and we made Riku his own paper; I did the cutting and Riku did the gluing. It turned out very well, he looked at it several times during the day, showed it to his Grandpa, and insisted taking it home with him too.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/a_visit_to_walnut_creek.html">A Visit to Walnut Creek</a></h2>
								<p>A few weeks ago, I came across an article on two interesting children's museums and sent it to Susan. Last night she suggested we take the children to one of them today, and so we did. Riku arrived at 9 a.m. and I was busy making up lunches for Doug (who had decided to join us after looking at their Web site), Riku, and me. I also made up some breakfast for Riku to eat in the car, so it was a busy hour or so. Riku wanted to play, but Doug was showering and I was busy in the kitchen; I realized Riku was being very quiet, and peeked in to see him sitting on the sofa going through all his books. He was there for at least fifteen minutes, with not a peep out of him. Extraordinary! </p>
<p>Akane called with some very good news; the results of the amniocentesis are back and all is looking very well for a healthy baby, and it is now confirmed that this a girl! Akane and Bryn are both thrilled, as are we of course! </p>
<p>We left later than I had hoped, at 10 a.m. I sat in the back with Riku, as usual, feeding him cereal and looking at books with him. He was fading fast though, so I rolled down the windows and he was fast asleep in minutes. He only slept for thirty-five minutes, waking soon after we arrived at the Lindsay Wildlife Museum in Walnut Creek. Doug and I sat reading in the car for about ten minutes until he awoke.</p>
<p>Originally Susan had suggested we take her car, but we decided that if one child needed more sleep the other one wouldn't necessarily be quiet enough for this to happen. For now, two cars seemed like the better idea.  </p>
<p>Once in the museum, Riku took great pleasure in the little red stamp they put on all our hands. He showed it off several times over the course of the day with him and wanted to see ours too. Funny how these little things mean so much to children at this age. We watched two very active squirrels in cages when we first went in, but Riku soon spotted two big floor puzzles and off he went to do those. Amelia and Susan had arrived earlier, and after Amelia's thirty-five minute sleep, joined Riku working on the puzzles.</p>
<p>From then on the children just explored whatever took their fancy. One very popular item was a giant stuffed animal toy of a Bald Eagle. Both children were wild about him and spent a lot of time running around him, hiding under his wings, and hugging him. It was really cute to watch. They were far less interested in the live animals all around them although did stop now and then to watch for a few minutes. They found a little side room where they could run, and run they did, chasing one another and shrieking not too loudly. </p>
<p>The museum is set on a huge piece of property, quite lovely and well kept-up. There were picnic tables, lots of grass, a playground, and even a pool (which we didn't know about). No food is available, which is why we had packed lunches. Riku was hungry, despite his runny nose, and ate a very large portion of mac' and cheese with veggies, grapes and strawberries, and some cookies and juice. Amelia sat and ate her lunch too, at Susan's insistence, as she was ready to head off to the playground asap. </p>
<p>While the adults sat and enjoyed the goodies Susan had provided... pain au chocolat!, pastries, and chocolate bars from Canada (which we resisted only because there wasn't room for them!) and drinking the Cokes Doug had packed in ice, Amelia and Riku wandered off on their own. It was so cute to see; usually Amelia is taking Riku's hand, and is quite put out when he refuses to go along with it, but today Riku did the reaching out to her, as well as holding her around the middle while standing in front of her! Amelia was feeling a mite independent today, and didn't always choose to let him hold her hand. </p>
<p>Because the area was so wide open and huge we let them wander off a considerable distance. They spent quite a bit of time poking around near a big tree, Riku finding sticks and Amelia following suit, and then strolling off hand in hand back toward the museum. They came back when we called, though, and then we saw Riku putting something down the front of Amelia's top. I went over to see what it was as we wondered if they were sticks!, but no, it was grass that he was picking! Amelia didn't mind a bit, as mostly it was falling down the top and out the bottom of it. </p>
<p>We tidied up our table and went bck into the museum to watch the mountain lion being fed. It was a little too graphic for me; Doug had seen it from the very beginning, when the food was hidden in a box and hung from an overhead rafter for the mountain lion to attack. We got there in time to see the end of his tearing through the box to discover a large rat, which he started to nibble on, beginning at the head. The policy at this museum is not to feed live animals to the animals, but the volunteer explained to us that even though the "prey" was dead, the lion would eat the head first... in the wild it could do some damage to the lion if still live. The children lost interest fairly quickly and went back to the stuffed, giant eagle. Amelia kept saying "playground?" so off we went; Doug joined us about fifteen minutes later, very enthusiastic about all he had learned and seen. </p>
<p>Riku and Amelia kept busy with the swings (Amelia) and the sandbox (Riku), patting dogs and riding a mini-carousel. Both children were tired though and after Riku cried when the buckets he was using were taken away by their owners I realized he was very tired. We drove into Walnut Creek for a few minutes, as Doug wanted to go to a bookstore, and while Riku and I sat in the car reading all the books I had taken along, Riku spotted many people walking by eating ice-cream. I told him to ask Grandpa for some when he came back and he did. Doug walked up to the car and Riku said "Grandpa, buy ice-cream!" Doug was happy to oblige and went looking for the shop. I had asked Riku if he would like strawberry or vanilla and he said "vanilla" and ate every bite of a quite large container of it! "This is cold!" he said and pulled the little cotton blanket over himself. Five minutes later, after pulling away, he was sound asleep. Doug parked the car in a shady spot near the house and walked home. I was happy to sit and read for the hour extra he slept. Riku did waken once crying, so I knew he wasn't ready to waken so I drove around the block a few times and he was out again for the duration. </p>
<p>When he awoke he was his happy little self. As soon as we came in, Riku went right out into the garden, squirting the windows with a watering bottle, wandering about picking up sticks, and enjoying the cooler air here I'm sure; it was hot in Walnut Creek! </p>
<p>We had a little snack of fruit and a cookie or two, and sat reading lots of books. Riku never ever tires of this, snuggles right up against me on the sofa, asking lots of questions about what is going on. </p>
<p>Bryn came by at 7 p.m. to pick Riku up. Riku comes running to me, to "escape" his daddy taking him home, but is always fine, waving happily to me, once he has his shoes on and is heading downstairs. </p>
<p>Bryn had good news at work as well as he has a new boss, who looks promising.</p>
<p>Jody called just as I tidied up from the day, and we had a long chat. She has guests in the B&B and now that the weather is improving is hoping that there will be more guests the rest of the summer. The cold and rainy days have kept visitors to a minimum.  </p>
<p>I had eaten enough today that I wasn't at all hungry for dinner, so Doug had a small commercial burrito, I made tea, and we went upstairs to finish watching the last of the "Games of the Mind" DVD we started watching at Bryn's and Akane's last night. I stayed awake for all of it, as they are really well done and interesting, came downstairs and wrote a couple of emails, and turned off the light too late again, at 12:35. </p>
<p>... birthday card from Geraldine today.  </p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/something_like_that.html">"Something Like That"</a></h2>
								<p>I was sound asleep at 7:30 this morning, dreaming about putting a big vase in the corner of a vestibule, and having it fall, when the phone rang and got me out of the fix I was in! It was Judith, calling from Delaware; I had told her I am always up by 7 a.m. and she took me at my word. Normally, that is a good rule of thumb... </p>
<p>Judith has been very busy travelling... out to Vancouver to attend a delayed wedding reception for her youngest son Daniel, and his wife, who were married in Mexico a few months ago. And she is on her way to Prague and the Swiss Alps soon, so it was a good time to catch up with all our news. </p>
<p>Riku arrived at 9:15, big smile in place, and he said "hello", answered "yes" very clearly to Judith's questions, and said a very nice "buh bye" to her too. It sure would be fun to share my grandson with all of my friends one day! </p>
<p>I hadn't showered, so we went right upstairs. "Riku help" make my bed, straightening the covers on his side and then was quite happy sitting on the bed watching a little TV while I took a quick shower. I had put the farm up on the bed as well, so he could putter with it. He wasn't that thrilled when I turned the TV off immediately after I dressed. He did see Barney and some children making a big castle out of "many boxes!" though, so it was no doubt lots of fun for him to watch. </p>
<p>We came down for his breakfast, and mine too. Riku had hot cereal with fresh peaches, and two slices of "bacon", while I ate my one egg, two pieces of toast, and "bacon" as well as my hot chocolate. Oh, Riku had two tiny cups of hot chocolate too, which he insisted on calling "hot sholacolate tea"! He had a side dish of strawberries and grapes as well. </p>
<p>Riku was coughing a lot today, much more than yesterday, so I decided to pass on taking him to Ocean Beach to join Susan and Amelia. Too bad, as Susan said later it was one of the warmest days she had ever spent there. It can be windy, though, and I didn't want to take the chance. Akane said he had a hard time sleeping last night with the coughing, so I was glad I hadn't taken the chance. </p>
<p>Riku had an early nap today; three times this week he has slept in the late morning. He wanted "allbody" in bed with him again today, but as soon as he is asleep I pulled away all but the monkey, as he gets too warm when he is sleeping. He slept an hour and a half and was a happy fellow when he woke. </p>
<p>Riku ate a very good lunch for someone who isn't feeling that well (his nose is still running today); he polished off a good sized bowl of mac' and cheese with spinach, mushrooms, and lots of tomatoes added to it. Later on I made him some fresh orange juice; he ate more fresh fruit and four small cookies (he likes ginger snaps the best). </p>
<p>We had a busy day at home. We sat at the table while he drew; he played with the buttons for the first time in a long long time, used the peg board, which has been put aside for some time; he sat on the chesterfield and quietly leafed through his living room books; and we looked at his "favourites" on the computer: Chudleigh the dog from the greeting card service I use, and a funny one he used to see a lot when his parents were still living here (and I rediscovered the other day). RIku always takes time to stop and look at the photos on the computer screen as they go by. </p>
<p>Mid-afternoon, he got really really silly! He knocked all of the bears off the settle, and then came in saying "Oh, there is really big mess in there!" When I asked who made that big mess he 'fessed up by saying "Riku make that big mess!" When he was putting the buttons back in the button box, he noticed a little strip of paper that had been torn off (he did this long ago). He asked "Who tore this paper off" and when I turned the question back to him his reply was "Auntie Kelly did that!" I laughed out loud, as it was the last thing I expected him to say. </p>
<p>Akane had a doctor's appointment today, and she and Bryn had lunch at the studio together. At 3:30 she arrived with the stroller to pick Riku up, but sat for a bit watching him with the buttons for the second time today. As soon as he knew it was time to leave, he became a little whirlwind, running around at top speed, saying "I open all the drawers!" and opened the kitchen drawers before running into the bedroom saying "I throw bears on ground!" and threw a couple before I caught up to him. Then he dashed into the living room, throwing two stuffed animals off the stool onto the floor... <strong>crazy!</strong> but funny too. </p>
<p>I decided we would walk home with them, as we needed bananas anyway, as well as a walk. Riku and I raced two blocks down a hill to "beat" Akane and Doug who walked the more level blocks. That was enough energy for Riku to exert as he had Doug carry him on his shoulders the rest of the way home. Riku had asked me for a banana today, and we didn't have any, so he ate 3/4 of one we bought on the way back to his place. Grandpa took him up and Riku tried to convince him to stay "Grandpa stay play with Riku", shutting the door behind him and then leaning against it! I was smart enough to stay downstairs and by the time Doug arrived Riku and Akane were waving out the window at us. </p>
<p>My kitchen was a mess and I had too much to do, so instantly made tea and went upstairs to escape it all! I watched a couple of taped Oprahs and finished my second Ayelet Waldman mystery, enjoying the leisurely time reading and dozing off a bit too, ignoring the work awaiting me downstairs. Finally, at 7:30 I dragged myself downstairs, cooked up some delicious ravioli Susan had kindly bought for us last week, sat with Doug eating big bowls of it with my sauce, and then cleaned up the kitchen.</p>
<p>And here I sit... lots of photo annotating and arranging to do, and I plan to go to bed early tonight as well. Tomorrow I do nothing but letters and photos and maybe emails!</p>
<p>Oh, while Riku was drawing, I guessed that the big winding oval was a road. So I asked, "Riku, is that a road?" to which he replied "Something like that!" Blow me over! Riku makes me laugh so very often. What a sense of humour he is developing, and has been for some time. Just a lift of those dark eyebrows can make us laugh out loud. </p>
<p>... and one more sweet thing to make a note of: while napping today Riku leaned over as he was falling asleep and kissed me on my cheek, twice.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/pool_time_for_kevin.html">Pool Time.. for Kevin!</a></h2>
								<p>Today I had visions of a full day at home, doing all the things that kept me awake last night... online photo sorting, catching up with emails once more, writing letters, vacuuming... all the things I didn't get to this week. I got off to a late start, which was not a good thing, sleeping until 8:45 a.m. I had gone downstairs to Riku's room at 3 a.m. so that I could read without disturbing Doug. That did the trick as I was asleep in less than ten minutes; I should have done this an hour earlier instead of making mental lists of what needed doing! </p>
<p>I had decided to send Doug off to the Independent Book Fair on his own, and getting started at my list of chores. Instead I talked to Gail for quite a while; she suggested that the housework could wait (it has been waiting for quite some time!) and that I really should go off with Doug and enjoy some time away from the house. So, with no time for anything more than a quick shower and making the bed, I dashed off, sans breakfast! on this already hot morning. </p>
<p>I hadn't intended to buy any books, as I have more than plenty to read right here, but of course who can ignore those bargains? The book I am most anxious to read first is a non-fiction book called "War Orphan in San Francisco", about a ten-year-old Jewish girl, an only child, sent from Vienna to San Francisco on her own during WW2. After flipping through the book, I was introduced to the author who was sitting at the end of the aisle, and had a chance to chat with her for a few minutes... her father survived the war, but not her mother; she was the only child of the ten she travelled with to come to San Francisco; she stayed with a distant relative for six months and then lived in several orphanages before being reunited with her father many years later. He had kept all their correspondence during their years apart, and this is the foundation of the book. My kind of book for certain. </p>
<p>It was hot, hot, hot, and I kept to the shady spots as much as I could. I'm sure I could have found more bargains but it was just not comfortable being out there in the sun. However, Doug and I thought that we must take Riku to Yerba Buena Gardens soon, as he would so enjoy the multi-level fountain and the carousel too. Kelly and the two children spent some time there on every trip but the last one. </p>
<p>Doug had noticed an Indian restaurant on our walk to the fair, and realized it was one he had on a list to try. We haven't been eating out and so it was a treat to sit in an air-conditoned room and eat several different dishes... pakoras and samosas for me, as well as potato tikki, while Doug enjoyed a catfish wrap, dipped in spicy chickpea flour and fried. It was good... not fantastic, but worth a try for sure. </p>
<p>Off to "Trader Joe's" for soy milk, some frozen berries for Riku's cereal and my fruit bowl, and butter to mix up. There was a message from Susan saying that Kevin would like to bring Amelia over for some pool time, as she had a bit of a sunburn on her arms and needed to keep her out of the sun. I quickly emptied the pool, with Doug's help, cleaned it, and then refilled it with some warm water as well, so it wasn't too too cold for Amelia. </p>
<p>I have needed a haircut badly for more than two weeks and decided I couldn't deal with it anymore! I was lucky enough to get in to see Bing, my favourite gal, at Super Cuts in Noe Valley. Such a bargain... a $15 dollar haircut and every bit as good as some $40 plus cuts I have had lately. I felt human again! </p>
<p>Doug had gone up with me, to check out a couple of stores he rarely gets to any more, and had noticed a woman selling children's clothing and toys. She was almost giving them away... a Gap long-sleeved top with an animal on the front, tag still on, for 50 cents! which is also what she charged for three or four toys in tip-top condition. They are a bit young for Amelia and Riku but not enough that they won't have some fun with them. In fact, Doug put fresh batteries in a pull-along turtle toy, and Amelia and Riku were both taken with the little songs it sings and the blinking lights on top. I also bought a pair of pull-on jogging pants for Riku to have as a spare here, along with the top.</p>
<p>We arrived home just as Kevin and Amelia pulled up; she was just finishing off a good hour and a half nap in the car and was ready to stretch her legs... but not in the pool! Kevin did everything he could to entice her in, including getting in himself, making whale splashes, putting her on his shoulders, and soaking his head in the water, but it wasn't enough to convince Amelia.</p>
<p>Riku and Bryn showed up just a few minutes after Amelia and Kevin, and he too had zero interest in going in the pool; he did laugh at Kevin's antics though, and enjoyed getting splashed, but that was enough for him. Funny, as it was so hot out there but... who knows! </p>
<p>The children had a great time playing in the house, upstairs and downstairs. Riku sat on the bed surrounded by books, Amelia joined him, they snacked on some berries and toast, Amelia coaxed Kevin upstairs for block building, Riku joined them... and then Bryn and I went up as well. Bryn, after playing a game of Sudoku on the computer, decided to get out the wooden block set he had bought in Russia many years ago, and I found a doll for Amelia and some whistles that Riku thought were just terrific. He carried them downstairs later on, saying "These are very delicate". We cannot believe how his vocabulary is expanding every day! </p>
<p>The children were so cute running around in just their diapers. Riku was reluctant to take off his shirt, despite being too hot. His hair was wet with sweat until he took off his shirt and shorts, which thank goodness he did eventually. Amelia is repeating words so well; even words that should be difficult for her aren't. We all agree that she is one very smart little girl. It's hard to imagine at times that she is almost a year younger than Riku. They are very different personalities, of course, so it is not easy to compare them; this is a good thing! </p>
<p>Riku played with the buttons again for a bit, and the two children ran around with the push toys as well. At 6:45 both Daddies were packing up their reluctant children to go home. Riku cried a little bit and wanted me to carry him down to the car and put him in his seat too. I piled up all his things on him... a tiny car, a book, an animal, and more... and off he went. I'm sure he was happy to get home building with his daddy, and for dinner too. Bryn wrote later to say he had been using some of the blocks like dominoes and that Riku was enjoying knocking them down. That led to a discussion about whether we still had the dominoes that Bryn used as a child, doing just what he did for Riku tonight. He was all set to buy some on eBay but Doug told him he was welcome to our old set. Bryn's response? "Sweet!"</p>
<p>I cleaned up the kitchen, took the toys out of the pool (Doug helped me cover it up), and then was too hot to even think about dinner. Doug helped himself to some beans and "hot dogs" and I had a bowl of soup, reheated, just to get it out of the fridge. We also each had two pieces of delicious whole wheat bread Bryn and Akane bought for us in Japantown. Yum!</p>
<p>Doug played old songs from the early fifties, found on the computer, while I rearranged and annotated photos online beside him. He was amazed at how many songs we knew the words to, songs that were very familiar to us, after working out that we were only 6-7 years old when they were hits! Both of us had mothers who loved music, had it playing all the time, and sang too. Lucky us!</p>
<p>Off to bed... 11:20 p.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/a_quiet_but_productive_day_at.html">A Quiet but Productive Day at Home</a></h2>
								<p>Short entry today... no children around to make the day more interesting! I slept until 8:15, which was amazing in itself, but gave me a later start than I had hoped for. I showered immediately, came down and made myself an egg and two slices of the delicious bread Bryn brought over yesterday. With only one crust left, it seemed silly not to finish it off, so I did, spreading it thickly with almost-the-last of Auntie Rita's delicious grape jelly. I will be so sad when it is all gone. </p>
<p>Kelly emailed before I awoke; she and Gregg, Mykayla, and Bry', were on their way to Parry Sound to pick up Bryn and Caillie, and then all are heading for a week in the Manitoulin with Gregg's parents. Sherri and her two children are going to join them there for three days. Sherri is Kelly's friend from high school; she and her husband moved from BC to near Sudbury last fall and this will be their second visit with Kelly in the Manitoulin. It's less than a two-hour drive for them to visit there. </p>
<p>I got right to work on Riku's online album; I am copying all of the photos of him of this year, from various albums, into his main album. This way, it will be much easier, in the future, to copy just his, or Amelia's (hers is next) and not worry about missing any when I print. It is astounding, though, just how many photos I have of these children! How I love my digital camera, but am very grateful that Doug is behind the scenes, doing the uploading, cropping, and placement of them into the right albums. He also does the photos for the blogs for me; he is way behind on this, though, and just tonight got back to it. He is now finished the 2004 blogs, so has a long long way to go! </p>
<p>Whenever I needed a break from sitting or moving photos around, I took care of a little household job that needed doing. Today, I mixed two pounds of butter for our "better-butter", made Doug's second cheesecake so that he and Bryn have a little more. There wasn't a slice left after his birthday dinner and now he has a whole one to eat up... until Bryn discovers that it is here. </p>
<p>I also cleaned out the fridge, a job that has been neglected for the past two weeks. I cooked up some rhubarb to serve with Devon custard, a dessert that Doug and I are awfully fond of, and ate a lot of in England. I had it often as a child too, but served with hot Bird's custard; it's so delicious served either way. </p>
<p>Mid-afternoon, Doug went off to Safeway for yogurt and a few things on my list; I stayed home, deciding not to move out of the house today. This is not good, I know, but I really wanted the whole day at home... and got it! </p>
<p>Doug brought home four cobs of white corn, and we had it for dinner, along with some of the bits and pieces from the fridge... leftover spicy Indian garbanzo beans from lunch yesterday, a tiny bit of spinach I cooked up for me with pine nuts and olive oil (I love this!), vegetarian "sausage", and lots of raw veggies (carrots, celery, tomato, and cucumber) for me. </p>
<p>After dinner, I was surprisingly inspired to wipe down my kitchen cupboards thoroughly. Normally, I would do this tomorrow but I know it will be better to walk in tomorrow with that job done already. And perhaps it will inspire me to get the vacuum cleaner out too. The tiny, fine seeds from a tree in the garden have invaded the kitchen; the door has been open almost the entire day for the past few days, and now the inside is beginning to look like the outside. I am inclined to take the vacuum cleaner outside and suck up all the debris from around the deck at least, and maybe from the closest rocks in the garden as well! I also watered all the outside plants Susan kindly bought and planted for me two or three weeks ago. They are blooming merrily away and add some much-needed colour to the back yard and front steps. </p>
<p>Bryn called to ask if we wanted to join him and Riku at the park; Riku had had a three hour nap, and they were out for some fresh air and exercise. It was just as I was about to prepare dinner; Doug was hungry and wanted to eat a little earlier tonight. I have had so little interest in cooking lately that we have been eating later than ever before. </p>
<p>I got back to the photos, as moving a block of them takes a huge amount of time; as they get copied from one album to another, they are placed at the very bottom of the album, and moving them one at a time is very time-consuming. </p>
<p>Riku called me at 9 p.m. to say goodnight. For the first time tonight, when I said "Hello honey", he said it back to me. It is a highlight of my day to hear that little voice at his bedtime, especially on those days when I haven't seen him. He told me he is going to visit with his friend Alex tomorrow, which will be fun for him, and ended our conversation by saying a very sweet "Goodnight sweetheart", "I love you" and with a big smacky kiss at the end of it.</p>
<p>The phone call came just as I was ready for another break, so we went upstairs, me with my tea and plate of veggies, and watched a taped doo-wop gospel music special, lots of it not our favourite music, so we fast-forwarded past the ones we weren't enjoying. "The Jordanaires", Elvis' original back-up group, were on and just amazing, sounding as they always did! </p>
<p>Had a little IM time with Bryn tonight; here are some quotes from him... we explained to riku at dinner about the "new plan"<br />
Lynne says:<br />
which is?<br />
bryn says:<br />
told him that once the lights are out, there's no talking<br />
bryn says:<br />
if he talks, then mommy won't stay with him<br />
bryn says:<br />
instead, he'll get daddy... which i know isn't ideal (me being the punishment)<br />
bryn says:<br />
however, i'm fine with it<br />
bryn says:<br />
anyway, he was chattering away with akane after lights-out<br />
bryn says:<br />
so akane came out...<br />
bryn says:<br />
we gave him "one more chance"... didn't hear a peep afterward<br />
Lynne says:<br />
great!</p>
<p>Lynne says:<br />
Karyn said today that Riku looks so much like you! She thought it was his smile perhaps. Akane says more people are saying that too, although I see many of Akane's mannerisms in him lately</p>
<p>Lynne says:<br />
Today Riku helped me fold the two blankets he uses during his naps... he took one side and I took the other... he likes his room tidy.. interesting, but then so did you</p>
<p>bryn says:<br />
he helped carry stuff upstairs today<br />
bryn says:<br />
carried the banana bread up.... wanted to participate<br />
Lynne says:<br />
he is a helper for sure...<br />
Lynne says:<br />
he pulls up the chair to help cook, and today helped load up a bag with things for the baby!</p>
<p>Lynne says:<br />
he is such a special little boy<br />
bryn says:<br />
i'm glad you think so!<br />
Lynne says:<br />
yeah, me and the universe!</p>
<p>Back downstairs after the tapes tv show I came down for more photo work, but it's time for b now... 11:15 p.m.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/okay_already.html">Okay, Already!</a></h2>
								<p>Doug reminded me tonight, as he headed up to bed, that we had a pretty uneventful day around here today, and that I really could do a very short blog. So, here goes! (He's right, I know; I intended writing a short blog yesterday and it was long!)</p>
<p>Okay, got lots done today... no children though. Sad. Two days now. I'm in withdrawal, but... the kitchen looked great when I walked down this morning, nice clean counters, shining sink, so I was inspired after breakfast to get right to the vacuuming on this floor, and did indeed vacuum up some of that fluffy seed from the back deck! Filled up the bag, but at least it is not sitting ready to blow into the kitchen immediately. Cleaned two bathrooms, did all the laundry.. but no ironing as I intended. </p>
<p>Made Doug's lunch, a rare event, and he was very happy to have his cheesecake for dessert too. This was a reward for all the blog photos he worked on for me this morning. Now it's up to me to complete some of the missing blogs; some are in draft form and just need finishing up. </p>
<p>Nice quick dinner... big salad with feta cheese (yum!), and vegetable potstickers. There was even dessert tonight when Doug asked, the stewed rhubarb and cold Devon custard. It was too good for me to turn down; I don't usually eat dessert. And it was an extra fruit for me today! </p>
<p>The biggest accomplishment of the day was I finally finished sorting through that massive pile of loose papers! Halleluha! The nice tidya individual stacks are not put away yet, but it was the sifting through all the bits of paper that have collected over the past months, and months!, that were driving me crazy, and now it's done! Yahoo! </p>
<p>After that was finished I had no excuse not to sit down and write to the young mom in Japan, and to a very young daughter of a friend in Toronto too. Crossed those two items off a very long list. </p>
<p>Early this evening I decided to make an album for Riku's little friend Tomoha in Japan, rather than send her mom a dozen or so photos of the two of them. Doug helped me with the layout after I had cropped them, he did the title page with matte as well, and then the lettering too with their names on the front page, beneath a really sweet photo of the two of them. Doug is such a perfectionist that it's not hard for him to want to make sure it is done evenly or in the best position. I was more than grateful for the help! He even parcelled it up for me with lots of bubble wrap and now it's all ready to mail out tomorrow. </p>
<p>Amelia called and said "HI!" in the biggest voice tonight! It was so wonderful to chat with her; she says "uh huh" to almost every question I ask so it's always fun to hear what she may (or may not) have done today. I thought I might see her today, but Susan hadn't been at her computer after early this morning and didn't check her phone for messages either! </p>
<p>I hope to see them tomorrow; I did get lots done though so perhaps it was meant to be that I just stick with it. It's always easy to decide to play instead of work! </p>
<p>Gail is back online, thank goodness. Her computer has been down since she and Tom arrived back from a week long holiday a week ago Saturday. There are certainly fewer emails when Gail is away, although Candy has been very good lately with lots of little notes. </p>
<p>Off I go! It will be a Riku and an Amelia day tomorrow. </p>
<p>Bedtime... 11:10 p.m. Not bad!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/terrific_tuesday.html">Terrific Tuesday</a></h2>
								<p>Riku arrived early this morning, at 8:10, before I had finished drying my hair. Once I was dressed, Riku helped me make the bed; he walked in my room and said "this bed is all messy!"; it's usually made by the time he arrives but when it isn't he helps me with it. He likes me to fluff up the duvet so that it blows on him, and then he seriously pulls up the corner and straightens the side for me. He's a big helper; he very much likes to be tidy but his dad was like that too. </p>
<p>It was a busy morning once we came downstairs; I made Riku a big bowl of porridge with slivered almonds and strawberries, made myself a big bowl too, we both ate, and then it was time to pack up lunches. We had a big adventure in store for us. Doug, Riku, and I drove down to San Jose to meet up with Susan and Amelia at a fantastic fountain in the downtown area. Both children napped for an hour on the way, and Amelia was gung-ho to take off her sandals and move amongst the dozen or so water jets. Riku was content to sit on his Grandpa's lap for fifteen minutes or so, despite Amelia's encouragement to take off his sandals, take her hand, and get wet with her. I think he was still tired and needed a little more time to come 'round. </p>
<p>Eventually he did come in with us; Susan and I also had our sandals off. We all got wet, and Riku put his arms out to touch the tall sprays of water, but wasn't interested in being swung into the water as Amelia was. Riku is still coughing occasionally, although wasn't while we were there, but he is just not up to par for vigourous playing yet. It hasn't curbed his appetite at all though, as he ate a huge portion of pasta with kale and chopped tomatoes as soon as we arrived, sat happily eating grapes, polished off some custard and more berries, and drank a container of "Super Food"! ... oh, and ate a half slice of whole wheat raisin toast too, finishing off the rest on the way home. </p>
<p>The downtown area had been sectioned off for a Grand Prix race happening this weekend, so parking and driving around was a bit of a challenge. Doug went off to do the rounds of book and record stores, and I walked Riku to "The Children's Discovery Museum" while Susan drove with Amelia. This way we didn't have to move Riku's car seat. It was a fast ten-minute walk and due to the parking problems, I was there for almost a half hour before Susan and Amelia arrived. </p>
<p>What a wonderful place this was for the children. Amelia has been before but it was Riku's first time. He loved it! When we first walked in, there was a full-sized fire engine, so he explored the outside, opening the doors and panels, containing clothing and hoses, then climbed aboard steering and moving whatever switches he could see. From there he went into an ambulance; a little girl lay down on a stretcher and Riku immediately covered her up with a blanket! Perhaps he will be a paramedic or a doctor. </p>
<p>There was a TV screen with a man singing "Old MacDonald Had a Farm", the various animals appearing behind him. Was this ever a hit with him! He doesn't see these programs and I think he so enjoyed seeing a familiar song brought to life. "Big Bird" was on another screen, with Cookie Monster too and they got some time as well. It might be time to introduce him to a half hour of Sesame Street. He did see a bit last week, certainly enjoyed it, and wasn't happy when I turned it off! </p>
<p>We wandered around for about fifteen minutes, putting his hands in bubble water, watching the big children make giant bubbles, using (on his own) an old-fashioned wringer (which he quite enjoyed, getting all the water out of two t-shirts), and climbing up a big platform and looking down at all the children. </p>
<p>The biggest hit of all, though, was the water room, for children under four years of age. It contained a huge water table, which was an immediate hit! Despite having a plastic apron on, Riku got quite wet, with his enthusiasm for all the things he could do in this room. Amelia was with him in there too, and the two of them had such a great time. They could balance balls on water spouts, throw balls into a whirlpool and watch them spiral down, but spent just as much time filling up containers and dumping the water back in wherever they happened to be at the time. </p>
<p>We ended our visit here with fifteen minutes in the face painting room. Riku and I had stepped in earlier, and had seen moms carefully painting their children's faces. Amelia and Riku had different ideas; they just walked into the now-empty room, picked up brushes, dipped them into the paint, and worked away on their canvases! Oh my! Riku chose a very dark green for the left side of his face with some brights for the right. He took it very seriously, watching himself in the mirror while he worked away. Meanwhile, Amelia decided that her nostrils and mouth needed a little more colour. Susan was just howling while she watched all this going on! After a few photos Amelia was taken off to have her face washed, after which Susan did some adorable freckles, a red nose, and spotted cheeks too. She and I did a little face painting ourselves, but neither was as interesting as the children's. </p>
<p>Doug had trouble parking in order to pick Riku and me up, but we finally connected twenty minutes later than we planned. We said our goodbyes to Susan and Amelia, with Susan suggesting that we do one more major trip a week, rather than just the local playgrounds. I know how quickly the summer is going to fly by, with September coming up so quickly, so we must do this. </p>
<p>Riku napped for an hour on the way home, and walked into the house ready to play with the new baby doll I found on Sunday, a fuzzy ugly little animal creature, and his dog. He bundled them all up carefully in a blanket and carried them around the house, being such a gentle daddy to them. At one point, he handed them to me to babysit while he went off to find his Grandpa. He was cooing away, pretending to change the baby, when he came back downstairs, assuring her/him that he/she was okay. So very sweet. </p>
<p>He had two long breadsticks and a tiny piece of cheesecake; he told Doug it was yummy, when Doug told him it was yucky, pretending to take it away. Riku also broke out into "Itsy-Bitsy Spider" again, using the action for it and asked me to sing "Twinkle, Twinkle" with him too. </p>
<p>Bryn called a little later to say he was coming over early for Riku; Riku decided he would stay in his chair at the table and I could read him lots of books. Doug read through half of his new Red Train book with him, while I tidied up, and then I took over and read all of his "kitchen" books. I tried to take some of this big stack into his room, but Riku told me they stayed in the kitchen. He has living room books, the front bedroom books, his own room books, and the master bedroom books, and I guess that is how he wants it! We managed to get through about five books before his Daddy insisted that it was time to go home and play with the Domino set Doug gave him. They left about 6:30, and Doug and I had a very quick simple dinner of greens and some mac' and cheese. Doug had, of course, cheesecake for dessert. Bryn had some this morning before he left for work too! </p>
<p>I wrote a letter to Noriko tonight, the second mom I met in the park in Japan. Two down, no telling how many to go! Too many... but getting there. </p>
<p>Candy also wrote today to say she was going to be in the Falls when I am there in September. What good news! It's always more fun with someone to travel around with, especially when visiting brothers and sisters, and Uncle Frank too! </p>
<p>Elizabeth called to confirm that two queen-sized beds would be fine in one room for our trip to San Diego a week Thursday; this week too will fly by. </p>
<p>Doug and I just watched a PBS documentary on a man who chose to commit suicide, rather than face heart surgery and deal with prostate cancer; his daughter made the film and it was a little tough to watch the effect this decision had on his family, much as they understood his need to be in control of his life, and his death. </p>
<p>And that's it... bedtime at 11:19. Perhaps tonight is the night that I turn the light out before midnight and manage to get up before 8 a.m. tomorrow. </p>
<p>... a note; I mustn't close without saying that Riku called at 8:50 to say goodnight to me. He told me he was in his PJs, had had tofu for dinner, and he and his daddy had played with the dominoes... and then wished me "goodnight dolly" and blew me a kiss. I missed my call last night... Bryn was at ping pong.</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/entertaining_miss_camp_directo.html">Entertaining "Miss Camp Director"</a></h2>
								<p>Amelia came by to visit today, and we had a lovely time! Susan brought her to our house, as I hoped to get her to nap in Riku's room instead of her stroller. Even though she had been rubbing her eyes at home, she perked up and hid very well any signs of being tired once she arrived here. I was just finishing up my breakfast at 9:30 when she arrived, and at 10:15 we went upstairs together; I did my flat ironing while Amelia played with the farm for a few minutes and then watched a half hour of Sesame Street. Alison Krause was on, singing about the number four! Doug missed her, as he was in the shower at the time; too bad as we are both fans of hers. Amelia likes music, almost any music as far as I can tell, so she was swaying back and forth listening and watching. She ate some pistachios and bread sticks while we were upstairs; Amelia is a big fan of the former, and I have just stocked up with another large bag of them to keep her well supplied. </p>
<p>She sat at the table and drew in her big pad of paper, while I sat beside her and read the newspaper. Of course, the "bee" came out, and Amelia pushed it around the house, then talked Doug into going to the garden to sweep. Amelia is very good at getting people to do as she tells them. She is especially adept at getting Doug to follow her orders! When he tried to go in the house and hang his broom up, she followed him in and told him "no!"... and back out he went. He needed rescuing and I laughed when he told me! I'm not quite such a pushover; good thing too, as I have a lot to do around here, even when the children visit! Just keeping the floor tidy enough to walk on safely takes some energy and time. </p>
<p>More and more, Amelia is repeating every single word back to me; I say "oh sorry" and she says "oh sorry" back! And it goes on and on, with Amelia repeating even the most difficult words. She is astounding with these verbal skills of hers! I don't think Susan or Kevin have any idea just how smart this little girl of theirs is... or maybe they do, but are too modest to say so. </p>
<p>The goal was to get Amelia to sleep in Riku's room for her nap. Well, that's all it was... a goal. It didn't happen, although we came close, she and I. At 11 a.m. Amelia was a sleepy girl; I used all my old familiar techniques... holding her in my arms for snuggling and a few very very quiet songs, putting her down when she was relaxed, and then staying with her for a few minutes to settle her into the bed. All was going well, but the minute I tried to leave the room her big blue eyes popped open. I gave it three more good tries, letting her know it was sleepy time, and that she was to stay in bed and close her eyes. Amelia is good at listening; she did stay in bed and she did close her eyes up tightly, but sleep just didn't come. Up she got, I fed her a nice big lunch and off we went for a two hour walk in the stroller once again! One day we are going to be successful again; it worked twice and will again. </p>
<p>The interesting thing about Amelia is that, even when she is tired, she is a such a cheerful little girl. Susan may have a different opinion about this, but she has never ever been cranky and out of sorts with me. At one point, when I was trying to convince her to sleep in bed, she looked right at me and said "awake!" and I guess she was.</p>
<p>I got her up; she ate a nice big lunch... quiche, mushroom turnover, spinach/rice, and a big drink of orange juice. Off we went immediately for our walk, since she must have been a very tired little girl by then. Less than ten minutes in her stroller and she was sleeping! If only we had a rocking bed! When she awoke at an hour and twenty minutes we were far from home, so it was a two hour and twenty minute walk for me. </p>
<p>Despite it feeling like a cool and foggy day out there, the sun had come up in Potrero Hill and I was too warm in my cotton blouse. Amelia sat up the minute she awoke and had some snacks on our way home, eating a container of yogurt as well when we got here. Susan called and we agreed to meet at the playground for pick-up at 6 p.m. I called and left a message with Akane to meet us there with Riku if she liked and she got there at 5:50. I was chatting with a woman I hoped to introduce to Susan (their daughters are only a month apart in age) and the cutest little boy ran up and grabbed my leg... Riku! It was so nice to see that beaming face! </p>
<p>Susan showed up with a brown bag full of goodies for me... (I don't think she realizes how much fun I have with Amelia!)... a big bunch of sunflowers, a bottle of "Big Pink House" wine from Santa Cruz, two bars of one of my favourite chocolate... Ritter, and boxes of organic strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and grapes! I feel guilty accepting such bounty for these days with Amelia. </p>
<p>We all sat in the playground, with me feeling like a mother bird popping pistachio nuts into Riku. Amelia had had a bowlful at home before we left along with a full container of yogurt, but when she saw Riku eating some she had a few extras too! Riku ate a bag of crackers too his mom had brought along, but first kindly shared one with Amelia.</p>
<p>Riku cried when I told him I was leaving to pick up his Grandpa; we had to do some grocery shopping. So sad. I can't bear it. Akane said she would love to go to Rainbow too, so we all left the playground together. We put Riku's stroller in the trunk of the car, I sat in the back with my favourite local boy, and off we went. Doug carried Riku around the store while I did the shopping. We met up now and then so Riku could tell me something or get a little hug. Grandpa said he was being very snuggly! </p>
<p>In the car Riku asked for yogurt and cookies; he was a hungry boy, despite the cheese samples in the store (Riku knows they have them, and always looks forward to eating each little piece off its toothpick, and then discarding it) and we dropped him and his Mom off at home at 7:30 p.m. Bryn was at his Japanese class, after missing the last two weeks.</p>
<p>It was too late for me to feel like eating much, so I had a bowl of cereal with blueberries, and I made Doug scrambled eggs, "sausages", fresh tomato slices, and two slices of the tasty bread we had picked up. </p>
<p>I went upstairs at 9 p.m. to change and brush my teeth, read a little, and woke up at 9:30 while reading! Down I came, knowing I didn't want to be awake at 5 a.m., annotated the album of photos from our day out yesterday, answered a couple of emails and am now heading up to bed... 11:20! Wow!</p>
<p>p.s. Birthday cards in today from: Zoe in England, Mykayla (from Parry Sound), Jody (from BC), and Rita McCubbin, from England as well!  </p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/a_day_at_home_with_riku.html">A Day at Home with Riku</a></h2>
								<p>Bryn dropped Riku off at 9 a.m. today. He was late to bed last night and up early this morning, so I knew he would be fading faster than usual today. I made up a big bowl of seven-grain cereal, with his favourite strawberries, and he ate it all up while sitting at the table while I ate my own breakfast. He did a little drawing and we went upstairs for a while too; at 10:30 he was sound asleep! </p>
<p>Riku napped for only an hour and a bit; he is having trouble sleeping longer in bed these days. I knew if I had put him in the car, or even in the stroller, he would have slept for another half hour or more, but I am so reluctant to give in to this. He settled down twice quickly after wakening before he finally got up, and was certainly cheerful. I can tell by how he wakened though that it wasn't as much sleep as he needed. </p>
<p>However, he was ready to eat again, and he helped me cook his breakfast... by cracking an egg, but saying "uh oh!" when some of the whites dripped, and he put the plate with the "bacon" in the microwave and pushed the button to start it up. Riku dipped his "soldiers" into the runny egg, used a fork to eat every bite of the rest of the egg, drank lots of "Super Food", and ate most of his tomatoes too. He is still coughing, and once again I was surprised by how well he is eating despite that. </p>
<p>Time for the button box again! While he was sorting through them all, I decided to sew a button on a pair of Doug's slacks. Well, now Riku knows all about "sewing circles" and "spools" and has investigated a stitch ripper, and a tape measure too. By the end of this session he could point to the number two on it. Riku must have been busy for a half hour, picking up the spools, naming the colours, twisting the thread off and on the spools, and asking "What is this?" as he found objects he had never seen before. </p>
<p>After that, Riku decided it was time for "many books" so we stacked them up on the table and read them all. It was a foggy and quite breezy day for most of the morning and early afternoon, but the sun finally came out and we went out into the yard for a bit. I planned to take him to a different neighbourhood playground today, but he needed his second nap too, and the trip didn't happen before that. </p>
<p>He had Grandpa read a few books in the living room before his nap though; he is very clear about who is going to read which books to him at any given time. At one point he was very quiet, and I found him standing in the front room again, going through all those books. The ones he likes in that room have sounds... lions, cats, a barking dog, and ducks, but he rarely asks for those to be read to him. They are perfect for the solitary times he is happy with. </p>
<p>Nap time at 3 p.m. and again he slept for just an hour and a bit, but obviously could have used more sleep. His stuffy nose probably isn't helping either, but he snuggled up with "many animals" and dozed off again a second time. As soon as Riku woke up he wanted to go upstairs... "Nana come upstairs and play with farm". I quickly washed and cut some grapes for him, got his glass of water, and went up and ironed while he moved the animals in and out of the farm, asking lots of questions about what they were doing and what the silo was for, etc. </p>
<p>The rest of our time together raced by. We went out in the yard for a bit, time enough to get the red broom out and sweep up bits, and enjoy the sunshine too, without the cool breeze in a more exposed area. Riku was just helping me tidy up his bed (he was doing his best to fold a small blanket) when Bryn walked in earlier than usual... just past 5 p.m. He planned to stay for a bit, so Riku and I went back upstairs to read more books, and I took up a plate of cucumbers, celery sticks, and carrots for me to munch on. Riku "not like cucumbers", and "not like celery"... it was bitter, but he tried them both and put them neatly out of his mouth into a Kleenex once that was decided. However, he did like the carrot sticks and ate three of them! He had cooked carrots in his afternoon "snack"... quite a hearty meal actually, so it was interesting to see that he would eat them raw too. </p>
<p>A funny thing happened though: as he was chewing them he took my two hands and held them up to his face. While I was chewing mine, he did the same with me. I was quite puzzled as to why he would do this, but the third time he did it he looked at me straigt in the eye, gently put his hands near my mouth and said "chew, chew, chew"! It was very endearing as it was so lovingly said.  </p>
<p>I had time to wash his hair at the kitchen sink and Bryn sat Riku on his lap and looked at the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/btxn3" target=_blank>photos of our trip to San Jose on Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>Off they went at 6:30 for a dinner of eel and rice. Riku called to say goodnight at 8:45 and told me he had a "big belly", as he had eaten a big dinner. </p>
<p>Doug and I had soup for dinner tonight, and Doug finished off the second last piece of his second cheesecake for dessert, a word Riku now knows very well. Grandpa and Riku both had some this afternoon. When Doug teased Riku and said it was "yucky", Riku quickly corrected him and said it was "not yucky!" Actually, as Riku was walking up the stairs this morning, he was talking about cheesecake, so he remembered it was here from two days ago! Yep, third generation for this recipe. Guess it's a keeper! </p>
<p>I went upstairs with a hot cup of tea, watched a bit of a taped Oprah, and then decided to get more of the ironing done. I thought I had finished it, but there are five more shirts awaiting me downstairs. Darn! If it weren't 11 p.m. I would finish them off; that would be a good birthday present right there, but I am not doing it. I will just ignore them completely until next week. </p>
<p>Cards in today from Susan's mom in Victoria, Judith from Maryland, Ellen from Cupertino, and Nicole from BC... and email greetings from Don, and e-cards from Becky, Carol Roberts, and Sandy too ... lucky me!</p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/happy_birthday_to_me.html">Happy Birthday to Me!</a></h2>
								<p>Today I turned 60! Hard to imagine, but there I am and not at all unhappy about it. Many years ago, when the comedienne Gilda Radner was struggling with cancer, her wish was to live long enough to celebrate her 40th birthday. She didn't make it and from that time on I vowed that every birthday for me would be a true celebration. I am looking forward to turning 90. </p>
<p>Having said that I shall write about my perfect birthday. One of the many ways my Mom had of making us feel special (not easy with ten children in the house) was by not having us do one chore all day. No making our bed, no dishes (a huge plus as it was a long job!), no running errands, and of course a birthday dinner and homemade cake of our choice. All these years later I still feel entitled to this. Now that I have no small children in the house, it happens! </p>
<p>I had a phone call from the Doering/Ellis household as I was lying in bed reading. Susan wished me a very "happy birthday", Amelia wished me a "happy", and Kevin sang to me! How lovely! Doug sang to me as well when I came downstairs so it was a good day from the very beginning. Riku was next, with a very clear "Happy Birthday Nana!" and told me we would have cake. That seems to be on his mind and certainly connected to birthdays these days. Gail and Tom called to sing their birthday wishes to me too, singing it twice so that I could hear both of them clearly.</p>
<p>The phone rang once again and it was Caillie calling from the Manitoulin, starting off the birthday wishes from northern Ontario! I spoke with all four children; they were getting ready to head off to the lake behind the house for a swim. Kelly had just finished her run, and was ready for a dip in the cool water too; I spoke with her and Irene, Gregg's mom, before they rang off. </p>
<p>Susan and Amelia had invited me to breakfast at "Just for You" with them, and as I intended to go to the Kabuki Spa afterwards, I went out unshowered and without a hair wash! Yikes! Those photos aren't the most flattering ones of me, but that's fine. I had a fresh fruit bowl and beignets... puffy, airy, delicious pastries à la New Orleans, to which Susan introduced me last year. Amelia blew out the candle Susan had placed in one of them, and we had a most enjoyable hour together. </p>
<p>Doug had some errands to run, so he drove me to the Kabuki Hot Springs... no parking, and dropped right at the door, another treat. Ah, bliss! Three hours of a quick shower, followed by three rounds of soaking in the hot tub, making myself cool off in the frigid cold tub!... yikes!... so I could more enjoy the sauna and the steam room and the cold pool in the mioddle of them all. My skin glows when I leave there; they have wonderful rosemary oil shampoo, three different types of body lotion (cucumber, verbena, and a gingery one), and the most wonderfully relaxing surroundings. Bliss, indeed! </p>
<p>Doug was outside to pick me up, dashed off for a few minutes and came back with a big beautiful bouquet of flowers from Gail and Tom! They are really gorgeous, and nicely filled the Blue Mountain pottery jug I bought years ago when a teenager. </p>
<p>Just as I was trimming the flowers, the doorbell rang, and there was a most unusual and beautiful display of flowers from Wendy and Glenn. It is perfect for the small table in the eating area while Gail's and Tom's are on the big dining room table, brightening up that quite dark room. </p>
<p>I had birthday email messages from two of Bryn's friends: Sean in San Diego, and Mark in Vancouver! I was so touched that not only did Bryn think to tell them it was my birthday, but that they took the time to write to me. Corey and Tracy also wrote warm greetings, which were lovely and unexpected, and E-cards came in from Gail, Celeste, and Zoë as well.</p>
<p>I had intended going out for a pedicure, as I had a gift certificate for that as well as the Kabuki spa. The time flew by, however, and I honestly forgot about my toes and feet. I do have to have this done before my upcoming trip to San Diego this Thursday. </p>
<p>The mail came, and with it a card from Glenna, mailed from Montréal just two days ago!, one from Judy McLean, mailed three days ago, and a home made multi-photo card from Kelly, mailed long enough ago that Kelly was concerned it wasn't going to get here. She had sent a very small "I remembered your birthday!" card a few days ago, and while I was happy to get it, I must say I was a little disappointed that it wasn't a little more special than that. And Kelly knew exactly how I would feel about it, had it all planned out, even to the choice of not-so-wonderful card, and had told her brother and Dad just what she had planned. </p>
<p>The card is just fabulous, beautifully designed, with four photos of their trip here in the spring and with heart-warming captions, enough to make my Mother's heart glow! I phoned and told her immediately that I had received it; Gregg answered the phone, wished me a happy birthday as well, and told me how happy Kelly was going to be that it arrived. We laughed about it; honestly, what a thing to put me through! </p>
<p>I spent the rest of the afternoon answering emails and puttering about. I heated up a small bowl of soup to tide me over 'til my early dinner, and read a bit of my book. However, before I knew it, it was 5:15, and Doug and I left for our early dinner at "A16", a new Italian restaurant that had great reviews for their pizza. We aren't eating out very often these days and I miss good pizza more than any other food; this seemed the perfect time to try this Cow Hollow eatery. </p>
<p>It is obviously popular, as it was crowded even at 6 p.m., an early hour for San Franciscans to be eating out. We did get a table immediately though, ordered a side dish of cannelini beans (delicious), ate too much of their good white and whole wheat breads with olive oil, and thoroughly enjoyed our individual Margherita pizzas. I did only eat half though, and intend to enjoy the second half another day soon. </p>
<p>I came home for a hot cup of tea and for gift opening; I had decided I wanted to open Doug's gifts to me tonight... so that I opened gifts on my actual birthday, but mostly because Doug buys me books and I like to have time to look them over, discuss how he came about choosing the ones he does (sometimes they are books I have asked for and Doug has been looking for for ages! and other books are titles that he found on his own for me) and relax while opening them at the leisurely pace I prefer. Once again, Doug has chosen some wonderful-sounding books for me, and I have stacked them in the front bedroom to read one at a time. I don't want them to disappear into the piles of others to read, as I have asked for many of these and Doug has found some very enticing books on his own once again!  </p>
<p>We waited to hear from Bryn as to when their dinner was over. Riku had napped late; they all went out to the playground and to 24th Street to buy bananas, and were heading home. Riku was all ready with his "Come on. Let's play!" when we walked in, and play we did, for a long long time. He, Doug, and I built with blocks for the longest time; Doug built a very tall tower and Riku waited, at his Dad's urging, to get permission before knocking it over. I got his PJs on him, brushed his teeth and we had a little more play time in the living room with the domino set. Bryn placed all the dominoes and Riku patiently waited for me to get a photo before having them all fall neatly over, one at a time. What a guy! </p>
<p>I read him two stories before Akane took over for his night time routine. The plan was for Bryn, Akane, and I to play cards but by 10 p.m. it was obvious that Akane too was sleepy. We were all reading "New Yorker" magazines, but at 10:30 Doug and I headed home for bed.</p>
<p>It has been a wonderful birthday celebration and tomorrow is the official party! More to come... </p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/the_picnic_and_the_party.html">The Picnic and the Party</a></h2>
								<p>At 8:15 a.m., while I was still asleep!, I heard a little boy calling "Nana, Nana!" I buried my head under the duvet and peeked out to see Riku looking behind the bedroom door for me! I had told Bryn last night that I would happily babysit Riku while he and Akane were busy preparing picnic food for later on today. Doug played "farm" with him on the floor in the bedroom while I quickly showered. </p>
<p>Bryn decided today that he would make me a birthday cake after all. Doug claims I made him feel very guilty about it, but really!... all I said was that I was very disappointed, but understood perfectly that life was busy, and that the very small, but good quality, cake that Doug bought would be just fine. </p>
<p>He had dropped Riku at the door downstairs, Riku rang the bell, and Doug went down to find Riku proudly standing there! Bryn phoned almost immediately to say he was on his way over to bake a German chocolate cake for me. I can't say that I tried very hard to disuede him. If there is a homemade cake at the end of the day, made by a member of my family, so much the better!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Riku and I were upstairs. I tidied up the room a bit and finished drying my hair while Riku played. He is so funny lately; he will say "TV?" knowing perfectly well I wil say no to him. I went back in to the bathroom for a minute, and came back with Riku looking very guilty; he had been pushing various buttons trying to make the tv turn on! I will certainly allow him to watch Sesame Street occasionally (after all, his Daddy loved the show at the same age), but at 10 a.m. he is always close to his naptime, and I would rather he was being more active before his nap, then than watching tv, so it won't happen often.  </p>
<p>Riku went to bed late last night and was up early this morning so Bryn hoped that he would have a good nap here before leaving for the picnic at 12:30. Despite eating a very good sized bowl of hot cereal, reading some stories, and playtime, and so obviously being tired, for some reason he just could not let go for his nap. He was so very close, his eyes closed, but then would scratch his neck or his back, or lift a leg up, or drum on his tummy... and I finally just gave in and let him up. </p>
<p>Bryn was busy making the cake and Riku was happy to join in. He dragged his little red chair over to the counter and watched the mixer turning around and around, and scraping the sides of the bowl when it stopped. I had made a list of things I wanted to take with me, so got started on that, made Riku some lunch for the car and the picnic, and got ready to get out of Bryn's way as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>Doug wanted to check out a book store over town, which was great, as the longer Riku is in the moving car the better. Still, he took a long time to fall asleep, holding out for twenty minutes. Arggh! Just when he needed it so much too. He lasted an hour, still tired though, but ate a good lunch (a hard boiled egg, raisin toast and some fruit) before getting to Baker Beach. I had worried that we would be late, as Doug took much longer in his book store than I had thought he would, but we were there just a minute before Bryn and Akane arrived, and about ten minutes before Susan, Amelia, and Kevin. Amelia's nap started later than Susan had thought it would. </p>
<p>The beach seemed too cool and windy so we set up our picnic at a table further inland. Akane had prepared some delicious battered mushrooms and broccoli, Bryn had made a very tasty pasta salad, Susan brought her wonderful potato salad with apple pieces in it, and chocolate cupcakes for dessert, as well as some cold beverages. Doug and I took two different cheeses, and I had boiled some eggs. We were quite protected here and it was more comfortable than the beach would have been on this overcast day. We immediately ate our lunch, as the children were more than ready to get moving and explore! Susan and Doug went off into the woods with Amelia and Riku, Brent showed up for lunch with us then, and we chatted until the others returned from their exploring and stick collecting adventure. </p>
<p>First the big guys climbed in the trees, and the little guys followed suit, with a little help. And then it was time for some touch football (after Kevin, Bryn, and Brent had tried hitting each other with the ball from a distance!); Amelia and Riku had such fun taking their turns and chasing after and throwing the ball too. They loved this time and Doug said had a great time in the woods too. What a day for them! Susan said we must do this more often, and not just on special occasions, and I agree. It's relaxing, is a lovely change of pace, but mostly the children just love being out of doors and wandering about aimlessly. </p>
<p>It started to get chilly, so about 4 pm. we headed for home, cake and presents, and a hot cup of tea. I was more than ready for the hot tea; it was chilly at the beach once it got later. </p>
<p>Bryn had the cakes cooling on racks, and the dishes he had used all washed up. I put them away and tidied up the picnic leftovers too, and made tea. Akane tucked herself away in the front bedroom, Susan sat in the car, with a cup of tea, while Amelia napped, Doug and Bryn continued working on the Sudoku puzzle they had started earlier at the picnic (after Bryn had put the topping on the cake), and Kevin and Riku ran madly around the house, hiding and squealing madly! How Riku loves this kind of play! All was in order in the kitchen so I took Riku upstairs for block building while Kevin had a much needed nap. He was up late last night entertaining an old friend from high school in Alaska. Riku has just started eating raw carrot sticks so he and I shared a plate of vegies, after he ate some hot pasta with cooked vegies in it, while we played. </p>
<p>Susan called from the car, where Amelia was still napping at 6:40!, to suggest ordering pizza in for dinner; no one was terribly hungry but we all needed to eat something, so I quickly defrosted some homemade tomato sauce for spaghetti, mixed a green salad, made up a plate of fresh mozzarella cheese and tomatoes, and buttered a half loaf of crusty bread with garlic butter, putting it in the oven to crisp up. </p>
<p>Amelia woke up and she and Susan came in just as Riku had been put in the tub; there was time for it, and it seemed a good idea. Akane took over while I finished up dinner preparations. He had filled the tub with every one of his tub toys, and you can barely see Riku for the toys! </p>
<p>As it was so late, and the pasta wasn't quite ready, I prepared a fresh bath for Amelia and Susan and Kevin took care of her as I put dinner on the table. </p>
<p> The food disappeared quite quickly so I guess the fresh air gave us more of an appetite than we realized. The children, of course, were anxious to get to the candle blowing, the cake, and the gift opening. They both sat at my end of the table and helped me, very efficiently, with all three of these. It was great fun having them take part! </p>
<p>Gifts.... lots of certificates for wonderful gifts!... six communal baths at the Kabuki from Kelly and Gregg, a hand painted big cup and saucer from Amelia with her finger and footprints on them, a membership for two to the Bay Area Discovery Museum from Susan and Kevin, a perfect gift for Riku and me! and time with Amelia and Susan as well at one of their favourite places, a very generous gift certificate for one of my favourite book stores, from Akane and Bryn,  lots and lots of great books from Doug, opened last night, plus a Japanese book on the tea ceremony, complete with bowl, cloth, whisk and incense, and a Kabuki gift certificate for a full session massage and two communal baths! Judi gave me a box of lovely embossed acid free note paper, which will certainly come in handy, with all the notes I have to write. And of course my two beautiful bouquets added to making this day very special. The cake was yummy! Both children dug right in, and Amelia even dug into my slice as well. </p>
<p>Bryn had quickly cleaned most of the pots and dinner prep' dishes, and Doug helped clear the table and tidy up, so in no time the house was ship-shape. </p>
<p>The party broke up late, considering there were two little ones here celebrating with us... what a lovely time we all had, but especially me, the birthday girl!  </p>

								<h2><a href="/2005/07/winding_down.html">Winding Down</a></h2>
								<p>This morning I sat in bed and finished off a book, "Winter Range"; it was a page turner, and the first I had read by this author, Claire Davis. It wasn't a mystery kind of page turner, but just a beautifully written book, with long and exquisite descriptive sentences. It was a lovely way to start my day. </p>
<p>The day was a lazy one. I had a leisurely breakfast, enjoying the sun shining through the back windows, and reading the paper. I puttered around doing bits and pieces of various things... tidying up a bit, but nothing too strenuous, answering emails, and mostly annotating photos, as Gail was very anxious to see the birthday album. Susan kindly sent off all the photos she had taken, and I sorted them into the right places. I worked on them off and on throughout the day and evening.</p>
<p>I had a bowl of Bryn's pasta salad for my lunch, with a chopped hard boiled egg on top of it. Doug didn't like the bell peppers in it, so passed, but we both had a slice of my birthday cake for dessert, followeed by a big hot cup (made by Amelia) of tea. </p>
<p>Bryn called to see if we would like to drive to IKEA in Berkeley with them, and I could sit in the car while Riku napped. They had company over for brunch and he thought it would be about 2 p.m. I suggested instead that he bring Riku over here and he could nap in the stroller; I needed a walk and Riku sleeps longer in the stroller or car these days. </p>
<p>About 3 p.m. Riku came bouncing in, ready to play, but looking pale and sleepy too. This is a boy who keeps going until he is put to bed. I helped him pull out the big basket of various toys from the laundry room, and fed him a big bowl of hot cereal, with blueberries and strawberries (at his request), and a container of Super Food. Eventually he is going to get tired of this drink! </p>
<p>I prepared some snacks for him and we set off for a "ride in the stroller"; Riku asked for his bread sticks, but fell asleep before we reached the corner! I wasn't at all surprised; he napped for two full hours and I was reluctant to have him sleep longer in case it interfered with his falling asleep tonight, starting him off on a vicious circle of going to bed too late, waking too early, and so on. So, I merely moved his seat up, which was enough to waken him. I hated to do so but...  </p>
<p>He awoke happily though, thank goodness, asked for the bread sticks and fruit bowl I had taken along for him, ate every bite, and then asked for a banana. Next time I will make sure I have toast with me and/or a banana as well! We went off to the playground, which I had promised him when we set off, and for which I had taken along his sand toys. After a little while there, we left to call his parents, as I wanted them to meet me there. Riku needed a little more playtime, and I didn't want him unhappy if I dropped him off earlier at home than he was ready for. </p>
<p>Riku spent a lot of time in the sandbox today, ran after a cat who is often near the playground, but stood and watched him quietly when the cat stopped to groom itself in a corner. He had some climbing time too, and giggled when I wiggled my fingers near his tummy from down below the playhouse. </p>
<p>I hadn't taken a jacket with me, and was getting chilly at 6:45; Riku was willing to walk home with me, and I told him I thought his Daddy would be coming soon. Just as we left the playground, Akane and Bryn turned the corner; I left his juice and sand toys with them, and walked the empty stroller home. </p>
<p>Doug was hungry and waiting for his dinner, so I quickly heated up a commercial burrito for Doug from Costco, and I a bowl of leftover salad and some fruit; not sure why I wasn't more hungry, as I had walked for over two hours, but there was no point in eating more than that. </p>
<p>Both of us sat at the computer working on the birthday photos, although I also annotated and moved some others into albums when Doug needed to get into the album. The evening passed far too quickly! </p>
<p>Riku called at 8:40 to say goodnight. This was the most amazing call we have shared; he said hello very clearly, I asked if he was ready for bed, what he had for dinner, whether he had a tub tonight, and what book his Daddy had read to him. He answered them all on his own with no prompting from Bryn at all. It was wonderful! And of course, my favourite part of the call is always the ending. "Good night, sweetheart" says I. "Goodnight sweetheart" says Riku. "See you tomorrow, I hope!" was repeated as well. "I love you" from both of us, and big smacky kisses ended the call. </p>
<p>Gail wrote twice asking where the heck the photos were! and where was the blog?... so I got busy and managed to finish them both off before going to bed. However, it turns out she had given up on me and gone to bed after all! </p>
<p>Bed at 11 p.m. </p>
