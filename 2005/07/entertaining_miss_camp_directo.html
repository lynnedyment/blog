								<h2>Entertaining "Miss Camp Director"</h2>
								<p>Amelia came by to visit today, and we had a lovely time! Susan brought her to our house, as I hoped to get her to nap in Riku's room instead of her stroller. Even though she had been rubbing her eyes at home, she perked up and hid very well any signs of being tired once she arrived here. I was just finishing up my breakfast at 9:30 when she arrived, and at 10:15 we went upstairs together; I did my flat ironing while Amelia played with the farm for a few minutes and then watched a half hour of Sesame Street. Alison Krause was on, singing about the number four! Doug missed her, as he was in the shower at the time; too bad as we are both fans of hers. Amelia likes music, almost any music as far as I can tell, so she was swaying back and forth listening and watching. She ate some pistachios and bread sticks while we were upstairs; Amelia is a big fan of the former, and I have just stocked up with another large bag of them to keep her well supplied. </p>
<p>She sat at the table and drew in her big pad of paper, while I sat beside her and read the newspaper. Of course, the "bee" came out, and Amelia pushed it around the house, then talked Doug into going to the garden to sweep. Amelia is very good at getting people to do as she tells them. She is especially adept at getting Doug to follow her orders! When he tried to go in the house and hang his broom up, she followed him in and told him "no!"... and back out he went. He needed rescuing and I laughed when he told me! I'm not quite such a pushover; good thing too, as I have a lot to do around here, even when the children visit! Just keeping the floor tidy enough to walk on safely takes some energy and time. </p>
<p>More and more, Amelia is repeating every single word back to me; I say "oh sorry" and she says "oh sorry" back! And it goes on and on, with Amelia repeating even the most difficult words. She is astounding with these verbal skills of hers! I don't think Susan or Kevin have any idea just how smart this little girl of theirs is... or maybe they do, but are too modest to say so. </p>
<p>The goal was to get Amelia to sleep in Riku's room for her nap. Well, that's all it was... a goal. It didn't happen, although we came close, she and I. At 11 a.m. Amelia was a sleepy girl; I used all my old familiar techniques... holding her in my arms for snuggling and a few very very quiet songs, putting her down when she was relaxed, and then staying with her for a few minutes to settle her into the bed. All was going well, but the minute I tried to leave the room her big blue eyes popped open. I gave it three more good tries, letting her know it was sleepy time, and that she was to stay in bed and close her eyes. Amelia is good at listening; she did stay in bed and she did close her eyes up tightly, but sleep just didn't come. Up she got, I fed her a nice big lunch and off we went for a two hour walk in the stroller once again! One day we are going to be successful again; it worked twice and will again. </p>
<p>The interesting thing about Amelia is that, even when she is tired, she is a such a cheerful little girl. Susan may have a different opinion about this, but she has never ever been cranky and out of sorts with me. At one point, when I was trying to convince her to sleep in bed, she looked right at me and said "awake!" and I guess she was.</p>
<p>I got her up; she ate a nice big lunch... quiche, mushroom turnover, spinach/rice, and a big drink of orange juice. Off we went immediately for our walk, since she must have been a very tired little girl by then. Less than ten minutes in her stroller and she was sleeping! If only we had a rocking bed! When she awoke at an hour and twenty minutes we were far from home, so it was a two hour and twenty minute walk for me. </p>
<p>Despite it feeling like a cool and foggy day out there, the sun had come up in Potrero Hill and I was too warm in my cotton blouse. Amelia sat up the minute she awoke and had some snacks on our way home, eating a container of yogurt as well when we got here. Susan called and we agreed to meet at the playground for pick-up at 6 p.m. I called and left a message with Akane to meet us there with Riku if she liked and she got there at 5:50. I was chatting with a woman I hoped to introduce to Susan (their daughters are only a month apart in age) and the cutest little boy ran up and grabbed my leg... Riku! It was so nice to see that beaming face! </p>
<p>Susan showed up with a brown bag full of goodies for me... (I don't think she realizes how much fun I have with Amelia!)... a big bunch of sunflowers, a bottle of "Big Pink House" wine from Santa Cruz, two bars of one of my favourite chocolate... Ritter, and boxes of organic strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and grapes! I feel guilty accepting such bounty for these days with Amelia. </p>
<p>We all sat in the playground, with me feeling like a mother bird popping pistachio nuts into Riku. Amelia had had a bowlful at home before we left along with a full container of yogurt, but when she saw Riku eating some she had a few extras too! Riku ate a bag of crackers too his mom had brought along, but first kindly shared one with Amelia.</p>
<p>Riku cried when I told him I was leaving to pick up his Grandpa; we had to do some grocery shopping. So sad. I can't bear it. Akane said she would love to go to Rainbow too, so we all left the playground together. We put Riku's stroller in the trunk of the car, I sat in the back with my favourite local boy, and off we went. Doug carried Riku around the store while I did the shopping. We met up now and then so Riku could tell me something or get a little hug. Grandpa said he was being very snuggly! </p>
<p>In the car Riku asked for yogurt and cookies; he was a hungry boy, despite the cheese samples in the store (Riku knows they have them, and always looks forward to eating each little piece off its toothpick, and then discarding it) and we dropped him and his Mom off at home at 7:30 p.m. Bryn was at his Japanese class, after missing the last two weeks.</p>
<p>It was too late for me to feel like eating much, so I had a bowl of cereal with blueberries, and I made Doug scrambled eggs, "sausages", fresh tomato slices, and two slices of the tasty bread we had picked up. </p>
<p>I went upstairs at 9 p.m. to change and brush my teeth, read a little, and woke up at 9:30 while reading! Down I came, knowing I didn't want to be awake at 5 a.m., annotated the album of photos from our day out yesterday, answered a couple of emails and am now heading up to bed... 11:20! Wow!</p>
<p>p.s. Birthday cards in today from: Zoe in England, Mykayla (from Parry Sound), Jody (from BC), and Rita McCubbin, from England as well!  </p>
