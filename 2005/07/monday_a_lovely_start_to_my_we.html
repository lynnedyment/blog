								<h2>Monday, a Lovely Start to My Week</h2>
								<p>Had a nice long lie-in again this morning; I slept until 7:45, showered immediately, changed the bedding, and struggled downstairs with a very full laundry basket. Got my first load in, answered some emails, made up the bed, and was them more than ready for an egg, toast, and my hot chocolate. </p>
<p>I should have gotten straight to work on the last of the paper work but instead started copying photos of Riku from Kelly and the children's visit here in March. This was a lot of work as it takes forever to place that many photos in the right spot in the new album. I helped Doug with a PEA project of his, reading him pages of numbers to slot in on the computer, and then he helped me put the photos in the right places... two hours of this. </p>
<p>However, in between, I was IM'ing with Kelly as she started working with the children on their own photo albums today. Myk' and Bry' were to be there with them for the "class", from 9-12 each day this week. Bryn and Caillie cropped and placed their photos, decorated their pages, and did some journalling as well. They went on to do two more pages and will finish journalling those before continuing on tomorrow morning. Myk' and Bry' got home in time to do two pages as well. Kelly sent me files through email of the finished products and they all did such great work on their pages! Can't wait to see them finished in person this September! How they will love having these when they are older. Lucky kids. </p>
<p>Gail called briefly with the good news that her computer problem is not a major one, thank goodness, and she may be up and running tomorrow when the new power supply comes in. </p>
<p>I had thought I would be taking Riku out for a morning trip to the playground but hadn't heard from Akane. When I called at 11:30 she was just getting his lunch ready and thought he wasn't going to be ready for his nap very soon. However, by 12:25 I hadn't heard from her, and Bryn thought they might be sleeping. He was right, and Riku napped for two and a half hours! With no nap yesterday and an early rising this morning, I am sure he is making up for lost sleep. This worked out so well for him, as an earlier nap is always better than a later afternoon one, and for me as well as I continued on with my photo work while Doug had the time to help. </p>
<p>At 4 p.m. I picked up a rested and happy little fellow and off we walked to the playground, pushing the stroller together. We had just sat down in the nice warm sand in the sandbox when Susan and Amelia arrived from Berkeley. Perfect timing and we had hoped this might work out! Riku and Amelia were happy to play together; both were rested and ran up and down the ramp, holding hands at times, climbing up and down in the little playhouse, playing on the riding toys, and in the sandbox. It was a lovely warm sunny day at the playground, until just before we left when it started to cool down. </p>
<p>Yvonne and Diego were there too so the three children had some time together. Amelia had spend the evening with Diego at his house last night, and was delighted to see him again. A black and white cat was running around the playground and of course the children were running after it! Riku snacked on some yogurt and grapes when we first got there; his nose was running and I managed to get him to drink almost a full container of water by the time we left. </p>
<p>Doug walked over at 5:15 and helped entertain the children, lifting them up and down the steps on the playhouse and keeping track of Amelia who is a fast mover! I had suggested to Akane when I left that she join us before six so she had a little fresh air and a walk, and I was so pleased when she showed up. Riku was too and went running up to her for a hug. Susan and Amelia left just as she arrived, but Bryn arrived just after 6 p.m. and we hung around watching Riku interact with three little girls who were tumbling about near the slide. He is a director and was telling the boys at the top of the slide to "move, move!" Riku had lots of slides down too though and had a fun and busy two and a half hours there. </p>
<p>We all walked home together and ended up having a very nice dinner there too; Akane cooked up some pasta, and made a delicious salad of mixed greens, blue cheese, apple slices, and a very nice vinaigrette. Riku competently sprinkled cheese on all of our dishes of pasta, helped himself to a little as well, and ate a very good sized portion of the pasta. He had answered "yes" when Bryn asked him on the way home if he was hungry and he obviously was. I was also very happy to see him drink a good sized serving of "super food" and then a glass of orange juice as well. </p>
<p>Riku entertained us at dinner with some songs; Bryn heard him singing "Itsy Bitsy Spider" a couple of days ago, complete with action, and had assumed I had taught it to him. I have sung the song a lot, and he did know the words, but we realized that the actions had come from school, as do the ones for "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star". I hadn't taught him that one at all, so he learned a lot during those three weeks! He did go over a few of the nursery rhymes he knows as well; he is getting better and better at filling in more and more of the works himself. </p>
<p>While Akane was getting dinner ready, I gave Riku a fairly quick bath, but it was enough to relax him, and slow him down for the evening. He likes to be wrapped in a big towel and carried "like a baby" these days. He does this for his Mom and Dad too which I hadn't known about. It is funny to see as he lays back so quietly and lets us admire the sweet baby I was holding. It must feel awfully comforting to be held like this. Riku also likes to be kept covered up after his tub, and so when I am putting his lotion on, I just uncover one limb at a time, as when having a massage. </p>
<p>Doug and I were completely out of staple foods in the house, milk, my soy milk, bread, eggs, etc. that we had planned to go to "Rainbow" after dropping Riku off at home. Instead I helped dry the dishes while  Doug read two books to Riku on his bed. The little guy was fading although still paying very close attention to the books he was listening to. </p>
<p>Bryn was off to ping pong at 8:30, so we all said goodnight to Riku, and Brent dropped us off at home before their ping pong game. Doug and I dashed to the store, having just enough time to pick up the few things we needed and some organic grapes and peaches for Riku. </p>
<p>Home, tea, and an hour of a taped British detective show we enjoy so much, based on novels by Elizabeth George. </p>
<p>Have had three very amusing emails from Uncle Frank the past two days in reference to the Flylady pieces I have finally started sending out again! He makes me laugh out loud. And on that note, I shall head up to bed. </p>
