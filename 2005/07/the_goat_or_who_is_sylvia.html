								<h2>"The Goat or Who is Sylvia?"</h2>
								<p>Doug and I both slept in later than is usual for us this morning; that heavy fog hanging over the city made it easy to pull the covers up and snuggle back in for an extra hour today. Going to bed at 1 a.m. helped too. </p>
<p>We both sat at our computers after reading the paper and having breakfast. I finished up the annotations for the Japanese photos at last!!!!, although I am now looking for a sheet with the names of two of the people I met there. I answered a few emails and was ready to catch the bus at 12:20. Parking is difficult downtown and especially so on Saturday so a bus seemed like a good idea. Good thing too as traffic was very heavy and we got to sit and read our books on the trip there and back.  </p>
<p>We have tickets to an Edward Albee play which started at 2 p.m. The tickets were Doug's birthday gift from Bryn, Akane, Susan, and Kevin and I was lucky enough to be included as his guest! The plan was to have lunch downtown too, but we didn't have a lot of time and prices were sky-high in that neighbourhood. A tuna sandwich for $11! or an all-day diner breakfast for $12. During the last fifteen minutes left to find something we happened upon a taqueria which got good reviews and each ordered a burrito... brown rice, ww tortilla, black beans, and salsa for $3.25. Doug added cheese to his and I avocado to mine; a big basket of chips and salsa was included as well. I ate half of mine and will have the other half for lunch tomorrow. Yum! </p>
<p>The play was in quite a small theatre so our seats at the back still gave us a very good view of centre stage. The theatre was packed full, and the play has been held over for an extra week. </p>
<p>This was true theatre! Four characters, all of whom performed very well, no intermission, and the time flew by... two and a half plus hours. It was funny, sad, disturbing somewhat, touching, quirky, and witty, with some great lines and certainly with not a slow moment in the entire play. I can see why it is a hit and we read that the actors here did a better job with it than the NYC actors two years ago. It must be a hard play to do when they first start out as it is quite outrageous material... long married couple with a gay son; life is good for all of them, until the husband's affair of six months is revealed... with a goat! Yup! Quite a story. </p>
<p>Home for hot cup of tea, after which I finally finished the ironing once more!, and watched some taped Oprah's. I ran through lots of tapes though, as many were repeats. </p>
<p>Doug and I had a light dinner after he returned from helping Bryn with his scooter (bought in Vietnam to sell at a profit here), and some play time with Riku. We watched an episode of a British detective  show we always enjoy, came downstairs for a little more computer time, and we're off to bed soon. Doug flies to L.A. at 10 a.m. tomorrow. </p>
<p>Riku called at 9:10 to say goodnight; I am enjoying this little ritual of ours. Thank you Bryn! Riku told me that he had put chopsticks down the drain! and Mommy and Daddy were angry. Oh dear! He was all ready for bed and repeated my "goodnight honey" to me before saying he would see me tomorrow. </p>
<p>Good news from Don via email. They have a conditional offer on their house and it's looking good; they hope to move into their new home on July 29th, my birthday!</p>
