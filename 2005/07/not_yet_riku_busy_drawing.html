								<h2>"Not Yet. Riku Busy Drawing"</h2>
								<p>Bryn dropped Riku off at 9 a.m. today. I was upstairs in our room, putting clothes away and ironing the last of Bryn's shirts. Riku came barrelling into the room with his big smile; I hadn't heard the doorbell. He was happy to stay upstairs playing, while I worked away. While ironing I turned on the TV for the very first time ever when Riku was here, and he watched the last five minutes of Barney; the children were sharing snacks and learning to hop, so he enjoyed it very much. He had a big grin on his face when I hopped too! Sesame Street was on next so he saw Big Bird and his Granny Bird eating cookies and sharing with Cookie Monster. When I turned the TV off, he said "more TV" but I had finished ironing and it was time to head downstairs for some breakfast.  </p>
<p>Riku sat drawing at the table while eating a very good-sized portion of porridge with fresh strawberries, and some fresh orange juice. I was glancing at the paper while he drew, but pointed out some cars that had been in an accident. This was interesting, and he asked "What else in there?" so we had a look. Also on the front page was a building under construction, and on the next page an older boy eating an ice cream cone, and then a photo of a plane that had crashed into a house, some stuffed animals, and finally a table. I got a piece of paper and we made Riku his own paper; I did the cutting and Riku did the gluing. It turned out very well, he looked at it several times during the day, showed it to his Grandpa, and insisted taking it home with him too.</p>
