								<h2>The Weekend is Over... Already!</h2>
								<p>I drove Doug to the airport today at 9 a.m. which made it seem like a Monday; of course it feels as though the weekend is over early! I came home and read the Sunday paper while eating an egg and toast and enjoying my big mug (made by Caillie) of hot chocolate. I sat and annotated Amelia's album, finished it up and got started on Riku's... all to avoid getting at the very messy pile of paper work still undone! Tomorrow for certain... </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin are off to see the play today that Doug and I saw yesterday, so I left the house at noon to drive over to their place. Amelia had had a nice long nap after breakfast and playground time with Riku and family, and was eating her lunch when I arrived. Kevin and Susan left at 12:45, Amelia finished up her lunch and we spent some time just hanging around the apartment. Susan had bought me some Japanese vegetable gyoza (pot stickers) and inari, so I ate half of those, and then had a small bowl of Susan's homemade potato salad. It was so good I had a second bowl!, and then a cup of tea. Amelia and I shared a slice of delicious lemon loaf as well, reading a few books while we did so. We also played hide-and-seek which is hilarious as Amelia "hides" in plain view and then shrieks like mad when I "find" her! I whistle to let her know where I am and she shrieks when she finds me too! It is the funniest thing to see. </p>
<p>I decided to walk to a playground in Golden Gate park rather than go to the one across the street from their house. It's lovely to have lots of time with Amelia when she isn't sleeping so this was the perfect opportunity to go to the less frequently visited play area. There was another little girl there, very close to Amelia's age... Emilia... and they must have spent a good half hour taking turns going up and down a rubber ramp being careful to switch sides and avoid bumping into each other. They were so closely matched in their abilities that is was wonderful for them; the bigger children make the platform move more than is comfortable for them. She also managed to talk her way into a fig newton from a mom! </p>
<p>Amelia loves to swing so she had a good long push and then it was back to the wooden structure. This time around Amelia tried it all backwards!... walking backwards on the swinging ramp, and backwards on the platform too. We stopped for a snack break for her; she ate some custard and drank water and then hurried back to the stairs and rope platform. Amelia is so self-assured on these various structures that it really amazes me. Children quite a bit older are much more cautious. </p>
<p>She heard sirens today, put her finger to her ear, and said "siren", nodding seriouosly, and says "backwards" very clearly as well. It's hard to remember all her newest phrases and words as they are coming on so quickly these past few weeks. </p>
<p>On the way home we stopped to watch some rollerbladers; music was playing and there were about a dozen or more people moving to music. Amelia ate all of her fresh fruit snack there and a few circle snacks on the way home. Susan and Kevin were there when we arrived, although Amelia got sidetracked by the cat in the next apartment and invited herself in to track down the cat! </p>
<p>Susan had a pot of tea ready, Kevin sliced up some fresh banana bread Susan had made, and we had a little visit. Amelia pushed her big stroller around the apartment while Kevin pushed her tiny baby stroller in front of her; it was very amusing but that's the way Amelia wanted it, even if she did get stuck and frustrated now and then. </p>
<p>I think it's going to be an early to bed night for Amelia as she was showing signs of tiredness when I left at 5:30 and Susan was going to get her right into the tub. </p>
<p>Bryn had left a message for me on the answering machine just before I got home inviting me for dinner and some play time with Riku. I had had lots to eat today and came home with the leftover Japanese treats too, so passed on dinner, and suggested that Riku come over here while Akane cooked dinner for them. Bryn brought him over and stayed, looking at the Japanese photos (and pointing out some errors that need correcting... spellings, place names...) while Riku and I swept the garden and played upstairs with the farm... of course! </p>
<p>Riku had been to his first movie today in a theatre! and walked in telling me all about the "broken castle and the broken house but the man fixed it". Whew! He had been acting it out on his bed at home before he came over but was soon busy doing other things while he was here. He even helped me pour the banana bread mixture into the pan, but I managed to forget about it while enjoying a hot cup of tea upstairs watching an Oprah tape. Darn! I am quite sure that Akane and Riku are out of banana bread by now and it made good use of the two ripe bananas I had here... </p>
<p>... and I had my phone call from Riku at 8:50, telling me he was in his pj's, his teeth were brushed and he was ready for bed. "Night honey" and "I love you" made my night. </p>
<p>Doug called later on Skype later on as well; he had a great lunch and a tasty dinner out in L.A. although couldn't get into the room where he is teaching tomorrow. So, he hopes that everything he needs will be there when he shows up tomorrow. </p>
<p>More annotating. Now to bed with paperwork awaiting me tomorrow... no more putting it off! Upstairs... 11:45 p.m.</p>
