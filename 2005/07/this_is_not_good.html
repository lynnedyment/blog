								<h2>"This is Not Good!"</h2>
								<p>How lovely it was to waken at 7:15 with Riku's sweet face next to mine. We both had a great sleep; I went to bed at 10:30 and Riku just an hour earlier, due to that terribly late nap yesterday that seemed to have no end! Bryn came over at 7:30 to take him home for breakfast with them, before Riku went to school and Bryn to work. </p>
<p>I phoned Elizabeth immediately to confirm her flight times for San Diego in August; I am hoping to go with her, depending on the cost of the flight, but needed to know just when I had to be in San Diego to meet her. We would be gone from the 4th to the 8th of August and would have the weekend free to spend with Gregory and his friend, as well as Gregory's half sister and her daughter. I do hope this pans out as Elizabeth and I have vowed to meet up for some time together once a year. The years fly by too fast to let this friendship slide. </p>
<p>Kelly "messaged" me saying all four children were home, back from their two sets of grandparents, and so I phoned and had good long chats with all of them. Caillie and Myk' were helping each other clean their bedrooms. Caillie's was not a big mess, she told me, but just had some books and papers around to clean up. Gee, she sounds like someone else I know! Bryant had fun in the Manitoulin but was happy to be home, and Bryn promised he would make me a birthday card and might even write me a letter. Bry' also thanked me for the birthday books we gave him and said he had loaned one of them to a friend. He might write me a little note after he finishes each one so that I know if he enjoyed them or not. </p>
<p>Showered, ate breakfast, read the paper and then got busy sorting through the same stack of paper work. I'm getting there but it sure is boring and is taking too long! </p>
<p>Off to pick up Riku at 12:35. He was a happy boy and came out dragging his little carry-all containing his lunch "pail", extra clothes, etc. It is a hot day here today and I sat in the back seat of the car with him with the door open wide giving him his after-school "snack" which today was banana yogurt with lots of blueberries in it. He ate a couple of cookies and drank almost a full container of water while we drove home. </p>
<p>The object of the drive is to get him here without his falling asleep. I thought I had done so well today; I had taken along a favourite flip-up book ("Spot's First Easter), and when that was done we sang songs together ("sing alligator song", "sing Jack and Jill song"), and then I made him laugh out loud by making funny throat sounds, but all to no avail, as he fell asleep three minutes before I pulled into the garage! </p>
<p>Taking him out of his car seat was no fun at all; he cried and didn't want to be disturbed. I didn't blame him a bit but sitting in the garage for two hours was not an option! I managed to carry him upstairs, get his socks, sandals, shirt and pants off, but he was not a happy little fellow while this was going on. Next time I will just pull off to a shady street and let him finish his nap, undisturbed, in the car. However, fifteen minutes later I was able to leave the room, with him sleeping soundly. </p>
<p>At forty minutes, he woke with a dirty diaper, again crying as I changed him and settled him again. And, once again, I was successful, even though he was really clinging to me, with an arm wrapped around my neck, making it more difficult to extricate myself! </p>
<p>Susan and Amelia had come in during this time. I had uncovered the pool this morning so the children could cool off in the water, and we had to add big pans of hot water to it before Amelia would agree to go in. And this is a child who walks in Ocean Beach! ... but not up to her chest. She would have stayed in longer if Riku had been in with her, but she got bored and decided it was much more fun to have her Mommy push around the other noise-maker popper, while she did the bee... her favourite. </p>
<p>Amelia looked too adorable for words in her pink and green watermelon  seed two piece swimming suit!  </p>
<p>Riku woke at the two hour mark, but wanted to do nothing more than snuggle in my arms, not go in the pool, and not get off my lap! Susan and Amelia left soon after as now Amelia was needing her nap. Riku slowly came round to his normal happy little self and had me rolling around on his bed with him. "Let's do more wrestling" says Riku! Not my favourite thing to do, as I worry about the wooden side rails (even though I cover them with the pillows) but Riku just loves it so much, that I didn't think of refusing. He just likes to tumble around, throwing the thin cotton blankets over me, and having me do the same to him. It's very funny and I saw it first with Amelia a couple of weeks ago. </p>
<p>He had a nice small "snack" of oatmeal and the bit of leftover fruit from his lunch, and finished off the few halves of pistachios we had cut for Amelia. He likes them a lot, but they are salted and I don't like him to have a lot, and he needs to be hungry for dinner in two and a half hours too. </p>
<p>Upstairs we went for our usual quiet activities in my bedroom... the farm and the camper of his Dad's, and a bit of time with the Lego. But mostly he used three little firemen from Brynnie's old toys, and put out fires, and had them climbing up on the farm to work on it. </p>
<p>When he heard his dad coming up for him at 6:15 he ran into my arms, but was perfectly happy to head for home not too much later. I suggested we walk home so that he got some more active exercise today; we ran fast for a good long block, and then spent the rest of the walk checking out the cars on the freeway, finding two! pennies, which he carried carefully home clutched in his left hand, looking to see if the dog he saw just once, months ago! was in the window, and confirming that Lily was not in her shop. </p>
<p>Bryn was waiting at their window for us to appear and scooted down to take Riku from me. He gave me kisses and a big hug and off he went with his dinner with Daddy and Mommy, saying he would see me tomorrow.</p>
<p>Back to the paperwork for me... although I did sit and finish off a magazine while drinking a hot cup of tea, but also got lots accomplished, including finding the emails and addresses of the two people in Japan I intend to write to... soon! </p>
<p>Left to pick Doug tonight at 11 p.m. I arrived just as his checked bag did... good timing! He is glad to be back in cool SF; even though it was very hot today, tonight it was cool enough that I threw a light jacket on. </p>
<p>Funny bits today:</p>
<p>... Riku had made Bryn and me laugh the other day, after looking at a "big mess" in a book and saying "This is not good!" He said it again today and made us smile; there is really something very funny about the way he says it "this is not goot" almost... </p>
<p>... Riku tonight, as I was holding him before leaving the house, leaned over and gave me a nice impulsive kiss on my cheek, and then another, and then another! </p>
