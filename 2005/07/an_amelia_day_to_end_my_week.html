								<h2>An Amelia Day to End My Week!</h2>
								<p>Well, it was a lovely day with Miss Amelia. Her mommy was having some (not magor) surgery today and so we had the day together. Kevin dropped her off at 8:30 on this sunny breezy day. Kevin told me she was already a little tired and had not eaten much so we spent some quiet time upstairs. I ironed while Amelia played with the farm, looked at some books, and meandered about in and out of the bathroom/bedroom keeping busy. She also spent some time sitting on Grandpa's lap and taking him by the hand to show him something interesting. </p>
<p>At 10:15 she ate a container of yogurt and finished off some pistachios and toast she had been nibbling on when she first arrived. I put her to sleep in Riku's room at 10:30 but she slept only 55 minutes today; I thought she was still tired but hoped she would nap a little later in the day as well. Up she got, big smiles, and was happy to go outside to feed the blue jay peanuts, and put stones in a bucket I gave to her. Once in a while she would come in and show us a stone before taking it back and adding it to her collection. </p>
<p>Of course the bee had a few turns around the house, the musical instruments were brought out from the laundry room, and she had a couple of balls rolling around too. We played ring-a-round a rosy a few times as she really loves the falling down part! </p>
<p>We read at the table while Amelia polished off all of her spinach/rice dish, her pesto pasta, and the applesauce Susan had packed for her. Usually Amelia eats smaller portions frequently but today she was happy to eat larger amounts; must be a growth spurt coming on. She stood on my scale today and weighed in at 24 pounds fully dressed. </p>
<p>Amelia has started repeating words I say right back at me and very clearly too! I told Susan yesterday that I am amazed at how quickly the hand signs have disappeared and words have emerged. At one point today Amelia dropped some pine seeds and I said "oh my goodness!" and Amelia immediately looked at me and said "oh my goo'ness". It was really adorable and is happening more often than I can say. Kevin told me tonight that just recently she has started repeating the last word of a sentence he says back at him... so he will say "It's all over" and Amelia says "over" instantly. She will be talking very well very quickly! </p>
<p>She and Doug walked a couple of blocks to the mailbox at 1:30 and on the way home Amelia wanted "up!" Not too much later, I tried to tuck her into bed, as she was yawning and rubbing her eyes. However, for whatever reason, she just would not settle, although came very very close. She's a character though! I asked her to close her eyes after they popped open when I finished singing a song, so she did as she was told... closed them up tightly, and then a minute later put both her arms across them. I couldn't see her eyes at all but knew from the smile on her face that she wasn't drifting off back to sleep! No point in her lying there, so up we got. Amelia loves turning off the ocean sounds as it means she is getting up! </p>
<p>I gave her another snack, put her on the toilet, and off we went in the stroller for a long walk/short nap I hoped. It took about a half hour before she settled in; there was a flock of pigeons to inspect first, and then a big crowd of school children out on an excursion, both of which made her sit up to comment on them! Finally, at 3:45 she was in a lovely deep sleep, which lasted for forty-five minutes. I was so pleased as I don't want her raring to go until 10 p.m. tonight for her parents! </p>
<p>We were just five minutes from the playground and we had arranged for Kevin to pick her up there. Amelia spotted that familiar corner and piped up with "playg'ound"; we had almost an hour there, with Amelia trying so hard to play with a little girl's doll stroller and finally had to settle for a ball. However, she also kept busy on a four sided teeter-totter and two rocking toys as well as the usual climbing up and down the steps of the playhouse. </p>
<p>Kevin met us at 5:30, as planned, and since Riku had not shown up with Akane, I drove back to our place with them for Kevin to pick Amelia's bag. I made a quick dinner for Doug and me, and off I went upstairs with a hot cup of tea to watch some taped Oprah's, now piling up quickly. It was just what I needed, although I should have continued on with annotating the photos from Japan. I got started at them while Amelia was sleeping... however.... </p>
<p>Marie also called and we had a long chat about her difficult day with her mom's viewing. However, she also had a fun bit of news for me. The daughter of her parent's friends was at the viewing today and told Marie she has a tape of her at "Buffalo Bandstand", a show that was very popular when we were teenagers. I am on it too, and Marie will get a copy of it made for me as well. Apparently this gal's parents had a video camera and had driven Marie there and taped some of the show. I'm sure this will be such a hoot to see, after forty-odd years! Marie had no idea it even existed, and there are also bits of her mom and dad at a party with relatives and other friends. Can't wait for September when I will see it. </p>
<p>Doug came up and we watched a taped doo wop show, which we both enjoy so much. We were singing along to those great old songs, and the highlight of it was we saw Jack Scott, who sang a song we both loved and still do... "What in the World's Come Over You?" Doug played it three times and is now busy on the computer trying to find a DVD copy of the show for us. I will certainly be sharing it with my siblings and friends. </p>
<p>Riku called at 8 p.m. to say a very quiet goodnight to me. This is very early for him to go to bed, so he must be a very tired little fellow. We talked a little bit about the puppy he held in the playground yesterday; I do have the sweetest photo of this. Ah, if only dogs weren't such a big responsibility! Riku and Amelia both would love to have a dog in their lives. </p>
<p>Good news today is that Bryn called me at 8:50 this morning to say that Riku had not cried even a bit when he left him today! Yahoo! What good news! He took in a stuffed animal from home today, so maybe that, along with knowing the main teacher will take care of him if necessary, has given him the comfort he needs to cope with his new schedule. Riku told me that he didn't play with the other children; when I asked if he played by himself he said yes. What fun it would be if we could see how he spends these four hours!</p>
