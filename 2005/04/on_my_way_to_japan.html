								<h2>On my way to Japan!</h2>
								<p>Today is the day; I'm on my way to Japan with just six days notice! In anticipation, I awoke on my own at 6:30 a.m. ... the best way for me to begin a journey. Had time to check my emails, throw in a last load of laundry, peel some carrots, address a few last cards for Doug to mail, chat with Susan and Amelia, have a short visit with Bryn (he dropped off a few things to take with me) and then organize the last bag's contents for Doug to pack in the most efficient way possible. He did it! Two bags, one weighing 29 pounds and the other 34.4 pounds. Not bad, considering I have packed a couple of loaves of whole wheat bread (hard to find here), microwave popcorn and engevita yeast (the former which I can buy here), fine organic oatmeal for Riku, a couple of veggie main courses for me, etc. etc.   </p>
<p>Doug dropped me off at the airport at 10:30 a.m. for my 12:30 flight.  With hardly anyone in line for check-in, I was through to the gate in no time. We were a half hour late boarding, so I was glad to have a good book, some yogurt, and an apple with me. </p>
<p><br />
It was a great flight; though we left forty minutes late we also arrived forty minutes early. The plane wasn't full so I quickly moved from my two seats on the aisle, with a fellow sitting in the window, to the last row on the plane, sharing a row of five with a fellow on the far end. I dozed a bit on and off, but was mostly happy sitting there reading, watching most of two movies (this is when most of the dozing took place), and eating... the delicious Asian vegetarian lunch... an orzo type cold salad with crunchy bites of veggies, a hot rice and vegetable main course, a very generous cheese plate they gave me before discovering that they did indeed have a "special" meal for me, and cookies and hot tea. They also came around with bags of chips! and mini Toblerone chocolate bars between our two meals. For some reason they seemed to think that the back row needed extra sustenance, so we got two bags of chips and three of the chocolate bars! Anyone who knows me knows that I took everything they gave me to eat! I am always hungry on a plane trip, for no reason that makes any sense at all! </p>
<p>About an hour and a half before landing, we were served a small meal; mine was so good... tiny and delicious potato pancakes with green onions, quite thin and crispy and served with a good sized portion of perfectly steamed bok choy, along with a dipping sauce with another cookie and hot tea served shortly after. </p>
<p>After the ten hour and forty minute flight, we landed at 3:50 p.m. local time, but the next day! I get my day back when I arrive home in San Francisco. I left on Friday afternoon to arrive on Saturday afternoon. Going through immigration was easy; Bryn had drawn a detailed map for me on how to find the train station, what ticket to buy, which station to go to, and the names of a couple of stations before mine. This made it easy, although I was helped at every possible point by a friendly stranger, pointing out the way to the train station (while I was looking around), a woman my age asking which station I wanted, and then waiting to make sure I put my 1000 yen note in the right place, and pushed the right button, and then she and her husband walked along with me, pointing out the particular train line I needed. It was really wonderful being assured that I was on the right track... literally! </p>
<p>It was very humid and 22C, and I was glad I had brought along the portable wheels for the two bags, and not have to struggle to carry them. The train wasn't too crowded; it was a forty-minute trip to Sakai-shi but went quickly. I recognized the area as soon as I took the elevator upstairs and easily made my way to the apartment complex. I called upstairs but someone opened the door so that by the time I stepped off the elevator on the 29th floor and walked towards the apartment I could here Riku squealing away and calling "Nana". </p>
<p>With Riku right beside me, I started unpacking my bags, giving him a few of his old familiar books I had brought with me... his very favourite "Franklin and His Blue Blanket", another Franklin book, "Are You My Mother", "The Lost Kitten" (a peekaboo book), "Small Pig", and "Frog and Toad are Friends" as well. We had a little cuddling time while reading both Franklin books and then we all went off the park on the corner for a bit to cool off. </p>
<p>Riku went down the slide a couple of times, insisting that I go down too!, but mostly he was happy just wandering around, admiring the dogs being walked, and trying very hard to get his hands into the fountain. Picking up stones is also high on the agenda and we had to convince him they didn't belong in the fountain. We'll be back here for sure.</p>
<p>Off we went to the grocery store, located in a mall just under the apartment building, to pick up some veggies and a prepared noodle dish for Akane. I ate enough for the day on the plane and wasn't the least bit hungry. Riku and I wandered through the 100 yen store too and I bought a coil notebook to use as a journal, for the days that I don't get time on the computer for this blog. Good thing I did, as I am just now typing up the first day and this is actually day 5!</p>
<p>I made Riku a bowl of hot cereal with blueberries for his dinner and as soon as he finished we read one of his daddy's favourite childhood books, "Small Pig". Riku was so fascinated with it and particularly wanted to look at the broken tv in the junk yard over and over. </p>
<p>It was still quite hot so I stood Riku up in the big bathroom sink and gave him a cooling splash time before tuck-in, which was late... 9:45. Akane wasn't feeling well until after she ate her noodle dish, and we were both tired so off we went to bed, not long after Riku. I managed to read a bit before turning off the light at 11 p.m. It's very exciting to be here!</p>
