								<h2>Saturday in SF</h2>
								<p>My first Saturday at home in over a month and the day flew by; hard to imagine that I was watching the children ski just a week ago! </p>
<p>Doug and I had appointments at 11 a.m. for our Green Card renewals and had planned to see an early movie as soon as we finished. However, an anti-choice parade along the Embaradero thwarted our plans; there were hundreds of protesters and traffic was tied up for blocks. </p>
<p>That meant that we had time for lunch before a slightly later movie... good news for me as I had a baked tofu sandwich with pesto, roasted red peppers, red onions, and mixed greens and happily sat in the theatre savouring every bite of it. Yum! </p>
<p>After the just okay movie we drove home to check our email; we were home for just over an hour. It was a busy hour though as Candy called on Skype with the news that she has bronchitis! She sounded terrible and I called her on the phone to chat so that I could hear her more clearly. Kelly also called briefly; she and Gregg have spent the day in the CM/Gregg office decluttering, clearing, cleaning etc. We talked for just a few minutes before Doug and I went off at 5:20 to babysit Amelia. </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin were attending a post-Christmas party at a friend's house so I got to feed Amelia her dinner, give her a bath, read her stories, and tuck her into bed. What a delight Amelia is! She is funny and tender and sweet as can be. </p>
<p>After she settled down Doug and I watched the last half of the Golden Globe Awards which was interesting to see. Next week the Academy Awards will be announced and we'll be watching that for sure. </p>
<p>Susan and Kevin arrived home just after 11 p.m. after a pleasant evening out, and we headed home for bed. I read a little longer than I thought I would but sleep came easily... </p>
<p>p.s. A huge snow storm hit Ottawa, Niagara Falls and Toronto today; I left just in time...</p>
