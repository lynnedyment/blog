								<h2>Amelia's Home!</h2>
								<p>Doug and I were both awake at 7:15 this morning; I could have used another hour but of course the mind starts running up my list of things to do today, and that was that! I'm still working on Neal's album and it is looking very good to me. I had a long email from By' last night, telling me what he remembered about their dog, Lucky, so that I could more easily date some of the pics. </p>
<p>I called Neal just after lunch today and was lucky enough to catch him at home. He sounded just great! We had the longest chat we've had in a long time. I didn't tell him about the album, of course, as it is a Christmas gift, but we did talk about some old memories... about my playing WKBW, much to Uncle Frank's chagrin, and Neal confirming Don's story from yesterday about their secret path to the canal. Neal said they were lucky that nothing ever happened to them, as they used to sit on the end of the slough that had water pouring out of it to drain into the canal. It sounded dangerous and I'm sure their parents knew nothing about any of it. </p>
<p>He had talked to his dad earlier in the week and thought he sounded horrible; he's worried about him too, but he phoned me about an hour later saying he had called and found his Dad in good spirits and sounding much better. We exchanged lots of emails and he does sound better, as he made lots of funny comments about the questions I asked him. </p>
<p>We picked Amelia, Susan, and Kevin up from the airport at 1:30; It was so good to see them and I think they were happy to be met. Amelia has a cold, and was tired, but slept on the plane and was as good as gold. Her mom too has a cold as the air was dry and the house where they were staying overheated. However, they had a great time in Seattle, visiting with lots of friends, and getting in lots of sight-seeing and playground visits too. </p>
<p>The bad news today was that when Doug and I walked to the corner to pick up their Honda wagon for the trip to the airport, we found it had been broken into. Glass from the small non-rolling window, was all over the back seat, with Amelia's stuffed animals scattered about, Susan's knitting bag, etc. What an awful thing to come home to; this is the fourth time they have had their windows smashed in. </p>
<p>Kevin went off to have it replaced and so I had a little visit with Amelia and Susan. Amelia wanted to go home; despite her nap on the plane she didn't want to have to get in and out of another seat again. However, she and Susan had a little time upstairs with the blocks, while I chatted with Bryn for a couple of minutes, and then Amelia played with Play-Do for a little while, and watched her favourite little "I like you" man on the computer. She also sat on the counter handing me pistachio nuts to crack open for her. </p>
<p>Turns out that Riku has a little cold again, a runny nose and a bit of a cough... guess it can't be helped with their exposure to so many children. I was hoping to talk with Riku at some point today but it never happened.  </p>
<p>Kevin was back to pick everyone up at 3:30 and I got back to my photos. I spent a lot of time asking Uncle Frank questions this afternoon and tonight, and then Doug pasted them into Windows for me, so that I could print them up to go into the album. This makes it a much more personal album, which I hope Neal will like.</p>
<p>The evening flew by; Doug was working right up until 11:30 tonight and went up to bed immediately. I have lost track of one set of photos and it's driving me slightly crazy. I hoped to have all the black and white photos in the album so that I could start on the organizing for the trip on Tuesday. I am feeling fine about it though as I have been writing things down for ages so as not to forget anything. Almost all that needs to go to Japan, except for clothes, and to Ontario in two weeks, is gathered in the front bedroom, ready for Doug to pack.</p>
<p>Marie called tonight; she hasn't been in touch via email for ages and decided to call rather than try to type a novel!  </p>
<p>Off I go to bed too; I will get more accomplished tomorrow if I am rested... and it's almost past that point already! No photos from Kelly or Bryn today... and no blogs either.</p>
