								<h2>Riku Pics, and a Half Day with Amelia...</h2>
								<p>What a treat awaited me this morning when I turned on my computer! Bryn had sent out five photos of Riku via email, and I saw that little face beaming out at me. Of course, I immediately sent them out to everyone, family and friends alike. I checked Bryn's blog site quickly but must have just assumed it was an older one, as later on Bryn told me via email that he had written up two new ones; it was better that I discovered them later, as I had to dash off to shower as soon as I had emailed the photos off. </p>
<p>Later during the day, I had a chance to hear Riku say "hello there" to me on Skype; how wonderful that Bryn now has it on his computer. We were having some problems with it as it broke up a few times, and Riku got bored as we kept calling each other, but Bryn finally realized that if he rebooted all was well. The photos, and even a few minutes of Skype, sure makes a difference in not missing him quite so much. Bryn needs to get a wee photo of Riku up on the Skype screen so that little face appears when it's up. Hint hint! </p>
<p>However, I have the most wonderful screen saver on my computer, a slideshow of all my saved photos. It always amazes both Doug and me how often both Amelia and Riku will walk by, and then stop to watch as their own faces, or any of the others drift by. The Toronto cousins are there, Manitou, the aunts, Uncle Frank, Grandpa and Nana, Mommies and Daddies... perfect! It's really a hit with all of us. Candy said when she was here in March that she would never get a thing done in the kitchen if she lived here.  </p>
<p>Amelia attended nursery school this morning, and I had planned three appointments during this time period. I started off at the dermatologist's, and then drove right to the Mission to see the acupuncturist. To my surprise, the clinic was closed; I left a message for Valerie, and drove to Noe Valley to have my hair cut. Luckily, my favourite hairdresser was available, and in less than a half hour I was out the door, very happy with the results. I called Valerie again, no answer, so decided to have a manicure/pedicure today, instead of next week, with the spare hour and a half I had before picking Amelia up. What a treat this was! For just $18 I had both my hands and my feet pampered, and got to sit in a "massage" chair for over an hour. It wasn't busy, thank goodness, and my back enjoyed every minute of those kneading rollers up and down my spine and across my shoulders. Ahhhh! </p>
<p>Amelia's nursery school is in a lovely old Victorian house in the Mission, with a huge yard and a very friendly woman in charge. This was the first time I had picked Amelia up. She gave me a huge hug and big smiles when she spotted me, and we went off to the corner gelato store, which is already a tradition for Amelia and Susan. Amelia carefully examined her choices, decided on strawberry, and after one bite decided "Nana eat it". It was delicious although I wasn't particularly hungry for it, having picked up and eaten a Chinese spinach bun and an egg roll in Noe Valley, a rare treat these days. </p>
<p>Amelia's day was a typical one with me... Play-Doh time, a good lunch here since she had chosen not to eat at school today ("Amelia not hungry"), and then the timer set for ten minutes until nap time. Amelia slept for only 55 minutes and was obviously still tired when she decided it was time to get up. She threw off the blanket, sat up and said "Amelia happy! Amelia wake up by herself!" and I knew she wouldn't go back to sleep unless I lay down with her... which I won't do. </p>
<p>After a snack, we went out into the yard and did a little sweeping, although Amelia took off her own sandals, and watched from the doorway as I finished up. Because she was tired, we sat on the sofa and read about twelve books; her favourite one today was one called "Ten Little Rubber Ducks", one of Riku's birthday books from Kelly and Gregg. At one point, she got up to do something, pointed at me and said, pointing her finger at me "You sit there" and off she went. Uncle Frank says she may have a little of Queen Victoria in her blood! </p>
<p>Amelia gave Doug lots of attention today (not that this is unusual!), handing his water bottle to him frequently, and asking to see the kaleidoscope on his computer screen, just so she can perch on his knee and give him hugs.</p>
<p>She did the funniest thing today; Riku's noisy truck was in the corner of the dining area of the kitchen, and she would go over to it, push or pull the lever, and the minute it moved or "talked"... (it says "Don't forget your hard hat" or "Caterpillar power!" and shakes), Amelia would run as fast as she could across the kitchen, and stand watching it from the sink area! She was both fascinated and terrified by it; Susan reminded me later that she is quite sensitive to noise (she never did like the loud penguin from Kelly's very much), especially loud and repetitive noises, and this truck qualifies! It was funny to see her do it over and over again though. </p>
<p>Before we knew it, it was time for Kevin to arrive, so at 5:20 I put on Amelia's shoes and we went downstairs to walk in the dark. Just before this, we had been sitting up on my bed upstairs, reading several favourite books up there ("Go Dog Go"), and admiring the sunset. It was glowing a bright golden yellow at first, then sank lower and was a gorgeous pink with long streaks, and then changing again and again. I kept saying "It's beautiful!" and Amelia would echo my opinion "It's beautiful Nana!" and it was.  </p>
<p>She enjoyed being out in the dark. We crossed the street to look at the cat sitting on a car, wandered up to see the plaque of a woman's face on one of the houses (she was a little nervous of it until I touched the long hair and the face itself), and admired a few dogs out for a walk as we walked along a bit. Kevin pulled up, got a big big hug, and Amelia blew kisses as they drove off into the now totally dark night. </p>
<p>Doug and I seem to be watching a DVD each night since joining NetFlix; if only I could stay awake for the entire movie! It's just too easy to drift off once my tummy is full and it's dark. Mom always said I was a good baby... feed me and off to sleep I would go, and it's still true, unfortunately! We watched a missing (for us) episode of "Foyle's War", a British series we both enjoyed and were happy to find the one we missed on NetFlix. I did see 95% of it though and Doug filled me in on the rest of it. </p>
<p>Yawn! I don't have any trouble falling asleep at night...</p>
