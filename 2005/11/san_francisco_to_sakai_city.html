								<h2>San Francisco to Sakai City</h2>
								<p>Today's the day; I'm off to Japan! I awoke at 6:45. It was a busy morning, but not hectic, as Doug did the final packing, and all I had to do was make sure it was all there for him. I took my one monster bag, and my old carry-on bag which will get checked as well. My two tiny carry-ons have lots of snacky foods for the flight, as well as reading material for the flight. Doug had to do some rearranging at the last minute, as the big bag weighed over 70 pounds, the legal limit for going to Japan.</p>
<p>We left for the airport at 10:15, arriving fifteen minutes later. Doug came in with me just in case I needed to move some of the weight around again, but all was well. However, all was not well with my seat as Doug had booked my flight using one of the search groups and we had forgotten to call United and book seats for all of my flights. This wasn't good, as all they had for me was a middle seat in a section of five seats, my worst flying nightmare! However, she said for $79 I could have an aisle seat in economy plus; it sure was tempting but for a one way seat it seemed a lot. We said goodbye at the security gate and while I was waiting at my gate asked if the flight was fully booked. I was told it wasn't and there was an aisle seat for me. Once on the plane I was told that fifty people didn't make this flight and so ended up with a double seat to myself, on the window!<br />
We were scheduled to leave at 12:25, but sat on the runway until 1 p.m. My flight schedule said our time to Japan would be 12 hours and fifteen minutes but the pilot announced it would be 11 hours and twenty-three minutes; I was happy to hear it might be almost an hour shorter, and settled in to read my one of the several magazines I had brought with me. We were served a pretzel snack mix and tomato juice before getting our meal about 2:30. It was hot and delicious... couscous, sweet potatoes, carrots, beans, and a tomato broiled on top. It was served with a green salad, a delicious roll, a chocolate chip cookie, and I finished off with hot tea. Our choice was "English" or "green".</p>
<p>I dozed off and on while watching two movies, "Must Love Dogs" and "Bruce Almighty". They helped pass the time but I was glad I hadn't paid to see them in a theatre. Having the extra seat beside me really helped with fatigue as I could stretch out and take up as much space as I chose to, without being aware of a passenger beside me. The time went by very quickly, and at 7 p.m. we were served a snack of sun chips, a tiny Toblerone bar, an almond cookie, and beverage service. I drank lots of water on the plane and had several cups of very strong tea with lots of milk.</p>
<p>It was strange to look out the window at 7:30 and see a brilliant blue sky with puffy white clouds. Of course I still had my watch set to SF time, so was used to it being dark by that time. A third movie kept me partially awake for a bit longer, although I also finished off the second of my magazines; "Bewitched" wasn't enough to hold my attention without a second diversion.</p>
<p>At 11 p.m. we were served a mini meal; I was glad it was hot and even though it was delicious it consisted of more sweet potatoes, this time mixed with white potatoes and baked. It came with a boring white bagel, cream cheese, applesauce, and two cookies, all of which I saved for Riku. I had noticed that at both lunch and dinner the non-vegetarian meals had come with a fruit bowl, and so I asked if there were any extras. The very thoughtful attendent brought me two of them, consisting of cantaloup, honeydew melon, and grapes. I ate both of them and then packed the two containers another attendent brought to me.</p>
<p>By 11:30 the sky had changed to the most beautiful pink with streaks, and it continued for the longest time. The pilot announced at 11:30 that we were passing over Mt. Fuji, and I was fortunate enough to be on the right side of the plane for this. I snapped a couple of photos, but by that time it was dark enough that they may not have turned out well. Hard to tell while they're still in the camera.</p>
<p>We landed at 11:55 p.m. S.F. time, just five minutes short of an eleven hour flight. Somehow we cut an hour and fifteen minutes off the original estimated time of arrival. It was such a good trip for me; I wasn't exhausted or nearly as anxious to get off the plane as I have been on the past two trips. That extra stetching space really made a difference.</p>
<p>My bags took a long time to come down the conveyer belt, but finally I went through customs and out to the big hallway to spot Bryn and Riku sitting on a bench waiting for me. It was so good to see them, and Riku was just so sweet. He gave me huge hugs, touched my face, put our noses together, and then more hugs. A few minutes later he said out of the blue, "I missed you Nana." and I told him that I sure had missed him too.</p>
<p>The train to Sakai-shi was waiting but we had time to get the suitcases on board, my two carry-ons stowed above us and the stroller folded up before it left. Riku immediately wanted the snacks I had told him I had with me, and he ate most of the applesauce, he and his dad each had a cookie although Riku insisted I have one half of his. We sang songs and chatted and looked at the lights outside, and before I knew it we were getting organized to get off for home. All looked very familiar and, after starting down the hallway to 2905, we could smell the tomato sauce Akane had prepared for our pasta dinner.</p>
<p>Akane is looking "out front" and big with this baby, but her doctor told her two days earlier that it wouldn't be any time soon. Not what we wanted to hear! The couple of hours to bedtime dashed by... our delicious dinner which included a green salad, some time admiring Riku's new fire station, which he put together on his own, with just a bit of help from Bryn, and then tuck-in time. While sitting at the table I told Riku Amelia had put some Play-Do in her mouth (I had told him I brought some with me for him) and Riku's response was "Oh, that was not good. What Auntie Susan say?" That was a new expression from him and we got quite a chuckle out of it.</p>
<p>The plan from now on is to have Riku sleep on his own in the small middle bedroom; he has been sleeping with his dad in the tatami room up to now, which is to be my room. However, we shall see how it goes. I tucked Riku into his bed, but he woke at the 45 minute mark and then again a half hour later. By that time it was close to 10:15, Akane and Bryn went off to bed and I decided I would do the same. And thus ends my first night in Japan.</p>
