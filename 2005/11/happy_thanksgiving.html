								<h2>Happy Thanksgiving!</h2>
								<p>Doug and I plan to be home all day with Doug working another full day and long night on a writing project and with me continuing on with Nea's album. </p>
<p>Bryn called on Skype just as Riku came stumbling into the "office". Riku told him he was sitting in HIS chair; Bryn takes that as a good sign as the Dyment's all have an assigned chair in their households! </p>
<p>They had plans and Riku slept in 'til almost 8, I believe, so they didn't have long to chat. However, I did get to speak to him for a few minutes, and I sang "Baby Beluga" to him before hanging up. He is off to school in less than an hour and Akane and Bryn are going to Kyoto today. </p>
<p>Oh, Doug and I gave big cheers for his success in the "toilet" room in the apartment. What a good job he is doing with two successes in two days.  </p>
<p>I got busy with the photos immediately and worked at it until Kelly messaged me, around 12:45 a.m. her time. Today is the day they are picking up the newest family member, Wiki (with a soft i); the eight week old beagle/Lab mix is going to be there to surprise the children when they get in from school this afternoon! We agreed to leave our Skypes open so we could share in the excitement of the children's reaction. Well, what a great idea that was, as we heard the children coming into the house and then four voices saying "oh, he's so cute", "can I hold her?", "she's so cute!" and Myk' was so proud of herself, as she had guessed just as she was about to go in the house that she thought the surprise was going to be a dog! </p>
<p>I have no idea where the day went today; my lower back is achy, so I've obviously be working hard, but I don't have a lot to show for it unfortunately. Doug scanned lots of photos for me today, as I came across them sorting through photos. There were lots of good responses to them, so that made it worthwhile doing! These were old family photos, which I had seen for the first time in the fall and they are all seeing for the first time now. </p>
<p>Later on Kelly sent me a lovely photo of herself holding two plates of Gregg's homemade sushi; he made it on the last weekend they were together. I must say that Kelly looked just great in the pink top and the black pants we bought her for her birthday. All those years Kelly didn't wear pink and she looks wonderful in it! </p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon and evening ran by in a blur of activity. We stopped to have our quick dinner upstairs while watching a PBS show on early Rock-a-Billy female singers. It was very interesting, showcased some great women with wonderful voices, even now, some forty or more years later. </p>
<p>And then back to work; I had a cup of hot tea while I rearranged photos from a few days ago, and so the evening passed. I meant to be in bed long before this, but started to clean up and then started the blog, hoping that perhaps Riku would be home from school before I went to bed. And it was worth the wait as Bryn did come on as soon as they walked in the house. Riku fell at school today and told me he was sad at naptime, but you can read all about it in Bryn's blog. Oh, he also said he spoke English at school today and yesterday led the class in the ABC's! When Akane picked him up at 5p.m. the teacher told her the other children would like to know some English songs so perhaps Riku will end up doing a little teaching when he is there! He did speak Japanese today though in class. </p>
<p>Didn't hear from Susan today so I have no idea what Amelia is up to; I imagine they enjoyed a delicious turkey dinner on Bainbridge Island, I believe. Oh, Mari wrote today, to wish us a Happy Thanksgiving. </p>
<p>It's 1:30. This is not good...  night night!</p>
