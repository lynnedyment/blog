								<h2>Christmas Wrapping/Photo Sorting</h2>
								<p>That's basically my day in a nut shell! I haven't had quite enough sleep after our too-late-to-bed again last night... 12:45 when Doug rolled over and then I read a little longer. However, I felt fine at 6:45 a.m., and was ready to get busy at something on my list before starting in on the photos again. </p>
<p>I had a late though leisurely breakfast, as it just seemed the right thing to do for myself today. I do especially enjoy my big mug of hot chocolate each morning! Thank you Bryn, Caillie, and Amelia for providing me with such lovely homemade mugs, as that makes it even more special. Really truly. I LOVE my big mugs! </p>
<p>I did make it upstairs finally to get started at the hidden gifts. It was a fairly big job, pulling them all out from the two storage areas, and they made a big pile on the dining room table. However, before getting to it, I did a little vacuuming in the bedroom as the cedar chest was pulled out anyway. I do put off some jobs, substituting with others that I don't enjoy at all. I am not a very patient wrapper and would love to hire someone who makes them look as gorgeous as I would really like them too. </p>
<p>First I wrapped Uncle Frank's birthday gifts and got them ready for mailing; they mustn't be late as I have had them for some time. </p>
<p>I knew it was going to take hours to do the wrapping and sorting, and it did and in a couple of hours had made a big dent in it. </p>
<p>Since we had to go out to mail the parcel, I suggested to Doug that we have a burrito out for our lunch; it has been ages (our last was when Celeste was here and treated us), since we had what used to be a once or twice a week staple! We went to a new to me place at the foot of Potrero Hill; Doug has been there a few times and it was so good, moist and tasty, a little big zingy and filling. Yum! I flirted with a darling little boy at the next table; I think he was a three year old. </p>
<p>We weren't out long as Doug had to get back to work, but it was warm and gorgeous outside and the sun felt good. The house is surprisingly cool in the mornings, and I have been turning on the heat long enough to get the chill out. We are experiencing a beautiful Indian summer and this is a week when I have spent more time in the house than usual. I need the children here to get me outdoors, especially when I am so busy. </p>
<p>Back to the gifts when we got home, and I wrapped them all, including the few birthday gifts I have bought. Still have a little more shopping to do though, so the wrapping is not over yet! </p>
<p>Doug went off to his Tai Chi lesson at 5:45; I made a cup of tea, and sat for a few minutes enjoying it. Lots of emails flying back and forth between Gail and Candy and me today, as we sort through, or comment on, family history questions and Candy's health problems. </p>
<p>While I was sorting out the gifts upstairs this morning I decided to look to see if I could find some photos from the UK I had been looking for. No luck there, but I did find three ziplock bags full of more baby, childhood, teen and University photos of Neal! Included were the school photos I asked Uncle Frank about last night, some of the letters that Neal wrote to his grandparents in Colorado, graduation programs, report cards... it was a real bonus find! </p>
<p>And now, I have to revamp the album; I have more than enough photos for two albums, so will put the coloured photos aside and concentrate on the older black and whites for Christmas. Perhaps I can get the others done for Nea's birthday in April. What lucky boys these cousins of mine are, as Auntie Rita saved so many wonderful items for them, and Uncle Frank took so many photographs. </p>
<p>Before placing any more photos I really had to sort through them, so that took up the largest chunk of my time tonight. Doug has gone to bed and I must go up to, or tomorrow I really won't get much accomplished. I'm tired and need a break. </p>
<p>But, before I go... I had a brief typing session with Bryn this morning, who filled me in on Riku's first day of school yesterday. It went very well, he was a happy boy, only napped for a half hour and then got up and played with some puzzles. I bet he sleeps tonight, as he was there from 9-5, and was a busy boy the whole day I'm sure. </p>
<p>Here is a little quote from Riku yesterday, told to me by his Dad: I was singing along with Akane/Riku to a Japanese song, and he said something like "Daddy, don't sing, it's Japanese!"  </p>
<p>If you would like to hear another line from Riku go to:</p>
<p>weblog.bigtrouble.com and read Bryn's blog for the 21st (I think!)... hmm, let me think.. it was yesterday for him, but they are a day ahead... oh, I have no idea! I'm tired and I wanna go to bed...  </p>
<p>I had a lovely email from Kei in Japan this morning, a long and newsy one too; there was a second email with a photo of Tomoha all done up in a ceremonial kimono for a special Japanese holiday. Kei says she loved both the kimono and the make-up; this almost-three year old likes being a girl! </p>
<p>The clock is striking midnight, so off I go to bed. I can't believe I haven't talked to Riku now for two days. It seems such a shame when he is so accessible on the computer, but I suppose I will hear tomorrow what he did instead of talking to his Nana! I did see some wonderful photos his Dad sent through though, so perhaps that was supposed to suffice. It didn't. Night night!</p>
