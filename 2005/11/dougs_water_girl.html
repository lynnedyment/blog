								<h2>Doug's Water Girl</h2>
								<p>Amelia arrived at 8:45 this morning after I called to see if I could spend the day with her. Susan was delighted to have some time to run errands and I was more than happy to have these hours with Amelia. She gave me a big hug when she walked in the door, and after waving goodbye to her Daddy, we came right up to get the green Play-Doh.. and then the blue, and finally the pink. We made worms and cookies and sang "pat-a-cake" before moving on to Riku's new fishing puzzle. She likes it as much as Riku did. </p>
<p>When Amelia walked up the stairs this morning she spotted the toys and games of Riku's I had set aside to take over to Hampshire Street. She picked up his headrest from Gail saying "Oh, what is this?" When I put  it around her neck to demonstrate it she said "Oh, it is beautiful!" All day long these amazing sentiments were coming forth... "Oh, sorry sweetheart", or her classic "what you doing Nana?" followed by "Oh, I see." Doug and I often just look at each other after some of the things she comes out with. </p>
<p>We read all of Riku's new birthday books today, about ten of them, and did all of her usual favourite things in the house... upstairs on her own to play with the blocks, a little drawing in her own sketch book, pulling toys out from the laundry room where many of them are stored, and checking up on everything I was doing. </p>
<p>Amelia slept from 10:30 to 11:30; it is getting so easy, as when I was getting the bed ready for her, pulling down the spread she was already up on the pillows and lying down! </p>
<p>Doug had been out in the morning and Amelia was happy to see him; she spent as much time with him as he could spare, and making sure he was well hydrated by handing him his big bottle of water several times over the course of the next few hours. </p>
<p>Amelia went down for a short nap about 3:20 and slept for only forty minutes or so. She was happy though and this means that she might be ready for bed earlier for her mom this evening. We spent the last hour outside, raking leaves and playing in the garden, and then moving to the front of the house with the chalk while waiting for Susan to pick her up. She loved this and was soon running up and down, watching Doug do the recycling/garbage routine, and being her busy self.</p>
<p> When Susan arrived Amelia went running towards the car, saying "Mommy, Mommy, Mommy... " about a dozen times. We spent a little time outside together so that Amelia could show off her running skills to all of us; she can really move fast, that little girl! And she jumps and gallops too. She was wearing her leaf green sweater and pants today, my favourite colour on her, with a soft white bow in her hair. She looked so so sweet.. and of course is! </p>
<p>Susan brought me a double batch of unopened iris tonight; they are a deep purple and are just gorgeous in my Green Mountain pottery jug. I am picking Amelia up from nursery school tomorrow at 12:30 for the very first time; it will be fun to see where she spends two mornings a week these days. She's loving it, as I knew she would. </p>
<p>Bryn started my day off with a five word email from Japan "we are here. All well." It was good to know they had arrived safely; they were just landing as Doug and I turned out the light last night. It is such a long long flight... twelve hours and fifteen minutes. Ugh! </p>
<p>While I was tucking Amelia in this afternoon, Bryn Skyped with Doug. Riku had napped for only two hours on the flight, but was an A+ travelling companion, staying in his seat with seat belt on, keeping busy with his books, his drawings, two movies, snacking, and entertaining his neigbouring seatmates and charming the flight attendant. What a good little traveller he is! Good thing too, as they will be flying back to Japan in August for his Auntie Ayako's wedding. </p>
<p>And tonight while Doug was busy on his computer, Skping with his boss, mine rang and it was Riku online! Bryn told me he had made tea in his kitchen the day before and that it was the first thing he headed for when they arrived. I'm looking forward to my first cup too, as Riku is quite the host. He had been up, along with his parents from 4 a.m. their time in Japan and hadn't been willing to go to nap six hours later! Akane and Ayako were taking him out for a stroller ride, hoping that would do the trick. It will take them all a while to adjust to the time, although Bryn was working at 6 a.m. for a full day at the "office". </p>
<p>Doug is working long long days right now, but we did take a three hour break tonight to watch the final DVD of "Angels in America". It was such a good show, although it is hard for me to sit on the bed for that long and not fall asleep. I did it last time by cracking open the walnuts that Celeste brought us last week, but ran out tonight fifteen minutes before the end! Doug rewound it for me and I managed to keep my eyes opened.</p>
