								<h2>Photo Album Day!</h2>
								<p>I went to bed last night thinking that today was the day I would start on one of my album projects; I have one in mind for Neal and one for Amelia, although Amelia's is a more casual one and not in a CM album.  </p>
<p>I answered some emails, made poached eggs, "bacon", and toast breakfast for Doug and me, read the Sunday paper whilst enjoying my hot chocolate, Skyped with Gail for a few minutes, and then called the children in Toronto. </p>
<p>Bryn had just won his second indoor soccer game against a team that hasn't lost yet, Caillie was leaving the house soon for her soccer game (it will be interesting to see if she finds it more to her liking than the outdoor games she played a couple of years ago), Myk' thought she might write me a letter today, as it has been ages since we have exchanged snail mail, and Bryant and his Dad were planning a day out to the Science Centre on their own. </p>
<p>Caillie sang the cutest song to me on the phone today; I told her that her cousin Lauren had really liked the book we sent her for her birthday. Caillie received it last year and when I told her where Lauren was up to in the book, she instantly broke out into the song. It was adorable. Then she sang a beautiful song that she will be singing at the school concert on the 3oth of this month; there were many verses to it and I would so like to get this on tape. Caillie has a lovely voice; she obviously takes after her mom and not her Nana. </p>
<p>Doug and I went through Mari's photos of Riku's birthday party, and also deleted the ones of ours that won't go in the online album. Unfortunately, Doug has too much to do today to finish off these pics, so I shall have to continue to be patient. I am not going to complain about Doug having steady work! </p>
<p>Except for time out for dinner upstairs, while watching one of our rental DVD's, a wonderful Scottish film that Doug had seen earlier in the year, called "Dear Frankie", I worked on the album for Neal all day. Of course I love this "work" so much, and really could keep at it all night. I finished 24 pages, and am up to his university days. There is still writing to be done, but I am concentrating for now on getting the photos in, in the right order! </p>
<p>I had written to Uncle Frank a few times today with various questions about Neal for the album, and hadn't heard back. I was quite concerned after hearing about his trip to the hospital last Wednesday and somehow my instinct was to call him. It was late there, 12:40 a.m. but I know that Uncle Frank does not go to bed that early and if he had he wouldn't likely hear the phone. Much to my relief, he picked the phone up almost immediately. I was right; he had had a tough day, felt weak after going out for breakfast on his own, and fell into a deep sleep after deciding to go home rather than continue with his shopping. We had a good little chat and I hung up feeling much better. </p>
<p>We dashed upstairs at 10 p.m. to watch "Gray's Anatomy" which we both like a lot, and down we came again. It's now 1:45 a.m.! Doug has just finished up the project he was working on, and I suppose it makes sense for me to turn in as well. I'm sure I will waken at 6:30 a.m. raring to go at it again. </p>
<p>I didn't talk to Riku at all today. Bryn and I typed on Skype tonight though; Akane had gone to the doctor who told her that Mireiis already bigger than Riku was, and expects her to deliver earlier than her due date, which is December 17th. This would be more than fine with all of us! Her parents want a November baby so that she won't have to wait an extra year to go to school; I want her born early in my visit (the 30th would be perfect), so that I can be there for the birth, and for Riku while Akane is in the clinic for five or six days. </p>
<p>Riku was off to a local doctor so we rang off; it is just a check up for tomorrow, Riku's first day at his new school. I shall be waiting to hear all about it, and am now waiting for today's photos from Japan! Guess I will see them tomorrow. </p>
<p>I soooo enjoyed tonight, and really wish I could find the time, and the energy to work on my albums every single day for an hour or two.</p>
