								<h2>Happy Father's Day!</h2>
								<p>Woke up at 7:10 to a bright and sunny Father's Day morning. Doug showered immediately after me, as the plan for today was to go to Hampshire Street early for breakfast and play time with Riku. He slept until after 7:30 this morning and we walked over at 8:30. </p>
<p>Riku was very happy to have us there, and he looked so cute in his light-coloured, soft, summer pj's! We immediately went to the living room for some sofa time, chatting with him and looking at some books.</p>
<p> Bryn came in with a homemade car for Doug, as well as some  delicious tiny chocolates, and a gift certificate to see a couple of movies. Perfect, as we have decided to rent movies for the next while. </p>
<p>We also played in Riku's room with his cars until Bryn had breakfast prepared... perfect lightly scrambled eggs, "bacon", delicious home fries (Bryn's own recipe with a touch of maple syrup and hot sauce added), Acme's Levain Sourdough, toasted, and hot tea. Riku sat on my lap and enjoyed his breakfast too, along with a glass of "superfood". It was a relaxing Sunday breakfast until...  </p>
<p>anxious to get back to playing as soon as he was finished, Riku and Doug went into the bedroom to build a fantastic robot. Bryn and I cleaned the kitchen while Akane showered. Bryn had suggested a trip to Muir Woods for a couple of hours. Doug was keen, as was I. I thought I hadn't been before but Kelly reminded me later that she and I had taken wee Bryn there many years ago. </p>
<p>We left around 11 a.m. and managed to beat the heavier crowds we encountered on the way home. Riku had a forty-five minute nap on the way and woke up looking forward to seeing the "big trees" he had seen a few weeks ago with his Dad, Kevin, and Amelia. We had a lovely slow stroll amongst the gorgeous tall California Redwoods; Riku stopped to collect sticks, peer over bridges, throw and drop sticks into a rippling creek, and just generally investigating anything that caught his interest. He touched a banana slug, and saw a busy grey squirrel moving about not too far from him in a tree. Doug and I walked on our own to "Cypress Grove"  and then met up with Bryn, Akane, and Riku on our walk back. It was a perfect day for this walk... sunny, but cool under the canopy of trees, and just a very restful kind of afternoon. </p>
<p>Back in the car at 3:15, we all had some snacks. Riku ate a rice cake, a few cheese bites, and cherries and grapes. I started saying some nursery rhymes to him, then sang a few favourite songs "Here We Go Gathering Nuts in May", and "Down at the Station" at which point Bryn joined in with the ones he knew too... Raffi and "Old MacDonald" ("song about chickens" asked Riku) and then finally Doug joined in too from the driver's seat with "Mares Eat Oats... " and others his Mom sang to him. It was a fun trip back but Riku was fading a bit right at the end, in need of a toes-up. We dropped them off at 3:45 p.m. after driving by "Little Angels", the Japanese daycare centre where Riku might spend six weeks this summer. He cried when we left him, which is always sad, but I hope the little nap with his Dad was all he needed. </p>
<p>Kelly called to say "Happy Father's Day" to Doug just the minute we walked in the door, although we had time for a long conversation before I passed the phone over to Doug. It's not often I get to talk with my daughter these days, and I was in Japan on Mother's Day. Doug also took time to show me the photos I took today; lots of good ones! </p>
<p>Doug drove off at 5:30 for his two day class away in Pleasanton, in the East Bay. I finished off the laundry, and then sat and worked away at my huge inbox of emails. Susan called and we chatted for a bit; it was a welcome break from sitting here! Doug also called on Skype; he got the class set up and had dinner at Chili's... a seafood burrito which he said was excellent. </p>
<p>Now 10:30 p.m. and I am on my way upstairs to bed, with a stiff neck! ... </p>
<p>p.s. Bryn has taught Riku to say "What the heck?" and it is so funny to hear him say it, with just the right attitude and inflection in his voice.</p>
