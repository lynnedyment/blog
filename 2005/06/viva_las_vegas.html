								<h2>Viva Las Vegas!</h2>
								<p>I woke at 6 a.m. today; nice to have the computer sitting right here as it gave me something to do without disturbing Doug. After writing a couple of emails I was cold and snuggled in next to Doug for a few minutes. When he got up to check his e-mail at 7:15 I jumped into the shower as we had decided to have a breakfast buffet today. </p>
<p>We ate in the Golden Nugget and had a delicious and most ample start to our day. I had eggs, potatoes, a slice of French toast, and a tiny, but very tasty, cheese blintz followed by a big plate of wonderfully fresh fruit and three cups of hot tea. Doug had an omelette as well. I brought one back with me for a late afternoon snack. </p>
<p>Doug left at 9:15 to register and go to a music store with three other fellows, and I came upstairs to e-mail away. Gail was on Skype so we had a nice little chat, catching up on the past few days. </p>
<p>At noon Doug was back as we had tickets to attend a magic show at 1 p.m. A crowd was waiting downstairs for the busses to the Strip. There were lots of familiar faces... Isobel and Roger, whom we stayed with in England four years ago, Betsy and Chuck, who visited with us a few months ago, Charles from Australia and a couple of local Bay area people too. I had some time to talk with both Betsy and Isobel on the bus, and then with Charles at the table at the show. </p>
<p>The magic show was a delight; I laughed so hard and enjoyed it so much. Doug had seen it not too long ago and was sure I would like it. I certainly did! Max King was charming in a very low-key and casual way and his patter was hilarious and the tricks very clever. We bought his book of one hundred tricks, all to do with the head! for wee Bryn for his birthday. One of them sounds utterly perfect for an eleven year old... "jab a fork in the eye ball".  </p>
<p>We caught a taxi back to the hotel with three others and once again headed off in different directions. I played some nickel machines, with no luck at all today, and so came back to the hotel to get on with my designated chores. Did lots of e-mailing to various folks... getting there slowly, one e-mail at a time. </p>
<p>At 5 p.m. I decided I was hungry and walked along Fremont Street. It was in the throes of preparation for a group wedding tonight... one hundred couples had won the opportunity to be married in Las Vegas. Brides in shorts and casual clothes had been walking around all day with veils on; they had all had their hair done I suppose but were a few hours away from the ceremony. The streets were very busy; I know because I couldn't decide on a place for dinner and walked up and down several times changing my mind about what to eat and where. The smaller places are filled with smokers and the larger restaurants with non-smoking sections were just more food than I wanted to eat on my own. After an hour of indecision I finally decided on a tuna sandwich with fries from a cafe in our hotel, and brought the sandwich up to the room to eat. </p>
<p>Doug came back at 7:30 for an e-mail break and to tell me all about his wonderful buffet dinner; I was more than ready for a cup of tea so back out I went again, to Starbucks for a big cuppa. By this time the crowds had gathered to see what they could of the ceremony. I decided I wasn't going to be able to see a thing, walked further down the street and came to the spot where the couples had lined up for the walk to the square to be married! I stood and watched all hundred of them and honestly wondered how many of them would still be together in a year. I saw them after the ceremony too, with cigarettes hanging out of their mouths, talking on their cell phones, some of them looking as though they were on their way out for a last-minute pizza in very casual clothes, but many with tuxes and elaborate gowns, and lots of family with them as well. It was fun in a very odd and Las Vegas sort of way. </p>
<p>Music was being piped in and it was soooo loud! I felt sorry for the newlyweds having to deal with the noise and the crowds, but lots of them looked very happy and in love, smiling for their family members armed with cameras. Everyone was being taped with TV cameras as well, so I suppose there is a chance that I might see some of it on TV at some point. </p>
<p>Back to the hotel after playing $5 for the day, this time in pennies! I didn't understand how many I was playing at once and it didn't take long to run through them. I sure do miss the fun, old penny slots they had years ago. Some of these have twenty lines! </p>
<p>E-mails, a hot shower to rid myself of the smoke fumes, and some reading time ended my day.</p>
