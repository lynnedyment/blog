								<h2>From  Idaho to Utah</h2>
								<p>A nice early start to our day; we were up, showered, Doug partook of the continental breakfast offered in the lobby (Tang and a sticky-bicky), and off we went at 7:20 a.m. I had a banana in the car a little later on, a few almonds and some grapes too!, saving myself for breakfast on the road. I don't ever have two eggs at home but look forward to this and taters and toast with jam when I'm travelling by car; it's a treat! </p>
<p>We stopped for gas ($2.39 a gallon filled by a nice man who would like to get to California one day) and oil before leaving town. It was sunny and bright as we started out, but the day got cloudy and overcast as we drove along. We passed long low hills with camoflage colouring; it was easy to pick out the black and white dairy cows wandering among the shrubbery. There was a factory, another factory that had been abandoned, some llamas!, a few sheep, and signs for deer. Alas, we saw only one dead one, and realized that we saw more deer in the neighbourhoods of Nanaimo than we did this entire trip! </p>
<p>Doug found a great Spanish radio station and we enjoyed the lively music as we drove along. Doug was reminded of the song "The Road Goes on Forever and the Highway Never Ends". Occasionally we are able to pick up NPR but mostly we have country music stations sliding in and out. </p>
<p>At 8:45 a.m. we drove through Ontario and left the State of Oregon for Idaho. We didn't see one potato growing but perhaps it is too early to see much. Stopped at their "Welcome to Idaho" building, took some photos, and Doug was happy to see that one can drive at 75 miles an hour here; it is the first time he can remember seeing that number on a sign. The roads were mostly empty, certainly of cars, and we shared the road with truckers, few and far between, passing a few of Bryn's favourite "England" trucks... large, shiny silver-coloured trucks that we had first noticed when we drove from Toronto to SF years ago.</p>
<p>We passed Sand Hollow, and Nampa on our way to Boise, with evangelical signs to speed us on our way, quoting scriptures, that would make it hard to keep an eye on the road if one were without a passenger reading them out!  </p>
<p>We had a late breakfast at Denny's, not our first choice but the only choice on this stretch of highway (towns are invisible from the road), and I enjoyed my plate of yep... eggs, hash browns, whole wheat toast and lots of grape jelly, along with three big mugs of hot tea. </p>
<p>On our way again at 11:30, with Mountain Home being the next town on the way. Nice address to have, wouldn't it be? Reminded me of the John Denver song... </p>
<p>Once again came long stretches of road with fields on both sides, mostly uninhabited by man or animal, but with the occasional lonely farm house on its own. Hard to imagine where the people who live there would pick up bread or milk... </p>
<p>At one point down the road, Bliss was just a mile away and the Sawtooth Mountain Range off in the distance was spectacular. At 12:30 p.m. we witnessed very strange weather patterns... light rain, pouring rain, brilliant sunshine, but with visible dark rain clouds obvious off to our right and left, as though the road had been designed to keep us clear and safe. </p>
<p>At 2:35 we entered Utah where the time changed.. actually 1:35 PST. There was very heavy rain a half hour later but with a spectacular mountain range with snowy caps in the background. We drove into Salt Lake City and since I had never been there drove right downtown to Temple Square to see what we could see. Unfortunately, the Tabernacle was closed for refurbishing but we walked around admiring the flowers and the temple from outside (only Mormon members can go inside), and ending at the Family Research Centre where we spend twenty minutes or so looking up some John Dyments and Amos Rodgers. Found lots of them and also learned that we can get all this same information online from home. Nice folks though everywhere we went in this city. </p>
<p>So, on to dinner before getting on the road again. Doug had been here on business a few times years ago, and clearly remembered a good pizza place he had eaten at twice. He wasn't certain he could find it but once he mentioned good pizza I wasn't willing to settle for anything else. He was quite sure it was on an east-west road, and remembered at one point that he could see a mountain at the end of the street, so we searched up and down a few roads. Some were dismissed as being too residential, some as too wide, and of course the city has grown and changed since he was here which only added to the task. Doug did remember, however, that it was on a south side of a corner, that the door was on the side rather than on the main road and so we continued... and found it! At one point I think that Doug was ready to give up but I encouraged him ... I was ready for pizza! And lo and behold, there it was just as he remembered it. It was called "Litza Pizza" and has been business since the 60's. We shared a garden salad and a medium eight slice pizza, with lots of cheese and a very tasty tomato sauce... all homemade including the dressing on the salad. Cost of dinner with tip and tax was $11.45! Wish we could stop there on the way home but that would take us a few hundred miles out of the way. A couple coming out of the restaurant offered to take a photo of the two of us standing outside (I was taking Doug's) and she mentioned that it wasn't New York pizza but pretty darned good nonetheless; we agreed with her. </p>
<p>I had never seen Salt Lake and was determined to do so; once again it took us a little while to find our way to the southern tip of it, and spent a half hour or so walking around. I expected it to be large and blue but at the section we were at it was somewhat murky with a layer of scummy looking algae on it. Not too impressive at this site but interesting and satisfied my urge to have seen it... took a few photos and set out again. </p>
<p>After all the driving around searching, and sightseeing, it took us longer than we had planned; Doug wants to be in Las Vegas no later than 4 p.m. tomorrow so reminded me that we had many miles to go before we slept. </p>
<p>We left there around 7:30 and drove to Fillmore, Utah, after seeing a lovely and late sunset... at 9:30 p.m. the sky was still steaky with pink but of course by our internal clocks it was still just 8:30. Fillmore was the last little town of any size for another hundred miles; instead of staying at the much-too-basic small trucker's motel we had seen advertised, we crossed to the other side of the highway and found an oasis... a big new Apple Inn, with lots of apple related "clutter", nicely decorated rooms and towels twice as big as the night before for just $56 including breakfast. Watched some tv, read a little and turned out the light.</p>
