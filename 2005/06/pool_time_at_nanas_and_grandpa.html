								<h2>Pool Time at Nana's and Grandpa's!</h2>
								<p>What a busy day it was today, and just the day I needed. I had both Amelia and Riku with me for hours which was just lovely. I slept in until almost 8 a.m., dashed into the shower, and came downstairs in time to make arrangements to pick Riku up at 9:30 so that he could go with me to the airport with Grandpa for Doug's 11 a.m. flight to New Jersey. </p>
<p>Riku decided his mommy should come with us too which worked out perfectly; we had decided to go to Costco today anyway, so instead of coming home, the three of us went off to Trader Joe's for some groceries, biding our time there until Costco opened at 11 a.m. Riku played and squealed happily with a balloon he found at the Nordstrom Rack, where we put in another fifteen minutes once we were done at Trader Joe's. The string on the balloon was just long enough that Riku could let it go and know that either his Mom or I would get it back for him. </p>
<p>We dropped Akane off at home after our Costco run. Riku was ready for his lunch despite all the toast samples he ate at Costco; the kind woman there told me to take as many as he wanted and he wanted a lot! I made him a noodly tofu soup at home, with sauteed mushrooms and fresh tomatoes on the side. He ate it all up and then it was nap time. He protested for a minute until we got back to the routine... the ocean sound turned on, his monkey, two dogs and the mouse snuggled in beside him, and his choice of blankets to lie on and cover him. Ten minutes later Riku was sound asleep. </p>
<p>Susan arrived with Amelia just a few minutes later; we shut the hallway doors and got busy working in the garden, which we had planned the night before. Susan had kindly stopped and chose a wading pool for me (part of my Las Vegas winnings are for this) and a pump. We also ate delicious cheese, avocado, lettuce, sprout and onion sandwiches she had picked up along with two types of wonderful cookies. </p>
<p>Riku woke after just an hour and helped us pump it up, and the children watched it filling with water. While this was going on he and Amelia swept away with the new child-size brooms I had bought for them before I left for Japan. The two of them were so cute together, putting weeds in the bag and sweeping before going into the cool pool (we did add hot water to it, a lot of hot water!). </p>
<p>It was a hit! Amelia crawled in and out of it, shivering away, and choosing not to be dressed, because of course she wanted the freedom to go back in when she got tired of sitting bundled up in a towel on the chair. Riku sat in it for ages, playing quietly away with some floating toys and finally coming out when I insisted, as he sat looking so obviously cold. Brr! He snuggled up against me with a towel warm from the dryer wrapped around him, and kissed me twice near my shoulder as he snuggled. He has never done that before with me, just kissed impulsively, and it was the sweetest thing. </p>
<p>Amelia on the other hand, is, as Susan puts it, a real kissing and hugging bear! And she is; she will just come up for a kiss several times an hour and gives the biggest hugs I have ever had from a child.  The yard looks so much better and soon I or we will plant the flowers that Susan also brought over with her. Now that some of the weeds are gone there is an obvious place for the bright tiny purple flowers and the others shall go in pots. The garden looked so horrible after six weeks of neglect, except for watering which Doug and Bryn took care of. </p>
<p>Susan and Amelia left about 5:45. Riku and I went upstairs for a few minutes but he decided he wanted to draw. We had just started that when Bryn walked in to take him home. Riku wasn't quite ready to be whisked away so we compromised by having me walk him home instead. This did the trick and we meandered home, stopping to look at a few interesting things along the way. He wanted me to stay for a bit so I sat with him while he ate the dinner Akane had ready for him, and then we had some playing time in his room before it was time for me to leave. </p>
<p>I was home by 7:30, not feeling energetic enough to get to work on the boxes and suitcases awaiting me, so I worked on some emails, ate a bit of dinner, and headed up for bed at 9:15 p.m. Lights out at 11, after tidying up a bit in the bedroom and reading for a bit.</p>
