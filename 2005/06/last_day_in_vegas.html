								<h2>Last Day in Vegas</h2>
								<p>Quick blog tonight; it's bedtime. Day's summary: slept in 'til 9:20 this  morning!!!! Doug had left at 8 a.m. for an early breakfast meeting and I didn't hear him getting ready or leaving. Showered immediately, couldn't get the computer up and running, so went out for a long walk up and down Fremont Street and around a few blocks. It's hot out there! </p>
<p>Back to the room around noon hour, went through a couple of magazines while waiting for Doug to come back for lunch. I was hungry and about to give up on him but phoned Isobel who said the meeting must be running late as she too was waiting. Doug arrived at 12:45 with no interest at all in eating; breakfast had been a very generous buffet, so I left him to the computer and enjoyed a long, slow brunch on my own whilst reading my book. </p>
<p>E-mailed the afternoon away, catching up on lots of long-neglected e-mails. Chatted on Skype with both Gail and Candy; Rick and Candy arrived in Nanaimo today. Gail and Tom had picked them up at 9:30 and they were on the Island by 12:30. It was great to talk with them both, and Candy and I chatted for a while when Gail went off to get dinner for the guys. </p>
<p>Doug had left at 5:45 but came up to say that if I could dress quickly I could join them for dinner tonight; someone had an extra ticket! I said goodbye to Candy and ten minutes later was out the door with Doug. Lovely to have the chance to talk with Betsy, Isobel, and Lynette too. Dinner was delicious... cream of asparagus soup (I had two small bowls), a green salad, followed by baked halibut topped with a really tasty pesto crust, potato, and green beans. Dessert was a mocha cheesecake and I had a nice big pot of tea as well. </p>
<p>We moved to another room set up as a theatre and watched a terrific performance by members of the PEA group... mind reading, of course, a comedian in the guise of a New Jersey mafia member, a terrific Canadian couple who are also mind readers, and a couple of others. Siegfried was in the audience, and then took part in the last act of the evening by Joe Atmore, a fellow who lives in the Bay area whom I have met before. </p>
<p>We took a few photos of some of these people we spent time with, and here I sit... writing my last blog of this trip. It's 12:15 and time for bed.</p>
