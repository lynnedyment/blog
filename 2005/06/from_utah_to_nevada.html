								<h2>From Utah to Nevada</h2>
								<p>After a restless night (the room was too warm and I had had things on my mind... ended up finishing a book by flashlight at 3:30 a.m.), I awoke at 7 a.m. Mountain Time. Took a long hot shower, ate a banana, and watched a little morning TV while Doug showered.</p>
<p>Our stay at the Apple Inn included breakfast, and what a great breakfast it was too. I had a bowl of hot oatmeal, a very small whole wheat bagel with light strawberry cream cheese (a new favourite food), and two glasses of orange juice. Doug had a morning pastry and orange juice, but he too treated himself to a blueberry bagel with the strawberry cream cheese. Waffles and cold cereal were available as well. We saved $10 on breakfast by eating before setting out. </p>
<p>By 8:10, we were in the car, with Doug whistling "On the Road Again". <br />
A perfectly lovely sunny day awaited us, and the truckers, on the road this morning. We were just 260 miles from Las Vegas so there was no problem reaching the city much earlier than Doug had thought we would. </p>
<p>The speed limit was 75 mph again; Doug is going to miss going this speed! We sure do put those miles behind us! Gorgeous scenery again today, although there were much longer strips of flat barren land than yesterday. However, there was a gorgeous fifteen mile stretch of spectacular mountains (the edge of the Grand Canyon) that had me wishing I could snap photos faster than was possible. </p>
<p>Immediately preceding that adventure, we had stopped to take a photo of the "Welcome to Nevada" sign, and neither of us noticed that it actually said "Welcome to Arizona"! A few miles down the road, Doug realized that the mileage markers weren't making sense to him at all... and then, seeing the <strong>actual</strong> Nevada sign, he realized that we hadn't been in Nevada until that point.  </p>
<p>We decided to turn around and take a photo of the Nevada sign, and Doug had a look at the map, showing the tiny corner of land in the southwest corner of what we had thought was Nevada to be actually the northwest corner of Arizona! So we travelled though British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, and finally had arrived in Nevada. </p>
<p>At 12:30, we reached the bright lights and the busy bustling city of Las Vegas. We are staying at the Golden Nugget in the downtown area, not on the strip. The hotel is newly decorated with new carpeting, draperies, wallpaper, etc. We are on the 18th floor of the hotel (in room 1865), a non-smoking floor, and far from the heavy and disgusting fumes of the casino floor. If I didn't like pulling those slot handles as much as I do, I would never agree to step foot in one of them! </p>
<p>Before bringing our bags up from the car, we headed right out to find a luncheon buffet. We strolled down to the Horseshoe Hotel and for less than $7.00 had a very good lunch, if high in carbs... canneloni, plain pasta with alfredo sauce (which was quite a treat for me), corn salad, fried rice, followed by a big plate of big red strawberries (not nearly as good as the ones in Gail's front garden!), pineapple, two different melon slices, and a small but delicious iced brownie with walnuts... yum! I enjoyed my three big cups of hot tea before heading back to the hotel around 2 p.m. </p>
<p>Doug set up the computer with our $12 for 24 hour internet connection while I unpacked and ironed all my blouses and slacks, much needed after five weeks of travelling. </p>
<p>Doug is out for the evening at a night-before-the-meeting gathering, and I have decided to stay in and do some catch up on e-mails, blogs, magazines, etc. My stomach is a bit off and has been since morning... wondering about the water, although Doug is fine. We walked out at 5:30 to stroll the now-cooler streets for a bit, looking for a mail box to no avail. Doug chatted with some people in the hotel lobby first and at 6:15 we went our separate ways. </p>
<p>I wandered into Fitzgerald's first, trying to find a nice friendly nickel slot, to no avail. Decided to go back to our hotel, but since our hotel offers a gold card worth $10 in slot money, I signed up for that first. I wandered around playing some nickel machines for a bit but couldn't find any nickel machines that accepted the card, so chose what turned out to be a nice lucky quarter machine. After winning just enough to keep me going for a half hour I hit one of the bigger combinations... and won $253! </p>
<p>Always nice to walk away with some extra money, and the chit for the money is still in my wallet. I came home and ate a small whole wheat bagel with cream cheese I kept from this morning and then the evening flew by! </p>
<p>Doug has just walked in the door; it's 10:30 p.m., I have answered a few e-mails, read a couple of articles in a magazine, and finished this blog... so goodnight!</p>
