								<h2>A Saturday at Home... and Happy Birthday to Gail!</h2>
								<p>I slept in this morning after turning out the light at 1 a.m; Amelia and Riku were out for breakfast with Susan, Kevin, friends of theirs and Bryn, at the "Pork Store" restaurant in the Haight. They called to say hello and it was such fun talking with both of them. Amelia said "hi" a lot, and Riku told me he was eating eggs. It was a lovelysurprise although it was very loud and we didn't talk long.  </p>
<p>I showered immediately and spent the next three hours busy on the computer... answering emails, annotatiing photos, and IM'ing with Myk' and Bryant. Lots of fun and Bry' has lots of new features to show to me. By noon hour I realized how hungry I was! I heated up three leftover pasta dishes from Amelia and Riku, and had my cup of hot chocolate while reading the paper, Quite the lazy morning! </p>
<p>I went back to dating and annotating Amelia's latest photos; there were lots of them, and Doug helped me with the dates from his machine. This saved me time, as some of Amelia's were taken with Susan's camera and were out of sequence. It had taken me a while to get organized with the camera when I first arrived home. </p>
<p>Bryn called at 2 p.m. to ask how things were going; I told him we were spending the day at home, which was just what I needed as I was getting lots of work done on the photos. He then said he wondered if I would like to see Riku, as he was going out to play ping pong with Brent. I, of course, said that would be lovely which made Bryn laugh, but of course I would rather see the children then work on photos of them! </p>
<p>Riku arrived at 2:20 and we had such a fun and busy time together. He wanted to "play upstairs" first so while he chatted away to the farm animals and played with Bryn's Fisher Price farm and camping set, I ironed all of Riku's little shirts from the laundry I did last week. I took some video of him talking away too, until I ran out of film. I must do more of this with both children... taping them, not running out of film! </p>
<p>We played on his bed with his cars and trucks, admiring how many he had, watered the garden, Riku played with a container of water as well when the watering was finished, we read books on his bed, eight in all, did some drawing, looked at pictures on the computer with Doug, ate some snacks and had such a great day together. </p>
<p>Bryn came by at 5:30 wondering if Riku would like to go home for dinner or stay here; his answer was "stay at Nana's house, eat dinner" so that is what we did. While I made dinner, he played in the sink for a long time. We called Auntie Gail to wish her a "Happy Birthday" and Riku also said it very clearly to her, and she overheard him asking for containers for the sink. He is learning more and more words and phrases every day now and it amazes me. "What is happening here?" and "Where did this come from?" or "go?" He also is very willing to repeat a word to get it correct... today we practiced "road" instead of "load" and he did it. The new sentences come so quickly I am going to have to start writing them down immediately. </p>
<p>We called Gail to sing "Happy Birthday" to her and to arrange to talk longer another day. Riku took the phone though and said very clearly "Happy Birthday, Auntie Gail" and she heard him asking for "more containers" as he was busy playing in the sink when we called. She was amazed at how much his speaking has improved just since she saw him in April, but I am amazed too as every week brings another new phrase or understanding of a new concept. </p>
<p>Doug and I walked Riku home at 7 p.m., swinging him almost the entire way. Halfway there I suggested that Riku start counting for the swing; he started off at the same pace that we did, but before long it was "One, two, three, swing!" said very very quickly! It was lots of fun and we stopped only to walk across the roads carefully. </p>
<p>As soon as we got home I got him started on his bedtime routine; he was very tired from a two hour morning nap that ended at 12:30 today so he had been up for a long time today. I rubbed him with lots of cream, as his skin has been dry lately (not much humidity here right now), got him into his pjs after he used the toilet successfully for the fourth time today just with me!, brushed his teeth, had a drink of water, and said goodnight to his Grandpa. He asked for "Walter" for his story but we couldn't find that lazy mouse book and he settled for "Are You My Mother?" instead. Riku was sound asleep before I sang two songs to him. </p>
<p>Akane and Bryn came home from their dinner in Chinatown not long after Riku was tucked in; I had just made a cup of tea, and stayed on to play a round of "Spades" leaving as soon as I had lost! Doug patiently sat and read while this was going on; I wanted some company on the way there and back and we were home at 10 p.m. Watched the final season's show of the "Super Nanny" which Doug had taped and ate some kettle corn, too late to be wise, but it sure was good! Bed at midnight.</p>
