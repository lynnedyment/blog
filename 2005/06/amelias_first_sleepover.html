								<h2>Amelia's First Sleepover</h2>
								<p>Comng downstairs without showering is not a good idea anymore; I just lounge around as though there isn't a thing to do! Gail and I msn'd by typing for a bit and then I called Candy at Gail's, as Skype isn't working for me and I wanted to say hello. I read a bit of the paper, and took my time deciding what if anything I should have for breakfast... and finally got upstairs and under the wate, much later than I had planned! </p>
<p>Susan and I were in touch to decide whether Amelia was coming over to me, or whether I was going to go to her house. Amelia made the decision easy for us, as she fell asleep on her walk with Susan, so the plan was for me to go to Ashbury Street. All well and good, until I realized I couldn't find my car keys. I searched high and low and think one of the two children must have gotten hold of them yesterday; they are no doubt tucked away somewhere! </p>
<p>I hopped in a cab as Susan had a massage appointment, giving her barely enough time to make it to the Kabuki. By this time Amelia was in her high chair having lunch and greeted me with her big enthusiastic "Hi Nana!". We took our time over her lunch and I ate the other half of her burrito; Susan had bought me a whole one, but half was all I needed, Amelia and I sat and read in the living room while I had a nice hot cup of tea. </p>
<p><br />
After that it was time for some outdoor play; I told Amelia she could take her baby stroller or her shopping cart with her and she chose the cart. After walking around the Panhandle a bit, I ended up carrying the cart into the playground, where it was a massive hit with all the other children there. Amelia wasn't happy to see someone else pushing it while she was on the swing, but finally decided it was fine. She was all too happy to use another little girl's doll stroller while her buggy was in high demand with the others.</p>
<p>Amelia scared the dickens out of me by grabbing hold of an overhead bar, just over the slide, and swinging very high with her feet up close to her bottom! She is such a strong little girl! and is obviously more comfortable with her athletic abilities than I am. I realized soon though that she was in full control, but it was still a little nerve-wracking! </p>
<p>We arrived home just a few minutes before Susan did, bearing sunflowers and lime tarts for me. I had mentioned a couple of weeks ago via email that it would be fun if Amelia could sleep over sometime. Susan and Kevin were all for it, and since Doug is away in New Jersey on business tonight and tomorrow, this seemed the perfect time. We aren't sure how it would go, so it is best that Doug not be kept awake much of the night if Amelia really needed her mommy. </p>
<p>Susan drove us home and left us about 5:30 p.m. Amelia had a hard time keeping her eyes open by the time we were almost home, but I sat in the back seat with her to encourage her to stay awake. She slept only an hour today and will be ready for an earlier night this way. This is Susan's first night away from Amelia ever, so it was no doubt a little hard for her to walk away.</p>
<p>The rest of the evening passed very quickly; dinner time first (Amelia ate a great dinner... all her spinach and rice, all of her macaroni and cheese, some of her tofu and noodles, and all of her fruit bowl... cherries, mango, green grapes, banana and strawberries!), then bath time with Robin, lotion and pj's (Amelia likes to help rub the lotion on her tummy and arms), teeth brushing (she is a great little spitter!), and finally story time. </p>
<p>There were a few mandatory tears; I held her for a few minutes but then lay her down, stroking her forehead. I went in with her to Riku's room at 7:30 and walked out at 7:50! No one was more amazed than I was; I did phone Susan to tell her the good news. </p>
<p>Amelia awakened twice after that during the next two hours... once because the phone kept ringing and ringing and she was totally aware of it, and once to call out for her Mom. I told her that it was tuck-in time, that she was to stay in bed, and would see her mommy tomorrow. And she did it all... stayed in bed, stopped crying and went to sleep clutching her tiny moose for comfort. </p>
<p>I sat and read after cleaning the kitchen, read a few emails and went off to bed with her at 10:30 p.m.</p>
