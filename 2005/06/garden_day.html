								<h2>Garden Day</h2>
								<p>My day started off with a big Amelia smile at 6:35 a.m. I think she would have slept longer, but I rolled over and did a big stretch automatically and those big blue eyes popped open. Amelia lay quietly for a few minutes, smiling and kissing me, until I told her it was wake-up time. Then off we went for our day! </p>
<p>First a diaper change after sitting on the toilet. Amelia is quite happy to try the potty and is very often successful too. I was expecting Riku early so popped right into the shower while Amelia played with the farm and animals. The minute the shower stopped I heard "hiiii!" from my little roommate, and then turned on the tv while I dried my hair; this way I could make sure she stayed upstairs and not have to listen to my too-loud dryer. </p>
<p>Amelia had some toast and juice while waiting for Riku to come over; Kevin dropped in on his way to work with Bryn, while dropping Riku off, but both children just headed up the stairs the minute Riku walked in. Bye dads! </p>
<p>What a time these two had today. It is such fun to watch them interacting; they sat drawing at the table after eating cereal and nuts, then sat on the bed playing with a basket of stones and all of the cars!, and we read a couple of books on the sofa for a little quiet time too. In between all of this, they were chasing each other around the house, Amelia got lots of bear hugs in, and they went up and down the stairs to our bedroom. They are both cautious but I am still nervous with the coming down, especially since Riku is now walking down and Amelia would be right behind him doing the same... scary for me! </p>
<p>Susan came by at 11 a.m. and found us in the garden sweeping and cleaning up a little more. We all kept busy out there for quite a long time, with breaks for snacks for the children... bananas, yogurt, more juice, and some berries. By noon hour it was obvious that they both needed their naps; Susan and Amelia went off for a walk while I tried to settle Riku into his bed. However, the fates were against me... the phone rang too often, the doorbell rang, and so I decided that Riku would nap in the stroller today. He was asleep before we got to the end of the hospital, about five minutes away! </p>
<p>It was a hot day today and I was dressed too warmly, with heavier slacks than I needed. Riku napped for only an hour, but I was forty-five minutes away from home when he woke up. He should have slept longer but something disturbed him and he decided that was enough. </p>
<p>Amelia slept for two and a half hours! Susan had picked up burritos for our lunch; I wasn't hungry until she heated up half for me, as much as I felt I should eat. I made tea, and took a cup out to Susan who was back working in the garden. By the time 6 p.m. came, my garden looked just amazing, thanks to her very hard laborious work! I had a much easier time tending to the children; they were "helping" too and often had to be distracted from not taking the dirt out of the pots Susan was planting! I got to read some stories, take photos of them rough-housing on the bed like I have never ever seen them do. It was just hilarious and I was sure someone was going to get hurt. Riku did.. he bumped his mouth into Amelia's head, threw his arms around me and cried, and stopped within a minute. Then Amelia threw her arms around me! and pretended to cry. What an actress we have on our hands; it was the funniest thing. </p>
<p>Bryn and Kevin arrived at 6:15 and the garden was looking so amazing! I have purple lobelia in a boring corner at the front of the garden, near the dining area window, and three pots of mixed flowers in various containers... out with the old, in with the new ... geraniums, lobelia, and some yellow mums. Lovely! Susan did so much weeding, a job I detest, but am determined to keep up with now that it looks so good. </p>
<p>At 7 p.m. everyone left for home, Susan needing a long hot soak, and both children tired from their busy days and all the fresh air and exercise. Doug had the other half of my burrito for dinner, so I didn't even have to cook. Worked on emails, got them down to under 20, and then went up with Doug to watch a taped show together. </p>
<p>About 8 p.m. Riku called to say goodnight to me. It was very sweet; I said "goodnight, honey" and he said "goodnight honey" to me! We had quite a nice little conversation too. </p>
<p>Bryn also called a bit later to say that he was filling out a form for Riku's daycare next week and had to describe Riku in a few words; he decided on: friendly, cautious, sociable, and gentle. That's our boy in a nutshell!  </p>
<p>Lights out at 11:30</p>
