								<h2>Gay Pride Day</h2>
								<p>I had a very short morning here at home today. I slept in a bit more than usual, and answered a few emails, leaving myself just enough time to have a small cup of hot chocolate and eating a few almonds, before leaving the house.  </p>
<p>We had asked Bryn and Akane last night if we could take Riku off to SF's biggest parade, Gay Pride Day, and at 10 a.m. we picked him up. He was excited about seeing "many people, clowns, many motorcycles, and loud music" as we discussed it all in the car on the way over to Market Street. We had to park seven long blocks away and Riku ran merrily along, stopping occasionally to look at something interesting in a window and then running until something else caught his eye. Doug was way ahead of us, but we kept his bright pink jacket in view. </p>
<p>Riku and I lucked out with a seat on the curb in front of some people with chairs. We arrived just as "Dykes on Bikes" started the parade; all those motorcycles was very exciting for Riku, but I think he liked all the waving that was going on. It didn't take long before he was waving as well, at everyone that passed by and waved to our area of the crowd. Over a million visitors are in San Francisco for this weekend, and considering the city has about 750,000 people normally, that is quite the crowd... and it was! After the motorcycles came "Mikes on Bikes" with just as many outrageous costumes, or no-clothing at all as the female contingent. </p>
<p>Riku certainly enjoyed the flag=waving (he was given a Rainbow flag from one of the attendees and this made his day!); he waved his little flag through the guard rails for the rest of our time there. He loved the brass bands, and the huge turtle, and the fellows all decked out in almost nothing but long, very long, skinny balloons, and not much else! He was also one of the lucky recipients of a pink necklace and a tiny pink rubbery ball with antennae. For a while, between events, he played with bits of coloured paper, perfectly content with scrunching it up and rolling it, until it was time to wave that flag again. It's a very friendly parade with lots of smiles from the crowd and the folks in the parade, so we all enjoyed it very much. After an hour and a half Riku said "All done, go home?" so off we went. </p>
<p>We did "one, two, three, swing!" for most of the way back to the car, although did stop to admire some stone steps along the way, with a steep wall which an older girl climbed up on. Riku declined to follow her; he is our cautious guy but he sure enjoyed watching her do it so makes a great audience! </p>
<p>Back at home I immediately gave Riku his lunch; it was obvious that he was tired, but he ate well, and sat at the table with Grandpa eating.  He was asleep just minutes after I tucked him in but woke an hour later with a dirty diaper... too bad, as it wasn't quite enough sleep for him. He was happy to lie in my arms, snuggled up with his blanket over him, but couldn't quite talk himself into letting go and nodding off again. </p>
<p>We had a wonderful afternoon together though; he played with Grandpa on the bed with the wooden blocks which haven't been used much. These belonged to both his Grandpa and his Daddy when they were little, but they work much better on the floor. I made up "better butter" and a banana bread loaf for Akane and Bryn (and Riku too!) and as soon as I was done I took over and we moved to the living room floor. Together we built quite a nice house with many turrets and bits on tops of bits; we have quite a collection of small wooden pieces which are very decorative and fit on the smallest towers. This took us a long time and then Riku decided it was time for it to come tumbling down. </p>
<p>After a snack and some drawing time (I had to draw a boat, and some small fish, and a big fish at Riku's request) Riku and I did something brand new for us. We have done a bit of "acting" before but today Riku wanted me to pretend I was "angry" and so I growled and gestured and snarled away, making him laugh out loud for such a long time. We went into "sad" and "happy" too but the one that made him laugh the most was "angry". He is so funny when he does it and he relys mostly on moving his eyebrows, which is hilarious! Later on he demonstrated this to Akane and Bryn, but not to quite the same extent. It is wonderful that he gets "pretend" so well though as it is not an easy concept for every child. </p>
<p>After that we settled in with some books... many books actually. Riku was quite happy to sit reading together and turned down the opportunity to water the garden... much to my surprise. I think it was having not quite enough sleep that made him enjoy more mellow sitting- down time with me. </p>
<p>His parents came over to get him at 5:30, waiting until we finished reading "Go Dog Go", another of his Daddy's favourite books when he was a child. </p>
<p>I made a quick dinner for Doug and me, and got busy annotating photos, finishing up Amelia's for this year and getting started on our trip from Vancouver to Las Vegas to San Francisco. </p>
<p>Riku called at 8:50 to say "good night", which is the loveliest little tradition I can think of to end my day with him. He always repeats what I call him, as I say goodnight to him, and tonight it was "goodnight sweetheart" and then ending with "goodnight sweetie" as we said a second goodbye. It's a big day tomorrow; Riku's first day at nursery school!</p>
<p>Doug was busy working on new class material for a teaching stint in Virginia over the next four days, and I kept at the photos until it was time to go up to bed. Alas, knowing I had to get up in less than six hours made it hard for me to go to sleep, and so here I am, at 1:20 a.m. writing this blog... time to turn in again though...</p>
