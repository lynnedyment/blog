								<h2>Friday, My Favourite Day of the Week</h2>
								<p>Today was a perfectly lovely day, from beginning to end. I went off to the Kabuki just after 10 a.m. and enjoyed every single minute of my soaking, steaming, and sauna time. I put conditioner in my hair, a mask on my face, scrubbed my feet with pumice, and my body with sea salt. I drank lots of water with lemons floating in it, and took many deep breaths, drifting in and out of perfect bliss time. I could do this once a week and remain sane! </p>
<p>Two and a half hours later, I picked Riku up at his house and brought him here for his afternoon nap. Akane, Doug, Riku, and I had made plans this morning to fo to the SF art gallery... SFMOMA, after his nap, and this gave Akane some time on her own today as well. Riku was a tired boy but I gave him a fresh fruit snack of blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries (a;; courtesy of Auntie Susan); he sat on the counter with Doug holding the plate for him and ate every single bite, as well as a couple of bites of a Fig Newton. </p>
<p>Unfortunately he was scrambling up the stairs before this in fun, to get away from me when he first came in the house, and hurt his nose, I thought, bumping it on the stair rise. He cried hard, and after holding him for  a while he said he would like his snack. By the time I had that ready for him it was obvious it was his eye that he had hurt. He was willing to let me hold a cold cloth on it, which I hoped would help. </p>
<p>Doug also discovered two big bumps on his forehead, one of each side, and so he looks quite a sight. I think he might have a black eye for his first day of school on Monday, poor wee guy. It was swollen and red. </p>
<p>After eating, Riku settled into bed as quickly as always, hugging his two dogs today, and covered with his soft cotton dotted blanket. Much to my surprise he slept for two hours! </p>
<p>I sat and had some tea and read the rest of the morning paper, and even got started at annotating some of the Amelia photos in her online album. I'm almost done with hers and then will get started with the latest Riku photos as well. Then the trip to Japan, Taryn's and John's wedding, and our trip from here to Vancouver, on to Las Vegas and home will complete them all... eventually! </p>
<p>Riku walked happily out to the kitchen when he woke, he wanted only to snuggle in my arms, covered with the blanket and crying fitfully when I suggested getting his shirt and pants on and picking up mommy for our trip. This is not typical behavior at all for Riku. </p>
<p>Off we went to the sofa, with Riku's head buried in my shoulder, settling in deeper and deeper into a big cuddle. He didn't want to be read to, didn't want a drink, just wanted to do just what we were doing at that moment. I'm sure he was sore and not wanting to do much of anything until he was feeling a little more secure. </p>
<p>A half hour later we were out the door to get Akane, much later than we planned originally. Akane says she thinks the bumps on his forehead are bug bites and Doug thought so too; he often gets quite a reaction to bites. We parked by a little park, promising Riku we would go back to it, and were in the gallery by 5 p.m. </p>
<p>Riku and I played with some blocks in a visitors area; he shared some of his dried cranberries and blueberries with a ten month old girl, and we looked at a couple of books until he got bored with that and wanted to wander about. We climbed all the way to the top floor, and went across a glass bridge, which Riku found totally fascinating, and into a room with a video screen mounted on a wooden structure which was hung with all sorts of strange and some ordinary objects. Riku could not take his eyes off the screen!  I was bored with it within three minutes, but the fellow on the screen was hanging upside down, opening his mouth wide, pouring green paint down the side of a wall, and pretending to cry at times. Try as I might, I could not entice him to go and look at the giant painting of a tree in the next room, or anywhere else either. Yawn! Thank goodness a guard told us they would be closing in five minutes, as it gave me the excuse to move him on out of there. Downstairs he told Doug all about the man crying and went on at great length about all the other things he saw too. Even little TV's are very powerful! </p>
<p>I carried him to the little park, where he and Grandpa climbed up on a very tall slide and Riku slid down, as did Doug and me too. Riku was delighted! An older boy was there too, and willing to share his tiny blue truck with Riku; Riku is always happy to be playing with someone so they kept busy for a bit, until his dad and Ben, a work colleage, came by to pick up Akane and Riku for dinner in Chinatown.</p>
<p>Doug and I headed right over to Susan and Kevin's to babysit for them; I had called this morning and suggested a date night to them. Susan kindly cooked up some pasta for us, and they left as soon as they had finished up their dinner and decided on a movie. </p>
<p>Amelia was a very tired girl. Susan had tried unsuccessfully to get her to nap at 1 p.m. today but she was having none of it. Amelia was pretty wired when we arrived, running around and around and wanting to be chased. We played hide and seek for a few minutes, and she sat and ate a bit of toast and cheese while I ate, but as soon as she was finished she brushed her teeth and it was tuck-in time. She was so good; she wasn't thrilled with being put to bed, but settled so quickly for me. We read two stories in her darkened room, I sang her the three bedtime songs I always sing... "Wheels on the Bus", "Rock-a-Bye-Baby" and "You're My Honey Bunch... ", with her head on my shoulder, facing towards me. I could feel her body relaxing into me, and she wasn't quite asleep when I put her in the crib. Her eyes popped opened, but when I told her it was sleepy time and she should  close her eyes, she squinched them up and I left the room, closing her doors behind me. Amazingly, that was it... thirteen minutes from story time to leaving her room. </p>
<p>Doug and I watched a rented movie of Susan and Kevin's ("Out to Sea") after I did up the dishes; I took in a cup of hot tea Susan had left for me and an hour later fell asleep with Doug rubbing my shoulders and back. I did manage to wake up in time for the last ten minutes of the movie though. </p>
<p>Susan walked in at 11 p.m., we chatted for a few minutes about their movie and ours (they haven't seen it yet), and then we went out to our car so that Kevin could pull right into our spot. Parking is at a premium at this hour of the night in most neighbourhoods. </p>
<p>Home, email, blog, bed... a lovely day indeed. </p>
<p>p.s. from Bryn in an IM this morning... </p>
<p>Riku said "broken chair, broken things" this morning; he seems to understand "things". This was from Richard Scarry... and "let's play together."</p>
<p>I replied: I like "what is happening here?" and "no taking, no taking."</p>
