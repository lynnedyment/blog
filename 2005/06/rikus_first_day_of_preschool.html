								<h2>Riku's First Day of Preschool</h2>
								<p>My day started very early, as did Doug's, as we left the house at 5:30 a.m. for the Oakland airport. Doug will be in Virginia for four days. It was 6:30 by the time I got home so there was no point in going back to bed. I had my breakfast while reading the morning paper, and then started in on my paper work. </p>
<p>Bryn had asked if I would like to accompany them to drop Riku off at "The Little Angels" daycare program, but I decided to let them take him and I will go with Akane to pick him up at 1 p.m. </p>
<p>Bryn and Akane stayed with him for twenty minutes but when it was obvious they intended to leave he cried. I suppose we all were expecting it, but it was still hard; Bryn said he cried for five minutes before he left him and then for a few more minutes more until after Akane left. Poor wee guy. He is there from 9 a.m. 'til 1 p.m. and it must have been hard for him to understand why he was being left with strangers. Sometimes being a child is tough! </p>
<p>I managed to get lots of sorting done, wrote some emails, chatted a long time with Candy on the phone, and finally packed up a small snack for Riku as I think he might need a snack before he sleeps. My guess was that he would be tired out from his busy morning. I picked Akane up at 12:30 at the studio, and we were outside the doors at 12:55. </p>
<p>Riku came barrelling out, with arms open wide, when he spotted us. He sat in the car and ate his yogurt, drank some "super food" and before I could finish one little nursery rhyme (we hoped to keep him awake long enough to tuck him in at home) he was sound asleep. Akane needed a few things at Rainbow Grocers so we stopped there; I sat and read while Riku slept and then dropped Akane at home. I parked the car in a shady spot in Potrero Hill, but he awoke after 80 minutes, still obviously tired. So... what to do??? I started up the car and drove to Ocean Beach. Riku was asleep again within minutes, but Ocean Beach seems a good destination anyway. I got to sit and read, while watching the ocean, and Riku slept for two full hours in total. We went for a walk along the beach; it was cool so I wasn't tempted to get out the sand toys, and Riku was happy to stroll and run along on his own. </p>
<p>Once it got windier and blowy we got back in the car, heading for Safeway for a bathroom stop and to pick up a sandwich for me. I was hungry! Riku happily ate some more snacks and we stopped in at almost  5 p.m. for some time with Amelia and Susan. Amelia has a tent in her room so they had fun crawling in and out of that, eating a few cookie halves, and then going over to the playground for some outside time.</p>
<p>Amelia looked particularly fetching today in a darling black and white hat, matching her sweater. The two children look ever so cute together, with her very fair hair and his dark hair. He looks like quite the little guy, especially now that he has put on some more weight, and Amelia looks dainty and slim with her chubbiness gone. </p>
<p>Amelia was her busy self on the long winding slide; Riku climbed on the steps, thought about going down, thought again and decided against it. He did this a few times and one day he will just do it! A woman there commented on just how athletic Amelia is, and she is right.While Amelia was busy with the slide and hanging from the bars, Riku  played quietly in a corner, mostly on his own, with someone else's toys. </p>
<p>Back to Susan's for just a minute to pick up some bananas for bread, and a cookbook. In just that last minute Riku bit Amelia on her hand, which looked really nasty; he knew he had done something wrong as Amelia was really crying hard. I hope that will be the very last time this happens.<br />
 <br />
After buckling Riku into his car seat, I got stuck beside a police car, while the officers ticketed someone; it seemed to take longer than the seventeen minutes I waited there. Arggh! Riku ate a half slice of banana bread, as he was hungry again, but I knew he would be eating dinner soon. </p>
<p>Dropped him off at 6:45; the first words he spoke to his dad were "Riku bite 'melia" so he obviously knew that was something wrong. Nice that he "fessed" up! </p>
<p>Home for a quick and easy dinner; I don't have much energy left due to my two and a half hours sleep last night!, so lazed about, reading on the sofa, which was such a treat, and writing a few emails before turning in at 10:20. Tonight I won't be worrying about how little sleep I will be getting and will be able to fall asleep more easily!</p>
