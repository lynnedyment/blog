								<h2>Two in Their Beds!</h2>
								<p>I awoke at 7 a.m. today and showered immediately; I had planned to pick Riku up at 11 a.m. and showering first is a good way for me to get started on my day early. It's a good thing I did, as Kevin called at 8:15. Susan was in a lot of abdominal pain and he was planning to take her to the hospital. I went over immediately, played with Amelia while Kevin was on the phone with the doctor's office and left an hour later, with nothing resolved yet. Susan was quite pale when I arrived but had some colour in her cheeks and was feeling a little better when I left. She was quite determined that she wasn't going to sit in the emergency room for three hours though... Kevin promised to keep in touch. </p>
<p>Amelia and I stopped in at Rainbow for a few groceries, and headed home. Susan told me the first word out of Amelia this morning was Riku, and at 10:45 she and I walked over to Riku's house. It was a long walk for her, but she was very excited to see Riku. They were adorable walking home together; Riku would reach out to take her hand, and he insisted on holding mine as well. The two of them did go running off together though, up and down the small ramp at the apartment building at the corner of the street and hiding in the tiny porches of the apartments on our street. </p>
<p>After "drawing" for about fifteen minutes, they both went upstairs to play for a while, and then carefully came down the stairs together. Riku now walks down but I insist that Amelia come down backwards still. The stairs are very steep and I am nervous; luckily Amelia co-operates. It was lunch time soon after and they sat together at the table to eat macaroni with sauteed mushrooms and cheese, with fresh berries and a cookie for dessert. </p>
<p>The blue jay appeared half way through their lunch, so I put out some peanuts and moved Amelia's chair so she could see the two jays picking them up. I broke some up as well, and gave each of them a couple of tiny handfulls to put on the ledge for the blue jays. As soon as the blue jays had flown off, I asked Riku what time it was and he immediately said "bedtime", which it was. Amelia had had an early morning and it was Riku's normal nap time when he is with me. </p>
<p>I have never had them both here before for their naps, and never have put Amelia in bed for hers; we always go out with her stroller. So I wasn't sure how it was going to go. I needn't have worried though, Riku played quietly upstairs "I'm busy, bulding" he told me as I picked up Amelia. She cried the tiniest bit, but I talked to her and tucked her into one of the twin beds in the front room. She snuggled very quickly into the duvet, clutching her monkey from home in her arms, and dutifully closed her eyes as I sang very softly to her and stroked her hair, her forehead and across her eyes. I walked in with her at 1 p.m. and walked out at 1:10! </p>
<p>Up I went for Riku, who just accepts the inevitable now; very rarely does he fuss about his nap time. It's a given, with a very familiar routine... a cotton blanket under his head and over him, shorts or pants off (he is a hot sleeper like Caillie), and the same singing, stroking routine while I sit beside him. At 1:22 I sat down to tell their parents they were tucked in. </p>
<p>I ate too quickly as I wasn't sure how much time I would have to clean up the kitchen and get a few little jobs done. At 1:55 Bryn wrote to see if they were still sleeping, and they were! Wow; even I was impressed! Amelia came out of the room on her own, smiling away at Doug sitting at the computer. She had slept for an hour and twenty-five minutes but had had a BC, which no doubt shortened her sleep. Riku slept exactly the same amount, walking out of his room ten minutes later. </p>
<p>Snack time... tiny quiches, dried apricots, drinks and then some popcorn, the first time I have given them any. They each had a small bowl of their own and sat very nicely munching away and looking at books. Then it was off to Riku's room for cars and rocks, and taking turns on the computer with BabyType, making lots of fun sounds by pushing on the keys. We read some stories on the bed and then they played with the tub toys! ... first time for this outside the tub; they were in the bathroom pulling them out and sharing them. </p>
<p>Susan called saying she was fine if not completely out of pain, and walking slowly home, enjoying the fresh air and sunshine. She had seen her doctor who assured her that all was well. </p>
<p>By four p.m. it was obvious that it was time for running around and having some space. Riku likes to have some quiet time and Amelia likes to be right beside Riku, so off to the playground we went. Doug came too, as we had only one stroller. Riku sat and nibbled on some snacks while Amelia walked happily along munching on hers and holding Doug's hand. We carried her for part of the time as well and reached the playground at 4:30. </p>
<p>This was just what they needed; the little inside room was open and they both enjoyed running about in there, going in and out of the tunnel and playing with a ball. We sat and rolled it to each other, one child at a time. There were so many children in the playground today with lots of toys to share. Amelia managed to snag a ride on toy and eventually found a tiny stroller as well. Riku was happy with the slide and the various bouncing toys, as well as just meandering about as he loves to do. At one point at older girl of eight or so started chasing Riku about and playing ball with him; he was a happy little fellow and she was so good with him. </p>
<p>Doug was amazed as he watched Amelia manoeuvering the little plastic riding car up three steps, figuring out each step beforehand and then carrying through with it successfully. She may be on her way to an engineering career; riding it down the ramp was the ultimate victory! </p>
<p>I took lots of photos of them and before we knew it, it was 5:50 and Kevin was there to pick up Amelia. I hope she didn't fall asleep in the car on the way home, as Susan is tired and needs an early to bed night too. </p>
<p>We dropped Riku off at home at 6:30. Akane had seen her new doctor today for the first time, her OB-GYN, and was tired out from the blood they had drawn from her. She looked very sleepy and I was happy to see Bryn on his way home, after stopping in to pick up a parcel that came for him. He was leaving just as we walked up to the house. </p>
<p>I had started preparing a spinach dish before going out, there were dishes to do, and toys to pick up, so I made a very quick dinner of pizza with some extras added to it, and cleaned the kitchen while it was baking. I am tired! </p>
<p>Doug went off to a movie with Bryn at 8:30, I made a hot cup of tea, and sat in the living room reading a magazine, dozing off a bit. And now here I sit, about to annotate a few photos before going off to bed. </p>
<p>Ah, one of the sweetest parts of my day was having Riku call at 8:20 to say "good night, sweetie" (after I had said this to him). He told me he had had his bath, and read a book... this is the third night in a row I have had this good night call, and it is the perfect almost-ending to my day.</p>
