								<h2>Two Visits and Two Movies</h2>
								<p>Ah, Saturday, with the whole weekend in front of us! I had a leisurely morning, with a long shower, a nice egg and toast breakfast, and took my time reading the paper. I then got busy and did a great job clearing off the kitchen counter; I filed various piles of statements, etc., put photos and memorabilia away, and copied various bits of information I want to save, into the right places. It has been too long since my counters were clear! </p>
<p>Just as I was finishing this up, a little boy came beaming his way in for a little visit, bringing his parents along with him. They had brought the laundry over, and started up a load. Riku had a little play time and drawing time, before they left for the open studio at Kevin's. Doug and I had lunch and left for a double feature at 12:25, dashing out when we remembered we had to stop at the post office. </p>
<p>We saw "Grizzly Man" and "Everything is Iluminated"; the first was about what I expected it to be, a beautifully photographed movie, set in Alaska, but about quite a disturbed young man who felt at one with the bears. He and his girlfriend who both mauled and eaten; grizzly indeed as it was a true story. I liked the second movie a lot, as it dealt with looking for ancestors, a project I am always interested in. The acting was superb and the landscape beautiful; despite being a little sleepy I stayed awake for both movies. </p>
<p>Home for dinner, and just as we were about to sit down, back came Riku with his Dad. Even though they hadn't planned to stay long, Riku had time to do some drawing, do some "writing letters", we read a couple of stories, and then he told me he wanted to be a doctor. He insisted we go upstairs where he told me to sit on the floor, and then gave me a needle and looked at my "hurt". I rolled up my pant leg, gave him a cotton puff and a tongue scraper with a pointy end on it, and away he went! First he wiped my knee carefully with the cotton and when I "winced" he said so sweetly "oh honey" and told me "it's okay". Then he gave me a needle and rubbed it again and gave me another needle!, and finally I got a bandage on it. A real one for a pretend hurt, but he did a great job with it all. He even had me blowing and taking deep breaths during the needle part of it; he's a fast learner and a mighty fine doctor! </p>
<p>Uncle Frank sent out a few photos from our weekend with Glenn and Wendy; there were a few of the giant steaks Glenn had cooked up and we exchanged some emails over the next hour or so. </p>
<p>Gail and I were on Skype for a long time; meanwhile, Doug cropped some photos for me, and then we went up to watch a couple of taped shows. We were both pretty tired so Doug turned all the clocks back and we were in bed reading at 11:30. That sounds so much better than the 12:30 it really was!</p>
